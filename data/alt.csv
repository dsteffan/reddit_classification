Panther here with the item compendium.

##[Here is the online GM binder version.](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Laa4RuYNr6fcDthHyT1)

##[Here is the PDF download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s1Tpzo_Cb1su-cYx4l8abnEN1UKWsdZq)

Test audiences have expressed problems with getting the document to display correctly sometimes. I have no issues, but GM binder is sometimes still a little buggy... So, if the online version is bad for you, try the PDF.

As my disclaimer in the document suggests, I have had to make edits to virtually every item that made it into the document. At first, I was adamant about PMing every OP every time I made a change.

However, after five days of doing this, I realized I was spending more time drafting PMs than I was spending on getting the items compiled. I had to streamline the process, so I basically started taking liberties with the items as I went along... Also, most items had to have their lore *significantly* trimmed. Sorry bout' that.

***If you disagree with how your item or lore turned out, please PM me. I am happy to discuss (in between my classes).***

Now. Some of you may notice that your items are not in the document. There are a few reasons that this may have occurred...

- Your item is in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/b44bv9/march_theme_month_is_treasure_week_4_the_weird/) Unfortunately, I only had about 12 days where I was able to work on this full-time. School is back in, and I am out of time. I'll casually work on getting the ""weird stuff"" items in, but I won't have very much free time until school is out in June.

- Your item was posted in the wrong thread, and I didn't notice it until I had already finished the section your item belonged in. (I really hate that this happened, but when I started running out of time, I realized I couldn't go back and fix this).

- Your item contained sexual/gross/offensive content. I probably should have made a rule about this... Oh well. Sorry y'all; I chopped out any items that contained content that offended me and at least 1 other person.

- I just couldn't figure our how to make your item 5e congruent.

- Your item required more than 1 entire page in GM Binder. (I made 1 exception to this rule). I realize this was not a stated rule; it should have been.

- Your item was too similar to an already existing item in a 5e book, or you otherwise didn't follow the submission rules.

- I somehow missed your item.

If your item didn't make it into this document, then...

### I have good news for you!

In two months, they're going to give me the event reins again! I'll have all summer to work on a version 2.0 of the compendium. I'm going to run a second round of item submissions, some time in June or July, and I'll take even more items! You can try re-submitting any items that didn't make it into the document, or try with some all new items!

Also, if you use any of these items in your games, and you come across some kind of weird exploit or inconsistency, ***please*** please tell me about it!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,21,"Hi All,

As part of our continuing theme months, April is a month of Dungeons. The schedule is in the sidebar, but I will recreate it here:

Date|Event|Premise
:--|:--|:--
1st|Dungeon Theme|Come up with a dungeon theme - [COMPLETE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/b7wzm2/april_is_dungeon_month_the_first_event_is_open/)

There are also 2 AMAs scheduled this month - on the 8th and 22nd, so tune in for those. 

---

Here's how this is going to work. Event-by-event, you can join in and create a dungeon from scratch and then release it to the subreddit at the end if the month for everyone to use. We will compile them all (and even put them into a pdf if you ask nicely) and maybe some kind citizens will volunteer to do some artwork?

Anyway, today's event is:

# Dungeon History

* What is the history of your dungeon. What did it used to be, and what was it used for, and who lived there?

* Please, only one entry per comment, but you can submit more than one theme (if you are willing to build more than one dungeon!)

# NOTE - You should link your Dungeon Theme in your History comment. Thanks!

Thanks everyone, and see you in the catacombs!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,146,"Back with another deep dive! Today we are going to explore the history of the kobolds! 

In case you missed them, we've also looked at the: [Fireball Spell](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a7292o/a_deep_dive_into_the_fireball_a_look_at_the/), [Wish Spell](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/alrs71/deep_dive_the_wish_spell_through_the_editions/) and [Barbarian Class](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ayewgv/lets_take_a_look_at_the_long_history_of_the_men/)

The Kobold.  Those annoying little rat-like creatures that have somehow survived through the editions, even though they only have 1-4 hit points.  It’s probably because there are so many of them… and that makes it nearly impossible to kill them all off. Just when you think you have all 200 of the little lizard things wiped out, those last fifty or so scurry away to breed and live to fight another day.

This deep dive will be about the kobold development in history, lore and fighting techniques. Being cannon fodder hasn’t changed much for these guys, but the creature has transformed from being a complete pushover and compared to a goblin, to now being involved in the lore of Tiamat.

&amp;nbsp;

**OD&amp;D - Kobold**
&gt; Goblin/Kobold
&gt; 
&gt; **Number Appearing:** 40-400 
&gt; 
&gt; **Armor Class:** 6/7
&gt; 
&gt; **Move in Inches:** 6
&gt; 
&gt; **Hit Dice:** 1- 1 1/2
&gt; 
&gt; **% in Lair:** 50%
&gt; 
&gt; **Type or amount of Treasure:** 1-6 G.P. ea.

Even though the kobold was one of the original creatures in D&amp;D, it didn't even merit a unique description of itself, as it was described as the weaker cousin to the goblin. This is pretty pathetic considering how weak the goblin was... and we all know that calling someone a goblin is extremely rude.

Like many of the monsters in OD&amp;D, information is pretty sparse. It is worth noticing that the number appearing is 40-400.  Can you say pack tactics anyone? Kobolds on their own, or in small groups, will run or be quickly slaughtered by even 1st level adventurers. Forty kobolds… well that’s another story altogether, though the fact that the barbarian gets a horde at higher levels means that even 400 kobolds aren’t much of an issue. Information on the kobold is pretty limited in OD&amp;D, but that is not uncommon in the original version.

What little information we have on them was released in the White Box (1974). They are listed as a Chaos monster and the DM was told to treat them as a goblin… but weaker. Not a bright day for the Kobold back then, which is pry for the best since they took a -1 to their attacks in daylight.

&amp;nbsp;

**AD&amp;D 1e - Kobold**

Before we begin… I would like to address a horrible slight that the Kobolds experienced in 1e, and I’m not talking about the fact that they look like weird dog/rat/reptile creatures. It’s that the 1e Monster Manual says: *It is possible that goblins are distantly related to kobolds.* Is there no end to the suffering the awesome kobold must endure? Anyway, here are the stats:

&gt; **Frequency:** Uncommon
&gt;
&gt; **No. Appearing:** 40-400
&gt;
&gt; **Armor Class:** 7
&gt;
&gt; **Move:** 6""
&gt;
&gt; **Hit Dice:** 1-4 hit points
&gt;
&gt; **% in Lair:** 40%
&gt;
&gt; **Treasure Type:** Individuals J, O, Q (x5) in lair
&gt;
&gt; **No. of Attacks:** 1
&gt;
&gt; **Damage/Attack:** 1-4 or by weapon
&gt;
&gt; **Special Attacks:** Nil
&gt;
&gt; **Special Defenses:** Nil
&gt;
&gt; **Magic resistance:** Nil
&gt;
&gt; **Intelligence:** Average (low)
&gt;
&gt; **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
&gt;
&gt; **Size:** S (3' tall)
&gt;
&gt; **Psionic Ability:** Nil
&gt;
&gt; **Attack/Defense modes:** Nil

So now we get a little more information on these little rat/dog things. The Kobold starts to get fleshed out a little more, but you have to hunt for some of the information. They are broken into tribes, and the powerful tribes rule with an iron hand and force the weaker tribes to work for them. Since they hate bright light, they are usually found in the deep dark forest or in underground lairs. They are little creatures filled with hate, and love to kill and torture.  It is made very clear that they hate gnomes. They will attack them on sight. Based on some of the sparse lore, they have been at war with the gnomes for a long time. 

The root cause of this hatred comes from a conflict between the Kobold god Kurtulmak and the Gnome god Garl Glittergold (*Deities &amp; Demigods, pg. 109-110*). There is a one line mentioning of Glittergold collapsing Kurtulmak’s cavern in his description. It’s a one line explanation that leaves a lot to be desired, but we know a kernel of the lore behind why they hate each other. So, if your party has a gnome in it, be prepared to be attacked.

Remember those 40-400 kobolds? That number per encounter hasn’t changed, but now we have them fleshed out a bit more. They have the option to wield a variety of weapons (a chart is given in the *AD&amp;D MM, pg. 57*) and will be led by a leader and his two guards. These three will have max hit points of 4, an AC of 6 and do 1-6 points of damage. 

If you are able to find their lair, we are talking 200-400 kobolds milling about with their 30-300 eggs - yes, kobolds are hatched like dragons... or lizards. Leading this mob of Kobolds is the Chieftain, who interestingly enough gets no stats in the Monster Manual, many more guards and a 65% chance that there will be pets/mounts there that will also fight, either 2-5 wild boars, or 1-4 giant weasels.

I know that many of you are thinking that one or two well placed fireballs could wipe out most of the threat and the rest would flee. You are probably right. We know that kobolds aren’t the smartest of creatures, but that doesn’t mean they are completely stupid and don’t know how to fight and survive. It is noted under the Kurtulmak description that he taught the kobolds the ways of mining, ambushing and looting.  I can envision roaming groups of kobolds, laying in wait for unsuspecting adventures, striking quick, then fleeing to regroup if the battle turns against them. This is widely popularized in *Tucker’s Kobolds*, a tale of brave Kobolds protecting their lair from high level adventurers to great effect.

Kobolds eventually become a playable race in 1989 thanks to Joseph Clay in *Dragon #141*. I have one last, final note about these 1e Kobolds… they can live up to 135 years. For such weak little guys, they sure do cling to life pretty hard.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;
&gt; **XP Value:** 7
&gt;
&gt; **Chiefs/Guards** 15

And the information on the kobold continues to get more developed.  The opening description of the kobold in 2e goes into some depth:

*“Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demi-human races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.*

*Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobolds’ fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.”*

I love it. The detail that was put into making them look and feel like little evil creatures is fantastic, and the last line starts to clearly state how badly a pack of kobolds can screw up your day. No longer should we view the kobold as a tiny little rodent that will run at the first sign of a fight (unless it’s a gnome of course), but an intelligent tribe of evil little monsters that shouldn’t be underestimated. Even if they look like they got their picture swapped for hideously deformed goblins.

The 2e *Monstrous Manual* goes into depth about combat for each monster and the kobold is no exception.  They now have guerrilla tactics available to them when they fight. Smartly, kobolds will attack at a distance whenever possible, as they can now use javelins and spears. When the kobolds have overwhelming numbers on an enemy, they will attack in waves. I would venture to say that over the years of fighting and the knowledge that kobolds are naturally wary of all spell casters, they would not group too tightly together when swarming a party.  I bet that they have learned that those pesky AoE spells hurt… a lot.

And we get even more detail on what happens when the party stumbles into the kobold lair.  Along with the same information we had in 1e, we get an approximate number of guards (5-20 or 5d4), improved stats for the chieftain and his guards (AC 5, HP 7 and increased damage to 1-8), and the possibility of shaman(s) being present, giving the tribe some basic spell casting at their disposal. Again, it’s not like a kobold with 4 HP is scary, but when there are 400 of them with their leader, his bodyguards and a couple Wild Boars… well, there is a certain quality in quantity.

We are also given a description of how kobolds love traps. This fits in perfectly with everything we have learned about the little rat… dog… things… They seem like the type of creature that would have you fall into a pit of spikes, and kick you while you're impaled.  The *Monstrous Manual* states that they like to set up pits, crossbows and mechanical traps.  To us, this gives the sense that the kobolds are more intelligent than their earlier brethren, as even simple mechanical traps require an average level intelligence. To add to the evil flavor of the kobold, they will even have murder holes close by to watch from and then they will pour flaming oil, shoot arrows or even drop poisonous insects on the victims of their traps.  Who the hell would think of dropping a tarantula on someone stuck in a pit, already skewered by a spike?

Kobolds, that’s who.

3e gives the kobold some buffs that, while not making them much of a threat when there are only 5-10, makes them much more interesting when you run into a band of 50 kobolds.  They now have an average of 4 HP instead of 2, and can each have a maximum of 8 if the DM so wishes.  That’s a pretty big increase for what amounts to fodder. I get that a party of five 4th levels character can still defeat them, but when they attack in large numbers, you better have those AoE spells ready.

The pesky little lizards also get a nice buff to their AC. An AC15 makes them harder to hit than in previous editions. Though, once you get past level 5 you’re probably only going to miss on a 1. The real threat is for lower level characters without magic weapons and limited spells, they will need to think out their tactics very carefully when they are being attacked by a warband of kobolds. If one character gets surrounded by 5 or 6 kobolds, it could result in death in just a round. 

We like the new organization breakdown; since the kobold are listed as 1st level warriors, the DM gets valuable information just glancing at the top of their stat block. No rummaging around stat blocks trying to figure out when you are supposed to use this creature. It’s a nice quality of life change, and one that all DMs appreciate. Our stats are also better starting to mirror how things are done in 5e, and makes altering monsters from past editions to 5e a lot easier. 

These little guys were released in the first *Monster Manual* and are still at war with the Gnomes. Interestingly, the Gnomes have a bit of text that states that they try to not kill their enemies… unless they are kobolds. Which is pretty rude seeing how it is the Gnomes’ fault for this hate anyways. Visually, our kobolds are looking more reptile like than a dog, which is a huge relief, but the *Monster Manual* makes mention that they speak Draconic like a yapping dog… when will this injustice ever end?

More of these guys were released in *Unearthed Arcana* (2004): the Aquatic, Arctic, Desert, Earth &amp; Jungle kobold with slight reflavoring and adjusted stats.

Our kobolds have grown into… minions! This means death the moment someone sneezes a bit too hard around them. While I know that that is a bit of an unfair characterization when they had several different versions of kobold, it still stands that the kobold really and truly is just a minion in any game. Very few kobolds are going to be much of a challenge unless you get 40 of them in a room together, and even then… one fireball and they all go poof. 

In the 4e *Monster Manual*, we only get but a small chunk of information, but now they resemble the dragons they now revere and worship, and if the dragon pays them enough attention, the dragon will lead these little cowards. They are sneaky and love their traps, and if they fail leading adventurers into a trap they will sneak up and attack them in huge numbers. In the *Monster Manual* they detail several different kobolds for your group of unfortunate adventurers to be ambushed by:

&amp;nbsp;

**Kobold Skirmisher**, *Level 1 Skirmisher* - 27 HP

A mean kobold built for close fighting with their Mob Attacks, +1 to attack rolls for each kobold adjacent to their target, and their ability to shift around their opponents allows them to move about the battlefield causing havoc. When the going gets too tough, they’ll run away through trap-leaden tunnels.

&amp;nbsp;

**Kobold Slinger**, *Level 1 Artillery* - 24 HP

Ranged attacks get deadly in the hands of these badasses. They have a Special Attack where they can launch specialized ammunition that can immobilize, inflict fire damage or cause a penalty to attack rolls. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Kobold Dragonshield**, *Level 2 Soldier* - 36 HP

The first kobold with a decent AC of 18 and a nice boost to their HP. They not only get Mob Attacks, but whenever their enemy shifts around them, they can immediately shift with their enemy. It’s pretty impressive for these little guys to be following you around the battlefield when all you want to do is get away. They also get resistance to a specific damage type based on the dragon they serve, i.e. blue dragon gives lightning resistance.

&amp;nbsp;

**Kobold Wyrmpriest**, *Level 3 Artillery (Leader)* - 36 HP

Our first kobold that can truly be feared with it’s magical attack, healing abilities and even a dragon breath attack. These guys are no joke, and they are happy to remind you of that when they shoot their breath attack that deals 1d10 + 3 of any type of damage that the dragon they revere is.

&amp;nbsp;

**Kobold Slyblade**, *Level 4 Lurker* - 42 HP

The final kobold in the Monster Manual, and he is certainly the last kobold you want to run into. When they have minion kobolds about, they can use their Sly Dodge to let a minion kobold take that damage for them. This kills the minion, but leaves the Slyblade free of damage, he then gets to go in and start delivering damage. Sneaky little dragon.

The 4e Kobolds are pretty awesome, and don’t forget that these guys may have a dragon as their leader, so once you’re done getting blasted by a kobold fire breath, you are already warmed up for the real thing.

&amp;nbsp;

**5e - Kobold**
&gt; Kobold  /  Small humanoid (kobold), lawful evil
&gt;
&gt; **Armor Class** 12  /  **Hit Points** 5 (2d6 - 2)  /  **Speed** 30 ft.
&gt;
&gt; **STR** 7 (-2) | **DEX** 15 (+2) | **CON** 9 (-1) | **INT** 8 (-1) | **WIS** 7 (-2) | **CHA** 8 (-1)
&gt;
&gt; **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 8  /  **Languages** Common, Draconic
&gt;
&gt; **Challenge** 1/8 (25 XP)
&gt;
&gt; **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
&gt;
&gt; **Pack Tactics.** The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
&gt;
&gt; **Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
&gt;
&gt; **Sling.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

So now we come to the latest incarnation of the mighty kobold. While it is very much like its predecessor, a small little weakling, it has several things that help it shine. Mostly its Pack Tactics ability that gives them a greater chance of hitting their targets. Though, they should stay out of the light as sunlight is not their friend.

The kobold’s lore now gets a major upgrade from previous versions. Kurtulmak is still their primary god, but it turns out good old Kurtulmak was actually a vassal of Tiamat. As the legend goes, the sneaky little gnome god Garl Glittergold managed to steal a small trinket from Tiamat’s hoard. Rightfully pissed off, Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the item from Garl Glittergold. While still vague, lore has it that Garl pulled a trick on poor Kurtulmark and trapped him underground for all eternity. Kobolds still worship their trapped god, with kobold zealots determined to find and release Kurtulmak from his underground prison. If that was ever to happen, I’d hate to be a gnome… which isn’t to say I’d ever like being a gnome in the first place.

Left out of the 5e stat block is the number of kobolds appearing. I know 5e doesn’t include that in the monster descriptions, but I do miss that from previous editions. What it does tell you is that kobolds have pack tactics and that is a huge advantage to the little dragons. If six kobolds are all around you, each one would get advantage. Add the fact that they get +4 to hit and suddenly you may have a problem. A dagger won’t do that much damage but six daggers will, especially if you are a lower level.

A nice addition to the kobolds, are the Winged Kobold. They are also known as Urds, and they have appeared as far back as 2e, but they are now given their own stats block and are described as distant relatives of the kobold. Plus, instead of being viewed as the sickly second cousins to the kobolds, they are now part of the mighty kobold race, and their wings are gifts from Tiamat herself.

The kobolds continue their conquests into 5e with Volo’s Guide to Monsters which gives players the ability to play as one, as well as giving information about the lairs of kobolds and just how tricky they can be with their traps. 

And that wraps up the kobold. The once dog/rat creatures compared to weak goblins are now standing on their own feet, or wings, as worshippers of dragons and fierce warriors… so long as you get them in a pack. Otherwise, they’ll run away behind some traps. 
",1,"Whether you see them as rat/dog hybrids or the majestic mini-dragons they truly are, the Kobold is the greatest mob minion to ever come out of the Monster Manual!"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,18,"*Below are the essentials of a more scholarly approach to 5e spellcasting, dubbed 'Arcane Tearing', documented as if from the perspective of an in-game character. It is meant as a way for DMs to introduce magic and its practice in a more scientific light within their world, as opposed to the usually more 'mysterious' approach. This is my take on how to present magic in such a way, and anyone who wants to use it in their game and worldbuilding is fully welcome to incorporate and alter it according to personal preference. Just let me know how it goes.*

I will revise and expand the system according to feedback and personal experience.

# An introduction to Arcane Tearing

***By Nedarm Stourge, Professor of Arcane Presence and Allocation***

***at Pyrestone University.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Casting magic is a process of enormous delicacy. Those who wield it will tell you otherwise, having been accustomed to its nature or born with innate talent, but the truth is that, due to its intuitive character, few have ever taken the trouble to truly try and understand the theory behind it. Of course, every wizard will deny that claim, holding up countless hours of practice and study as evidence, but even that is memorization of spells and sigils and does not touch upon what *happens* when they wave their arms.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the leading expert on arcane processes, I Nedarm Ferdrick Stourge, professor of Esoteric Presence and Allocation at Pyrestone University, have taken it upon me to put together a comprehensive guide to the magical process for the convenience of those unable to attend Pyrestone university or have a merely academic interest in the ways of our world.

&amp;#x200B;

This overview will detail the magical process, officially dubbed ‘Arcane Tearing’, of casting a spell. As is common in Pyrestone this also uses the Askei Ves-Tonder System which, unlike the older Tuhwal System utilized in the Arcane Circle Colleges, accounts for Esoteric drifting and the use of material components in Slotcasting.

The steps of Arcane tearing are listed below in the order of execution:

1. **Ves**The Ves is the most basic part of the spell and can be constructed intuitively by most creatures with even small amounts of practice. In simple terms, it is the process of creating a ‘tear’ in the esoteric plane through either verbal or somatic means and letting arcane energy into the material plane. Arcane energies in their purest form are nearly untraceable, much like light that shines on nothing, and need to be focused through the Lod to take shape. If not focussed, Arcane energies dissipate and return to the Esoteric plane. The creation of the Esoteric tear is done through the casters own energy and can only be done a certain number of times a day depending on the strength of the caster.The more experienced the caster, the bigger the tear, the more energy they can get out of it.
2. **Lod**The Lod, together with the Tonder, is probably the most understood element of spellcasting and only possible for those either practiced or born with arcane bloodlines.Expanding on the previous analogy this is the process of focussing the light in a certain way and giving it the properties required to be susceptible to more advanced control with the Tonder. The Lod is limited to eight Vectors, more commonly known as ‘Schools of Magic’, which are:
   1. *Abjuration*
   2. *Conjuration*
   3. *Divination*
   4. *Enchantment*
   5. *Evocation*
   6. *Illusion*
   7. *Necromancy*
   8. *Transmutation*
3. **Tonder**By far the most complex stage of Arcane tearing, the Tonder is what most people think of when it comes to spellcasting. The Ves and Lod can be spoken and drawn relatively quickly, while a complicated Tonder can take up to ten minutes to complete, utilizing Somatic-, Verbal- and sometimes even Material components, though this is only the case for a select few bindings.In Layman’s terms, the Tonder is a circle, usually drawn in the air and enhanced through sonic focus, that closes itself around the established Ves and Lod and shapes it into a binding, better known as a spell.Imagine, if you were to go cut down a tree (*Ves*) and then cut it into smaller, workable, pieces (*Lod*) you would still only have a pile of wood without a specific purpose. The Tonder is the equivalent of working the wood to make it usable, like shape a tool out of it or dry it for firewood.While the Ves and Tonder are bound by set limitations, the Tonder can be edited in a near-infinite number of ways, though only a ‘*pure’* fraction of that has true arcane potency.While sorcerers are limited by their power awakening slowly, a Wizard’s only limitation is their knowledge of Tonder coding and the size of the Ves Tear.
4. **Kortem**The Kortem is the release of the spell and the action of guiding it to affect a certain object, individual or location. While the Lod and Tonder do encompass the Ves, the Arcane energy in and of itself is still passive. The Kortem could be described as executing the code established with the Tonder and Lod. This does not require any somatic or verbal input, but rather is bound to the caster’s direct intent. For that reason, it is possible to delay the activation of the Lod and Tonder. Holding on to the binding until it is cast.

# Glossary

**Ves-Tonder System**

A method of indexing the spellcasting process into the Ves, Lod, Tonder and Kortem. It accounts for esoteric drifting and material components in slotcasting. Originally created in Askei as part of a wave of renewed interest in the magical arts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tuhwal System**

A method of indexing the spellcasting process into the Roots, Trunk, Branches and Leaves. It operates with the assumption that there is a limited amount of Branches to shape the spell.

Originally it was created by Archibol Tuhwal for teaching Arcane Tearing in Totem and later updated to differentiate between Granted, Innate, and Practiced arcane tearing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Arcane Tearing**

The process of taking energy from the Esoteric plane and shaping it into a binding.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bindings (Spells)**

Arcane energy shaped in a certain way to produce the desired effect. They are named as such because of the literal ‘binding’ of Arcane energy into a certain shape.

&amp;#x200B;

**Slotcasting**

The process of attempting Arcane Tearing through personal energy. Limited by the caster’s own strength.

&amp;#x200B;

**Slots**

A measurement of innate energy that can be utilized for Arcane Tearing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Levels**

A measurement of the energy needed to cast a certain binding. Higher levels will require more slots.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spellcasting Components**

Methods of shaping Arcane energy. Commonly categorized as Somatic (Physical Shaping), Verbal (Sonic Shaping) and Material (Comprised Shaping). Different Bindings will require different combinations of Components.

&amp;#x200B;

**Esoteric plane**

A theoretical plane of existence containing magical energy. Though it is presumed not to be a physical place that can be visited it overlays all known planes of existence.

&amp;#x200B;

**Esoteric tear**

A created connection between a physical plane of existence and the Esoteric plane. It serves the purpose of tapping into Arcane energy present in the Esoteric plane.

&amp;#x200B;

**Esoteric drift**

The movement of Arcane energy within the Esoteric plane. Though an Esoteric tear can be created in most places, the amount of energy present varies. Accounting for esoteric drift in creating bindings can result in stronger, more focused effects.

&amp;#x200B;

**Arcane Energy (Esoteric Dynamism)**

The energy present in the Esoteric plane. It is most commonly used for Arcane tearing to create bindings. In some locations, such as the Feywild, it is also present naturally and part of the ecosystem. The reasons for this are unknown. A number of creatures can tap into it intuitively to enhance their own ability or sometimes even as an essential part of their biological processes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive Arcane Energy (Passive Esoteric Dynamism)**

Arcane energy artificially brought out of the Esoteric plane without a purpose. It is nearly untraceable and useless unless shaped into a binding. If it remains untouched it will return to the Esoteric plane at sunrise (planar time).

&amp;#x200B;

**Arcane bloodlines**

The presence of blood or other genetic material of an innately magical creature in a normally non-magical creature. Usually, the cause for this is an ancestry that can be traced back to a union of a magical and non-magical creature or extended exposure to arcane forces compatible with the biological material with a non-magical creature.

The bloodline allows intuitive Arcane tearing, though often needs to be used extensively for the arcane genetic material to gain more dominance over the non-magical side and allow for stronger bindings.

The usually unnatural combination of Magical and non-magical biological material can lead to quirks in the Arcane Tearing known as ‘Wild magic’.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tonder Vectors/Trunks (Schools of Magic)**

Base shapes of Arcane Energy. They allow for the energy to be used in the crafting of more complex bindings. We differentiate between eight vectors (Source: [https://open5e.com/spellcasting/schools-of-magic.html](https://open5e.com/spellcasting/schools-of-magic.html)):

1. **Abjuration** bindings are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
2. **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
3. **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.
4. **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
5. **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
6. **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
7. **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
8. **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tonder/Branch coding**

The process of building upon the Trunk/Lod Vector to shape a certain binding. This is usually done through a combination of the Spellcasting components.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pure Tonder/Branch Code**

A Tonder/Branch code that produces a potent Arcane effect (binding). Documented bindings are usually the purest form of a certain binding. Less efficient (impure) code either produces a less potent version of the spell or no effect at all. Theoretically seen there is an infinite amount of pure Tonder codings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Granted Arcane Tearers (Vassals)**

Casters with no innate knowledge or practice concerning Arcane tearing. Their magic is granted by an External power in the form of executables. The spellcasting components are used to invoke the name or essence of the External power.

&amp;#x200B;

**External powers (Foreign Capacity)**

An ‘External power’ or ‘Foreign Capacity’ is a creature, deity or essence with the ability to grant magical ability to ‘Vassals’. Their nature is not entirely understood, but it is presumed that they operate largely out of symbiotic motives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Executables**

Pre-coded Arcane energy usable by anyone. They are either granted by External powers to Vassals or connected to physical object such as rings. It can be activated through a Kortem. Some executables can be used a number of times, while others disappear after activation. This method of ‘executables’ does not work for all Bindings however, while others seem impossible to replicate through traditional spellcasting.

&amp;#x200B;",1,[OC] Arcane Tearing: Creating a science behind Spellcasting in D&amp;D
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,7,"I've suddenly gotten a flash of inspiration for a world I want to build. 

Magical technology has evolved to a point slightly ahead of where we are now in human civilization. The world I'm thinking of has just begun exploring their solar system with interplanetary magical craft - they're exploiting resources, colonizing, fighting wars over planets, smuggling around the system, etc. However, back on the homeworld, how are things going?

Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree or the ideas in my head don't necessarily work, but the only think I can think to call this to give you a one-word example of what I'm thinking is ""carbonpunk.""

I've asked some friends in real life and their answer was that wild magic would probably be the most reasonable thing to go with, but that doesn't really scratch the itch I'm looking for. I'm willing to hamfist it if necessary with some techno-mystic babble or something, but a relatively reasonable explanation would be best.

What I've got so far:

Magic passing from the weave into the real world creates carbon monoxide and just straight carbon, causing thick black smoke to emanate from whatever is causing it. Generally, this is almost invisible whenever a person is doing individual casting. Maybe some more energy-producing spells make it more noticeable, but it almost isn't there when Sue casts Prestidigitation to warm up her coffee after it's been sitting a little too long.

Tl;dr: Magic makes smog-like pollution. Why?",1,What kind of pollution would widespread abuse of magic create?
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,71,612,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the process of world building for my upcoming high-fantasy campaign. Im my campaign, there is no real states - world is divided by dozen or so city-states that loosely control territories around them. I want each city-state to have its own identity and idiosyncrasies.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I also want to stress that these city-states are functioning around few notions:

* populations of city-states are not racially homogeneous, but very diverse and each race feels at home
* most of the population has access to low level magic and magic is mundane and everyday thing (lets say every 10th citizen can do level 2 spells)
* each city-state has strengths and weaknesses that play a role in their geopolitics - and some interesting quirks

&amp;#x200B;

Now, obviously I can't have you guys do all my work for me, but I am interested to hear your opinions how magic would affect a standard large (25k + people) medieval town? Most of the states are feudal.

&amp;#x200B;

What jobs would wizards have?

What spells would be forbidden and how would magic be regulated?

What place in society would those who cannot cast have?

What training would warriors have knowing they might face mages? What tactics would they use?

How would shops and mundane professions look like?

How would travel, trade and defenses look like with teleport in mind?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are two examples of city-states I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Omenryh

&amp;#x200B;

A city in the mountains built upon hot springs. It is always shrouded in steam and mists. Omenryh has rich mines beneath it with two peculiar things.

It is the only city-state with access to adamantium - the hardest metal known. It takes 20 years to mine enough of it to forge a sword. It has nearly unlimited supplies with one complication.

Long time ago a tarrasque was moving under the mountains. This strong beast somehow got stuck between huge deposits of adamantium. It is stuck and helpless and people of Omenryh harvest it for meat.

&amp;#x200B;

So Omenryh has unlimited meat for its citizens and strongest metal (also best blacksmiths), but if it keeps mining that adamantium it might free the tarrasque.

&amp;#x200B;

Since Omenryh doesn't need as many citizen working in food-providing professions, how do they use that surplus? Do they have more warriors? More miners? How would everyday magic look in Omenryh?

&amp;#x200B;

**Laer**

&amp;#x200B;

A somewhat isolated city surrounded by supernatural forests. These forests have living trees, mists that keep you magically lost for decades and plants with incredible properties. City is know for few things:

It has access to portal magic and has few teleportation gates setup with few select city-states.

Almost everyone in this city-state has a familiar.

People have blue eyes due to their diet (praise Dune yall).

&amp;#x200B;

What conditions would other city-states have to fulfill to have portal gates in their town? Who would run them? Would other city-states have some cautionary measures?

How would citizens go about their daily life knowing they have familiars that need no food or maybe even rest? They would use them as messengers and sentry but what else?

How would Laer's defenses look like knowing that any large army attacking would likely get lost in forests?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I would like to see how you guys tackle this issue, it seems very broad and I could spend days working on it but I don't want to spend too much time on details players won't need and I really want some outside perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

The Pot, as the locals call it, is barely distinguishable as a tavern from the outside, marked only by its orange painted door. A tavern is a tavern, though, and drink and a hearty (even malodorous) broth will always be well recieved on a cold night.*

I spent some time putting together a nice iso map and some information for a cute little tavern that can be dropped into pretty much any D&amp;D fantasy setting. Let me know if you use it, I'd love to hear about it!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,22,311,"Money. It's the root of all evil, it may be exchanged for goods and services but it certainly can't buy happiness, and in the words of Pink Floyd, it's a gas. But in a game like Dungeons and Dragons, money can be both a problem and an opportunity. In this post, I'll talk about what money actually is within the confines of a role-playing game, some common pitfalls with the awarding and use of money, and how you can incorporate the accumulation and use of wealth into your game design.


# What is this green (or gold) stuff?


In the real world, money is an abstraction of resources. It can represent time, effort, and physical items, and has enabled humans to trade in highly complex ways. Real money is important because in the real world, resources are real and finite and have value to us and the people around us. It also forces us to make choices: most of us can't afford everything that we want, so we have to pick and choose and make sacrifices.


In D&amp;D, on the other hand, resources are much more fluid. Time can pass at the speed of the DM saying ""time passes..."", and effort is a nebulous thing that is not really felt by the players. There isn't really any point in buying more or better food than you need to stay alive because you don't taste that food. A D&amp;D character who never picked up any money would probably be just fine. And anything that you could buy with money, a DM could simply award, or have lying on the ground in a dungeon. RPG money is starkly different as compared to money in real life.


So what is money in an RPG? Simply put, money is a player's power of choice. A player with no money that relies on DM handouts has very little control over what items and equipment they acquire, and a player with infinite money can purchase all their options without making any sacrifices whatsoever. The more money a player has, the more control they have over their character's abilities, from purchasing stronger weapons to hiring mercenary companies to owning airships. The money a character has is a measurement of their control over their destiny, at least as far as equipment advancement is concerned.


# Mo money, mo problems


One of the most frequent complaints in D&amp;D, particularly in 5^th edition, is that players tend to be strapped for cash for the first few levels, and after that never have to worry about money again. This tends to happen shortly after the players accumulate enough cash for plate armour, the only real big ticket item in the PHB. And when you already have everything that money can buy, suddenly all that money loses its value, because it can no longer be used to control your advancement. Instead, players are forced to wait and hope that the +2 magic weapon they find in the next dungeon happens to be an axe or warhammer or whatever else their weapon of choice happens to be. Yes, players can talk to their DM to tell them what items they'd like to find, but the ""progress bar"" of saving money and anticipating a purchase is much more satisfying.


The flip side of this problem is when DMs don't award enough money for players to afford anything. This is much less common, but tends to occur when a DM looks to deliver a ""gritty"" experience. The problem here is obvious: players can't control their advancement at all, and thus lose an important aspect of choice in their advancement.


Why is this choice so important? Because it increases engagement with the world of the game and makes you feel more invested in the character if it is your choices that have driven their development. Imagine a video game where you randomly got random upgrades with no way to influence what you would get. Would that feel satisfying? Probably not. That's why most RPG video games offer an array of different choices to make, all of which are desirable with none being clearly the best, and let you decide which one you want most. As DMs, we should take that lesson to heart.


# Putting it into practice


There are a lot of good ways to address this problem. Here's mine:

1. In your Session Zero, talk to each of the players about their dream things to own in the game. You can give them examples to get them started - upgraded weapons, castles, airships, animals, armies, anything. Note down any items they mention that you can see yourself including in the game.
2. Decide the highest level at the end of the campaign (eg. This campaign will end approximately as characters achieve 13^th level). Divide the levels of the campaign into rough power levels, and split the items on the list fairly evenly into those power levels.
3. Total the whole cost for everything the party could ever want within a power level, and then cut it down - by a half if you want the players to have a lot of stuff, by a quarter if you want them to really work for it, by a third for a solid experience. Put that amount in a ""pot"" for each power level. Make sure that the total amount of money left in each is enough to buy the most expensive item on the list - if it isn't, then you may want to either remove that item or treat it as a quest item in the next step.
4. List any ""gate"" items for your campaign by power level (items that are absolutely necessary to progress and that the acquisition of which will be a party goal). For example, in a campaign that requires the party to sail to a distant island in the lowest power level, chartering a ship or crew is a gate item. Total those costs and add them to the pots for each power level.
5. The amount of money in each of those pots is the maximum money obtainable during that power level. Divide it as you see fit between hoards, hidden rooms, the pockets of that kobold tribe, wherever. If they players look absolutely everywhere and find everything, that's how much money they should end up with.
6. Make the items available for purchase early in the power level, so that they know what they're saving up for. However, make sure that gate items are broadcasted early as well and shown to be obviously necessary, so that players don't go broke on the optional stuff.

The key here is that the players should never be able to afford everything they want, but they should be able to afford any single part of it that they want or more. This forces them to make tough choices, which helps them be much more invested in their character. There are a lot of ways to achieve this, so don't take what I've written as gospel; play with it however you like and make it work for you. Enjoy!",1,"Money - What it is, why it sucks, and how to use it better"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,45,"Becoming a DM can be really scary. As the DM you are in charge of a world, organizing games, planning a story, creating characters, judging rules, and all sorts of things that can be really intimidating for someone who has never done it. Today I want to share the stories of my fellow DM's, and how they got into D&amp;D and DMing. I want to show people that it is ok to make mistakes and give people the push they need to become DM's themselves. I asked the Gollicking for their stories and this is what we ended up with. 

**/u/TuesdayTastic**

I first discovered D&amp;D in the library. I was browsing the sections when I came across a dark blue book with a world on it. I checked it out and started reading the 3.5 Dungeon Master's Guide. This book was revolutionary to me and taught me that not only can you create your own worlds, but you can play games in them. I barely understood the book, as I needed the Player's Handbook to go along with it, but the seed of roleplaying was instilled in me.

A few years later I went back to that same section of the library and found the Core Rulebook for Pathfinder. All of my memories of the DMG flooded back to me and the book finally made sense to me. I quickly gathered all of my friends and started a game. We stumbled through the rules and had to make several new rulings on the spot (most of them wildly imbalanced) but we had so much fun it didn't even matter. 5 years later, and I still do my best to DM as much as possible. Nothing compares to how rewarding it is when you can get the entire table to cheer in excitement.

**/u/Mimirion**

I found this game online in which people could do whatever, which weirdly was an attractive quality for me at that time simply because I played some PC game and was annoyed with the invisible walls and the lack of clever strategies that could be applied. So I did my research, found there were half a dozen options, went for Pathfinder because of the clear ruleset and character customization options. Bought the books on a whim. Searched for people that wanted to try. Got my first game behind the screen.

Went all out for the first session. Designed the first part of my own world for it, because I didn't want to spend more than I already did (didn't even start in a tavern btw., was equally bad though). Drew a map (on tea-ed paper with burned edges and everything), devised some clever obstacles and ran that session with surprising success. Was all downhill from there, but never stopped having fun and throwing my players for a loop.

**/u/Foofieboo**

My adventure began out in the wilderness. No, like literally, we were camping out in the wilderness. The first time I experienced DnD (ad&amp;d 2e) I clutched my character sheet tight in my grip as I sat on the edge of a seat I fashioned out of an unsplit log of firewood. I was playing a cleric, who only knew one spell (heat metal) because in 2e you had to find somebody to teach you spells and that was the only one I found so far. Determined to prove my worth, my group ran into a treant near a lake, I yelled to my brother at arms to douse the monstrosity with lantern oil. Then, on my turn, I heaved my grappling hook into the oil and cast my spell. Ignited, we quelled the threat and slayed the beast. My glory was short-lived as soon after I was slain; my face ripped to shred as I got entangled in rusty chains fleeing a wyvern. That first adventure entangled me in the world of DnD. It was 1994, my dad was driving our suburban to another weekend campout for Boy Scouts and I had 4 friends in the back. We folded down the seats so we could all face each other with a flat surface in the middle. We had agreed to each get a different book in the set. We had a player's handbook, an ultimate thieves guide and I had a DMG. As the holder of the DMG, I was elected to DM so I flipped to the 2e table for npc personality, rolled up the general storekeeper they wanted to buy equipment from and the rest is history.

**/u/InfinityCircuit**

Why I became a DM

It all started back in 1997. I'd been playing D&amp;D, basic rules, then AD&amp;D 1e, for a few years by then. Id never DMed though, and my grasp on the rules was tenuous at best. My neighbor and several friends in the neighborhood wanted to play, and they brought me a fuckton of dice, mostly d6s, to start our game. Sitting in my next door neighbor's bedroom, going through the AD&amp;D 2E DM's guide, trying to figure out how to play, I started with a terrible, homebrewed d6 test system. My friends played a wizard, a dwarf fighter, and a human rogue. They fought a lamia and killed it by pinning it to the ground and chopping its head off. In mechanical terms, it failed against all their rolls, and it was just basically me making shit up and telling the story. As the one kid that had read Lovecraft, Burroughs, Doyle, and Tolkien, I was the natural choice to build the world and describe the adventure.

We may as well have been playing a diceless game, at first. As long as they had fun, I didn't care. I eventually bought every Forgotten Realms splatbook, Monster Compendium, and sourcebook that I could with my job money and allowance. I became the one friend everyone knew that could run games from memory. Everyone wanted to play, but nobody knew the rules or cared. They all wanted to play “Yermomsuhoe the Elf Ranger”, or “Frank The Barbarian.” Murderhobo-ing was the game, and D&amp;D was its name.

But we were young, and it was better than drinking, smoking pot, or dealing methcathinone. We were free within our imaginations, and it made all the troubles of being young and poor just fall away.

**/u/PantherophisNiger**

I always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons, but my religious parents would never have allowed it. In college, my boyfriend invited me to join a 4e game he was starting up. During the summers, we would all meet at his parents' house play for several hours (literally in the basement). My husband and I went to Gencon 2014 for our honeymoon. 5e was being debuted there. We got nostalgic for our old college group, but my husband absolutely did NOT want to DM. I agreed to sit in the DM chair, so we picked up the Dungeon Master's Guide, the Player's Handbook and Hoard of the Dragon Queen. Our 5e group has had several player rotations, but we have met nearly every week since 5e was officially released (except for ~4 weeks, following the birth of my son). I'm currently a #ForeverDM, and I don't really mind it. I love running the show and planning the adventure for my best friends.

**/u/RexiconJesse**

A year after playing my first tabletop RPG (Deadlands), I couldn't stop thinking about all of the possibilities ttrpgs could offer. I had only played video games, and the range of possibilities ttrpgs offered blew my mind. I thought about how great a zombie apocalypse rpg could be. You could craft makeshift weapons, use creative tactics to get out of situations, and have that constant dread of the undead hordes. The ideas didn't stop, and I started writing them down. I teamed up with a friend and made an RPG to best fit the ideas we thought we be the most fun to use. I ran that campaign for 2 years. I wasn't sure I wanted to GM, I just knew I wanted to make that game. And who else would run a game I made? But as I got over my fears of GMing, I learned how fun it was. I wanted to run more games, and I wanted to make more content. And I haven't stopped since.

**/u/Fortuan**

I became a DM simply because I wanted to play. My parents had played in their high school days and even now do so once every few months (which I DM'd the last session of that) so the books always sat on the mantle at our first house. I loved looking at the Monster Manual (AD&amp;D 1E) with my dad and learning about the monsters. The Bullet, Beholder, and Purple Worm being my favorites. However, like most US families both parents were busy a lot so we never got to play just look at the books. I was on a vacation at my Grandmother's in Georgia when I found a used Red Box kit for AD&amp;D for 10$. I bought it with the little money I had as a 13 year old and that night starting reading the book front to back and did the little adventure in the book on my own. I wanted to play but everyone was too busy so it was just my brother and myself the first few times. I DM'd because I read the books. So I asked if my friends could come over on a Friday and I ran my first campaign with the mesh of books we had. 2E PHB, 1E MM, and DM's guide and custom made character sheets my Dad made on the computer for us. After it went so well my parents decided we could have people over every Friday and that continued till I moved out after college. Eventually, I wasn't the only DM my brother and some other friends learned and we switched around. Since then I've come to learn I much rather be a player than a DM but I do LOVE world building and figuring out Monster Behavior. I would say the best thing that came out of all of it though is one friend who thanked me for running it all those years since it gave him something to do other than to party on weekends. I don't know how much of it was him being sentimental but I liked the idea that I someone helped someone.

**/u/OrkishBlade**

Two of my best friend's were brothers. One was a year ahead of me, the other a year behind me in school. They had an older brother who is ~10 years older than all of us. He lived in the basement. Not only was he my first DM, he was a literal cellar-dweller.

After 2-3 sessions, I hacked out a simple ruleset using only 6-sided dice to play with my younger siblings and some of the neighborhood kids. They were all younger. It was around the time 3E was released, so I picked up the new rulebooks and we never looked back.

But back to the cellar-dweller... my first character was a half-elf rogue named Talon. The first piece of treasure that I picked up was a jagged, poorly-made shortsword that I looted from a dead orc. The cellar-dweller ran a DMPC kender who just fucked everything up, alerted Strahd we were sneaking around the grounds of Castle Ravenloft, and Talon got himself blood-drained.

**/u/M0rdenkainen**

It all began when my parents took me out of the Lutheran school I grew up in and sent their plump, sensitive idiot boy into the wolves' den of public middle school in the mid-90s. Okay, the late 90s. I forget why, but rather than taking the bus home, I ended up following one of my few friends (of similar constitution) on a bus that dropped off near the public library. In the basement of the children's wing, one of the librarians' son invited me into a haphazard but still weekly game of AD&amp;D, 2nd Edition. I played a thief named The Flying Baccarat before I knew what Baccarat was. After sufficiently mocked by older nerds who grew up playing card games with their parents, he became the Flying Mandoo, former circus acrobat and not at all total Robin ripoff. His adventure was into nothing less than the Nine Hells themselves and his misadventures with a magical golden coin invented by a DM who just read about King Midas in school left him with a permanently, uselessly gold hand. Good for thumping people about the head, I guess. The DM, who would go on to work for the NSA after having gotten a PhD in mathematics (on purpose, weirdly) did his very best, but in all my pubescent arrogance I found only frustration in that library basement. He was terrible at improvising. He didn't do the voices. The sessions were WAY too short. On and on my complaints went, first with him, then with everyone after. Oh, not to their face, no. I was doughy and weak and didn't enjoy confrontation. But eventually, I learned a lesson I find myself re-learning every few years or so: I'm the only DM I like. So now, I DM pretty exclusively, unless I've once again mistakenly convinced myself to let someone else behind the screen and inevitably find myself counting the sessions until it's my campaign again. (I promise I'm not as terrible of a player as you would be justified believing.)

**/u/FamousHippopotamus**

I played D&amp;D for 12 years before I became a DM in 1990. I hadn't played for a few years, and my friend mentioned wanting to play, so we did a short little thing and while it was fun, my friend didn't feel comfortable DMing, so I volunteered. I asked about where they wanted to play, and they said ""CITY!"" - so now you know why I'm obsessed with them, as I had to draw the damn thing, populate it, and we spent nearly a year there. This was in 2e. I was pretty terrible. I've told this story before, but my first group literally flipped a table over on me due to my extreme railroading, power-mongering, and general asshole-ishness. Totally fair call. I was all those things. And I wised up, got better *real fast* and vowed to never stop learning. I'd like to think that I haven't. I've had maybe 150 players over the years, some great, some bad, some forgettable, and it's the deaths I remember the most - the amazing ones, the silly ones, the sacrificial ones, the random ones. I play this game because I want to know what happens (I don't write plot), and I like feeling the mystery unfold before me. When you are at the table, and the synergy is sparking, and everyone is dialed-in, you cannot beat it. *Magic.*

_____
**Adventure Teaser - To Bring Peace to a People**

The final forthcoming part of this module is an adventure similar to the final part of my previous Gang of Thieves module. The following is a summary of the planned adventure using these creatures and side-quests.

**Setup**

One of the tribes wants to unite the other four under a single leader, returning them to how they were in the distant past and ending centuries of near ceaseless war between them. However, diplomacy can only get them so far. Honor demands that a tribe’s leader and their personal clan does not surrender without a fight so a peaceful confederation is practically impossible. 

Sometimes the party is directed in side-quests by the political direction of the visionary leader. Other times, the leader is transmitting direction without a full understanding from the spirits of their ancestors who maintain a watchful and advisory role. These spiritual advisers directed the visionary leader to the party as a group or individually, leading to their recruitment.

**Events**

In event 1, the party saves the tribe that recruited them from being conquered by the final tribe to be defeated by the party in event 4. 

Event 2 is the conquest of the first tribe after performing 2 side-quests to weaken them or gain the strength for attacking them.

Event 3 is conquest of the second tribe on behalf of the third tribe who will confederate without a fight if the party helps them conquer their hated enemy. The party must first complete two side-quests for the third tribe to gain their trust before going to war. A two-for-one and the only time a tribe will peacefully confederate. 

Event 4 is the conquest of the final tribe that the party fought against in event 1, after completing two side quests to prepare for the final assault. The fourth tribe may have recruits from the confederated tribe who disavowed their place due to the perceived dishonor of integrating without a fight.

Each of these conquest events will differ in environment and objectives based on the particular tribe. The adventure will contain a conquest mini-adventure for each of the five tribes so that the DM and players can decide which one to raise as master of the others.

Let’s talk about oracles. There comes a time in every DM’s career when their players have overlooked every vital plot hook, and are meandering about town spending hours interrogating the local smith for clues he doesn’t know. Cue, the oracle. Whispered in timid shadows, legends of their mystical divination spread in hushed tones. Typically, when thinking of an oracle, a Romani-like woman is often pictured, dealing worn tarot cards in a colourful yet eerie tent while beads dangle gently rom her forlorn face. I’d like to take a look at a few varying oracles in fiction and otherwise, to offer some more colourful options for when you find yourself in need of a soothsayer extraordinaire.

With the following guide you should be able to construct an interesting, memorable and unique oracle rather than the typical old woman with a set of tarot cards. *(NOTE: There is nothing wrong with a typical Romani oracle, I just wanted to explore the other possibilities so that I had more flexibility when adding one to my world!)*

# Archetypes

&amp;#x200B;

**The Child**

The child prophet is a great trope to use when your story needs a somewhat unsettling feel. A child who possesses vast knowledge of the future, has the intelligent mind of an adult and is seldom seen actually acting like a child breeds a wonderful air of ‘strangeness’. The child could appear distinct in nature, bald head perhaps, always speaks with a smile. However you portray the child prophet, I feel it is important to capture the feeling of ‘this child has lived far longer than anyone’ to really drive home the disparate between a youthful mind and the burden of future.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ordinary Oracle**

The ordinary oracle, seen in *The Matrix* is generally a fun oracle to play. This oracle is generally one that does not speak with riddles or cryptic language, instead offering straightforward advice or indeed knowledge of the future. The ordinary oracle generally keeps their abilities to themselves; keeping an ordinary life with a day job and a family is a great way to hide such an ability from those who would wish to abuse it. As such, visiting this seer for a divination would be a difficult task; one would need to know the right people to ‘book an appointment’ so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Broken Mind**

The broken mind oracle; aptly visited in the film *300,* in Ancient Greek history, and even in the film *Donnie Darko.* This type of seer is described as having a direct channel to the divine, perhaps literally hearing the voice of god, or instead being in such an addled state to believe so. This type of seer will commonly have interpreters and devotees who will translate the incoherent babble into tangible advice and knowledge of the future. Personally, I use this oracle trope in my world, but he has no real ties to the divine, instead being a literal insane person who has garnered a following. However, you implement this archetype, be sure to allude to the fact that this individuals mind has indeed been fractured by the sheer weight of peering through time. As in *Donnie Darko*, this trope could be portrayed by an old person who has entirely lost their mind, but if approached may whisper some esoteric knowledge about the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Calculator**

This archetype is less based in divinity, and best seen in the film *Chronicles of Riddick*. This oracle is an expert mathematician, and can calculate the odds of events based on very few details. They may then choose to give the most likely outcome as divined truth. The calculator often falls into positions of political or military advisor, offering the likelihood of success or announcing the most statistically favourable battle plans. The calculator is often highly intelligent, successful, and tactful, sometimes hiding under the guise of a divine oracle, or being forthright in the nature of their divinations.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Siblings**

Sometimes malicious in nature, sometimes just tricksy, the siblings are an oracle trope seen in *MacBeth,* or in general European mythos. The siblings, often sisters and often in threes, are witch-like in nature, and display traits of an intertwined soul. Each member of the Siblings boasts varying personalities, but ultimately serve the same purpose, and divulge information with the same level of mystery. The siblings are often best portrayed as each finishing each other’s sentences, enjoying using their magic to mess with folks, and most commonly asking for penance of some kind in return for a fortune told.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Creature**

The creature is a deceptive oracle to put into your world. I have no examples off hand for this, but I’m sure it’s been done in abundance. Pick your favourite, semi-intelligent foe from the Monster Manual. Now it’s an oracle. This can be anything from a skittish goblin revered within his tribe, to an isolated gorgon, happy to read the fortune of any brave enough to give her company. Often, I find this oracle is good for a bit of comic relief; picking typically unintelligent monsters as candidates works best, such as trolls, ogres or kobolds. Inversely, feel free to choose something incredibly menacing, such as a dragon or a beholder. Additionally, the creature can be worked to fit any of the other oracle archetypes; nothing is set in stone here (besides the gorgons’ patrons).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ageless One**

This prophet is generally a powerful one, obtaining foresight merely by living long enough to see the patterns of society and life repeat. This trope is seen in *Dr. Who* as the Face of Bo. The ageless one can be almost interchanged with any other powerful being; one does not simply live for eons without being somewhat powerful. The ageless one is often great when you need an oracle that can deliver potent information about both the future **and** the past. The ageless one is often well established in the world, having significant purchase among other powerful beings; mere simple folk would be hard pressed to find an audience with such a character. The ageless one is best role-played as if they are from a different era; this could be in speech patterns or vocabulary unfamiliar; or speaking of people and places which seem to have never existed.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Romani**

Not that this one needs much covering, but we should still touch base on one of the most common oracle archetypes. The Romani archetype can be found in hero myth all over, but if you need a specific example, *Eragon* is a good one. Now, the Romani is often a witch or some other proprietor of mysterious magic. Perhaps they are part of a travelling circus, or a nomadic tribe of merchant caravaners. The Romani employs the use of cards, bones, scrying orbs and palms to read the fortunes of their customers. Many are clad in markings, tattoos, beads, cloth and all manner of vibrant garb. One should not shy away from using this trope as a simple con-artist either, a trope fit for the Romani stereotype.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Wanderer**

The Wanderer is similar to the Ageless One, in that they appear esoteric and mysterious, often appearing out of nowhere, and disappearing just the same. The wanderer will often not even use a particular oracle method, instead seeming to house the knowledge innately. The Wanderer might indeed be a God or Demigod, come to test or help the protagonists. The wanderer might be a particularly exotic race, or wear alien garb. The stranger this individual seems, the closer they adhere to this archetype.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Shaman**

The shaman is often seen in tribes, naturally, or other simplistic modes of life. A good example might be the oracle from the wonderful film *Cloud Atlas.* The shaman is usually a stiff follower of ritual and rite; they may have been taught their skills from an elder, and told this is the only way to do things of this nature. They tend to be focused on long ceremonies, wearing elaborate clothing, perhaps ritualistic masks, dancing for hours, and ingesting substances or eating sacred foods. Only at the end of the long ritual will the Shaman reveal any gleaned information.

# Method

**Scrying**

Scrying is perhaps one of the most common forms of future-reading. It involves peering into a reflective surface, such as a mirror, pond, or glass ball, and literally seeing the future within. Generally, the surface is said to become cloudy once concentration is obtained. With this form of sooth saying, the oracle need not look at a particular future of an individual, instead viewing an overall timeline of a group of people, or of the world in general.

&amp;#x200B;

**Palm Reading**

Palm reading involves understanding the crease lines in the palms, and understanding what they mean for the future of the individual. Generally, the knowledge divined from this method is comparatively vague, dealing with things like the approximate time of death, wealth, and love in the individual’s life. As an added bit of flavour, have your palm reader wear gloves, so they may avoid the ‘prying hands’ so to speak, of fellow palm readers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tarot Cards**

Tarot Cards; the hallmark of the Romani oracle, are probably the most used method in DnD for fortune telling encounters. While I encourage trying some of the other methods to mix up the flavour of your world, sometimes you can’t go past a good old-fashioned card reading. A typical carrot deck can be imitated in game by a standard deck of cards, and generally the oracle has the patron shuffle the deck, and draw a specified number of cards of the top. Other times, the patron may pick cards at random from a pre-shuffled deck. Either way, the oracle divines truths from the upturned cards, and conveys those truths to the patron.

&amp;#x200B;

**Augury**

Augury is the process of reading bird flights to glean fortunes. An Augur may be a druid, directly in contact with the avian world. Perhaps they have pet birds to coax flocks, or even wild shape into a bird to join in on the fortune telling directly. Either way, Augury can sometimes be lengthy, waiting with the patron to view a significant murmur, or to spot a particular bird the Augur considers magical. Patterns in the murmur indicate events or prophecies involving the patron or party. A rising swell of sparrows may indicate coming wealth, whereas a violent, outward facing vortex may indicate the chaos of death soon approaching.

&amp;#x200B;

**Entrail Reading**

Witches and occult oracles tend to be in favour of entail reading. This practice, due to its barbaric nature, fits in well with barbarian clans, perhaps among superstitious orc families, or dark magic witches. Entrail reading involves the sacrifice of an animal or humanoid, allowing its innards to spill out onto a Dias, upon which the arrangement of the intestines and stomach are used to divine the future. This practice is usually accompanied by an extravagant ceremony or ritual, paying penance to a pagan god or abyssal demon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bone Reading**

Bone reading involves the tossing of bones, generally knuckles, from either an animal or human. This practice is another one often done by the Romani, and involves the sole interpretation of the oracle to convey the message to the patron. Bone reading oracles may have the individual blow on the bones or toss them themselves. Like Tarot cards, this can be imitated in game by tossing dice, and having particular sets of numbers indicative of certain fortunes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tea Leaves**

Tea leaves involves the individual drinking a cup of tea, and leaving the leaves in the base of the cup for the oracle to read. Generally, symbols or omens will be extrapolated from the loose imagery in the leaves, which the oracle then translates into a tangible reading for the individual. Tea reading can be used as a great oracle method in oriental settings, or just as well in high magic settings. A good example of this method in fiction is in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Astrology**

Astrology is another well-known one, telling the future or prophecy of an individual by either studying the nature and movements of the heavens, or extracting prophecies from their birthdate. This method is generally applicable to pretty much all the archetypes; anyone can look up at the sky. Astrology readings need not always happen at night either, some oracles will use the shadow cast by an individual onto a map of the night sky to get ‘more accurate’ readings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spirituality**

Through the practice of devoted meditation, or self-discovery, spiritualists glean temporal knowledge through the opening of their third eye, allowing the torrent of time to pour into their consciousness and filling them with insight. Often monks or religious people, spiritual seers are among the most devoted of their kin, spending hours honing the practice and fortifying their mind to receive the information of the future. This method of scrying is an open one, interpret the divination as you will.

&amp;#x200B;

**Visions**

One need not even be an actual oracle to experience this method. Nonetheless, a vision oracle or seer is generally someone who has visions thrust upon them, rather than invoking it themselves. Perhaps the oracle is tormented by visions of the future, and has become maddened by the battering of a prophecy? Visions are a good catch all to reveal omens, prophecies and fortunes to the patron.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hallucinogens**

The use of a psychoactive substance to soothsay is one of the more fun methods to role-play. An oracle who uses hallucinogens to induce a quasi-spiritual state are often either extremely eccentric, or hold monk-like reserve. Whether the oracle themselves ingest the substance, or the patron does, the outcome will remain the same. The Oracle will be the conduit for interpretation as either one experiences otherworldly hallucinations and visions. For an added bit of fun, have the player roll for a short term madness effect after the substances have worn off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fire Staring**

Unlike most other methods of soothsaying, fire staring reveals the future to the individual in question rather than the oracle. The Oracle instead acts as a guide, preparing the correct wood and locale for the fire itself. Generally, fiery imagery will reveal itself to the viewer while the oracle chants, or keeps the fire stoked.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,91,"*You become aware of the sound of cheerful whistling growing closer. The source of the sound turns out to be a man made of white-painted steel strolling idly through the area. He's inscribed with writing in Common in an over-wrought script which declares him to be ""the Incredible Ice Cream Scooping Man"". His chest is large and boxy, and appears to have a handle on it. He has three flexible arms attached to a ring that that is rotating slowly; one arm ends in a scoop, the second has a hand, and the third appears to have a hole at its wrist.*

The man is a warforged who cannot speak, but the most important information on his ice cream (except for the magical effects of his products) is written on his body, and he will gesture to it if prompted. He was created by a wizard to peddle ice cream, a culinary creation of the wizard's own devising, but when he was sent into the world the wizard forgot to specify a range, so the warforged has wandered much farther than expected. He has been ordered to return to the wizard when his ice cream runs out.

His chest is a freezer box containing three flavors of ice cream. A coin slot in one shoulder is labeled ""1 Gold Piece""; if a gold coin is inserted, the warforged will use his hand to open his chest and indicate that the buyer should select one of the varieties (white, brown, or pink) contained in it. When a selection has been made, he will dispense an ice-cream cone from the arm with a hole and use his scoop to serve the requested flavor. The tips of the fingers in his hand can be opened to dispense sprinkles, fudge, or other common toppings upon request.

A character can eat a total number of scoops equal to half their constitution modifier (rounded up) before getting brain freeze, after which additional scoops will confer no further bonus and incapacitate the character for one round.

The pink flavor is strawberry, and a character who eats it gains 5 temporary hit points. Additional scoops of strawberry provide 3 more temporary hit points each, which can stack. The effect expires upon the character's next long rest or after 24 hours.

The brown flavor is chocolate, and a character who eats it gains resistance to the next nonmagical piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage they receive. Additional scoops provide resistance to one more attack each. The effect expires upon the character's next long rest or after 24 hours.

The white flavor is coconut, and a character who eats it gains the ability to breathe frost in a 15 ft. cone as an action a single time, forcing creatures in the cone to make a dexterity save. The DC for this attack equals 8 + the character's constitution modifier. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Additional scoops allow the character to make one more breath attack each. The ability expires upon the character's next rest or after 24 hours.

Hey guys, I tried this out with my group last night and they got a kick out of it and thought I should post it.

Basically as a DM, trying to speak for monsters, I could never come up with decent ""gibberish"" for the goblins, orcs, etc. to be saying. I wanted to make something that would fix my problem, and work quickly.

So here it is. Feel free to save as and make any changes you want. Simply input the phrase in common and what language you want and the 3rd cell will be the translation.

The second sheet has the simple excel code I used to accomplish this

Basically, I assigned each language a number and then to ""translate"" I had excel shift each letter back that number of letters in the alphabet (keeping vowels as vowels and consonants as consonants, I also changed Q's to Y's because they caused some issues)

I hope it helps someone! and all I ask is if you find something cool to add to it or something, post it on here so we can all use it!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,43,88,"Hi All,

As part of our continuing theme months, April is a month of Dungeons. The schedule is in the sidebar, but I will recreate it here:

Date|Event|Premise
:--|:--|:--
1st|Dungeon Theme|Come up with a dungeon theme
4th|Dungeon History|Design your dungeon's history
11th|Dungeon Rooms|Design your dungeon's rooms
15th|Dungeon Monsters|Design your dungeon's monsters
19th|Dungeon Obstacles|Design your dungeon's obstacles
25th|Dungeon Treasure|Design your dungeon's treasure
29th|Dungeon Release!|Release your dungeon to the sub!

There are also 2 AMAs scheduled this month - on the 8th and 22nd, so tune in for those. 

---

Here's how this is going to work. Event-by-event, you can join in and create a dungeon from scratch and then release it to the subreddit at the end if the month for everyone to use. We will compile them all (and even put them into a pdf if you ask nicely) and maybe some kind citizens will volunteer to do some artwork?

Anyway, today's event is:

# Dungeon Theme

**NOTE**: A ""dungeon"" is *any* self-contained location adventure. It doesn't have to be a literal dungeon!

* What is the theme of your dungeon going to be? What's the ""blurb"" you would write to entice someone to pick up your dungeon and give it a try?

* Please, only one entry per comment, but you can submit more than one theme (if you are willing to build more than one dungeon!)

Thanks everyone, and see you in the catacombs!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,330,"I was unsatisfied with the mob battles in DMG due to the simplicity of the calculation, and at the same time didn't want to deal with rolling 40  dice per side to deal with mobs, or going through the massive rules on army battles to just deal with groups of 10 to 100 enemies.

So I wrote a small bit of software to help with this issue in the following way:

You create the mob by providing its stats (it's assuming the mob is made up with multiple enemies of the same type). Once that's done the system gives you two options. First is to attack with the mob as a whole. You do this by rolling an attack roll once for the whole mob and entering the value. The system then creates a roll for each person of the mob. The average of all the rolls in the list or rolls must equal the roll you entered. When you attack, it asks for the AC of the target of the attack, using that to calculate the number of hits, and the damage of those hits

It also permits you to damage the mob as a whole. It takes the damage you do to it and attacks the first member of the mob and carries over the damage to the next creature if you mange to kill one of them.

It's a python app, so just run it from the command line in python 3. I've used only native libraries so you shouldn't need to add anything to get it to run. [https://github.com/food-always-food/DnD-Mob-Battles](https://github.com/food-always-food/DnD-Mob-Battles)

Category: trinkets/items

Weight: 1

   The Charm Bracelet (also known as the Bracelet of Lucky Charms) has 1d6 small charms on it with a thin metal link connecting the charm to the bracelet. Using an action to pluck one off and throw it will use up that particular charm, which then dissolves into sparkles of light as the effect/summon goes off. The most common charms are as follows:

1) hooded lantern.

2) 60' rope with grapnel.

3) towel, large and fluffy.

4) large skunk

5) ten foot pole

6) ten foot ladder

7) large shovel

8) empty large sack, burlap

9) tent, four-man

10) very large cauldron

11) large anvil

12) beehive with 10d10 normal bees 

All items are permanent after having been summoned/conjured.

LORE: It is believed that the first Charm Bracelet was created by the same individual who created the Robe of Useful Items and for the same purposes.

# ROD OF MASCULINITY

*unique/legendary*, attunement

This rod of bluesteel is treated as a mace +3. If it comes into contact with the Distaff, both will apparently explode in a 12d6 fireball centered on the point of contact. They will reform in random locations in 101 years.

The Rod has several effects relating to its Yang alignment after attunement. Over the period of one week, (Constitution Save to negate, recheck weekly for avoided effects) the following will occur (in order) to the wielder:

 Facial hair will begin developing after three days.

 Increase in body hair will begin developing after five days.

 Height increase of 1d6 inches will occur after six days.

 Weight increase of 1d6x10 pounds will occur at the same time as the height increase.

 If wielder is female or of no gender, wielder becomes male.

 \+1 Strength up to 20 if Strength is 9 or better. If Strength is below 9, Strength is +2.

The Rod of Masculinity has 1d4 charges (recharging at dawn) where expending a charge has one of the following effects by touch: Bull's Strength, Knock, or Shatter. 

&amp;#x200B;

# DISTAFF

*unique/legendary*, attunement

This staff is of white wood banded with light red metal and is treated as a Quarterstaff +3. If it comes into contact with the Rod of Masculinity, both will apparently explode in a 12d6 fireball centered on the point of contact. They will reform in random locations in 101 years.

The Staff has several effects relating to its Yin alignment after attunement. Over the period of one week, (Constitution Save to negate, recheck weekly for avoided effects) the following will occur (in order) to the wielder:

  Facial hair will fall out and not grow back after five days.

  Body hair will begin falling out, leaving smooth skin, after six days.

  Height decrease of 1d6 inches will occur after six days.

  Weight decrease of 1d6x10 pounds will occur at the same time as the height increase.

  If wielder is male or of no gender, wielder becomes female.

  \+1 Dexterity up to 20 if Dexterity is 9 or better. If Dexterity is below 9, +2 to Dexterity.

The Distaff has 1d4 charges (recharging at dawn) while expending a charge has one of the following effects: Dispel Magic, Arcane Lock, or Cat's Grace.

&amp;#x200B;

The Distaff and Rod of Masculinity were created as a pair a very long time ago by two elven archmagi who fell in love at an early age, fell out of love during their careers, and had a VERY messy divorce that took slight animosity and ramped the whole thing up into nearly apocalyptic levels. Tirian Greyscul and Delari Skelenar created several magic items, some of which are actually useful, during their long feud until the day the two started throwing area-of-effect spells at each other in a chance encounter at a local grocer. Rumor has it that Delari went on to become a male and a lich, while Tirian imbued his power and some of his personality into a Sword of Power.

It has also been said that some of the personality of each maker went into the two items and some of the wielders have exhibited traits attributed to Tirian Greyscul and Delari Skelenar. Tirian's tendency towards melodramatic gestures and statements in the Rod of Masculinity's wielder. Delari's viewing of those of lesser wealth and accomplishment as ""mewling worms"" or similar terms. So far, such allegations have not been proven. Possibly because very few choose to keep these items around if they had any other choice.

# ACME GRAB BAG

*very rare,* no attunement necessary

This khaki-colored canvas bag has the logo ""ACME"" on one side in bright yellow letters. Once per turn, a character can use a bonus action to produce an object from the bag.

 1 - Coconut Creme Pie with extra whipped cream.

 2 - Anvil. weighs one pound until thrown or set down, at which point it expands to a five hundred pound anvil.

 3 - A pair of rocket boots. Allows for flight with a movement speed of 120 for 1d4 turns. At the end of that time, roll a dice - on an odd result they explode as a 4d6 fireball.

 4 - Batman suit. Confers no flight or super powers. Has a lot of pockets though.

 5 - Chicken suit. Upon putting the suit on, wearer turns into a chicken. Costume vanishes after being taken off.

 6 - Tyrannosaurus Rex. If insufficient room, use 1d6 velociraptors instead. If at sea use a mosasaur.

 7 - A completely black two-dimensional piece of space/time. When put on a surface, it forms a tunnel that lasts for 15 minutes to connect entirely different locations. Sometimes used by DMs whose players have wandered off all pre-made plans and used to get them at least back onto the correct continent/plane of reality.

 8 - Large black ball with a fuse burning on the top. In three turns it explodes for 1d10x16 damage that spreads out over 60 feet.

The Acme Grab Bag will only appear on holy days dedicated to a trickster god, and then only so long as the DM is bored.

# THE COMFY CHAIR

*very rare*, no attunement

This chair is just a perfectly normal chair. Those knowledgeable about such things can further determine that the wood is fitted together with glue, that the padding on the back and seat are of quilted cotton. Those sitting on it can determine that the chair is indeed quite comfy.

The Comfy Chair is quite soft and comfortable, such that a Will/Wisdom Save is required to get up from it. If the command word is spoken - the seat and back padding will emit a faint penetrating warmth.

The Comfy Chair weighs about 15 pounds, being sturdily made. Some swear it radiates a faint aura of menace, or that it has a Zone of Truth spell upon it. Others swear there is a faint fragrance of vanilla and lavender.

Original reference is from Monty Python, posted as an April Fools item because of Matt Mercer's chair episode.

# CERAMIC BOTTLE

*rare*, no attunement

All enchanters working with experiments have their failures, even when trying to back-engineer an item that already exists. An attempt to make an Iron Bottle with cheaper materials has ended up with a pottery bottle that has an elaborate stopper. The item contains something in stasis, and opening the bottle will release the contents in a plume of smoke, but it is not nearly so powerful as what is normally contained in an Iron Bottle.

1 - A chair. 95% chance of just a normal chair. There is a 5% chance of a Comfy Chair.

2 - Horse, normal.

3 - Dog, elemental.

4 - A perfectly normal ship. (Sloop or other small sailing ship.)

5 - large pile of candy. Normal, non-enchanted variety. Basically a halloween assortment bag.

6 - a large pile of unwashed clothes. Mostly sized for a medium-sized humanoid.

7 - Cat, elemental.

8 - A liquor cabinet. Contains 1d4 bottles of high quality liquor.

Elemental animals should use the stat block of normal creatures of that type, adding 1 HD and having one element (acid, air, earth, fire, ice, lightning, water) where they have resistance to that element plus an attack involving that element.

Once the object within the bottle has been released - the bottle shatters.

## The Demon’s Axe: A D&amp;D Planescape Adventure Starring the Molydeus

Mordenakainen’s Tome of Foes introduces the Molydeus, a demon that stands out from its fellow fiends. The Molydeus is the only Guardian Demon and serves a distinct and almost un-demon-like purpose: policing the will of the demon princes.

It possesses a singularly powerful magical weapon, a vorpal axe, which automatically decapitates its target should the Molydeus roll a natural 20 on its attack. Although the axe is destroyed upon the Molydeus’s death, it retains its power even when wielded by those other than the Molydeus so long as the Molydeus lives.

In this way the Molydeus resembles the Modron, whose body parts survive when dismembered, but only so long as the Modron themselves remain alive. When one dies, it and all its constituent parts turn to ash, and another Modron spawns on Mechanus to take its place. An official Planescape adventure, “The Great Modron March,” plays on this idea, featuring a BBEG who dismembers Modron, affixes their parts to his subordinates to create super soldiers, and keeps the Modron alive in appalling conditions.

Similarly, the DM’s Guide in the box set “Hellbound: The Blood War,” describes a pit fiend that has stolen a Molydeus’s weapon and keeps the creature alive in captivity in order to wield it. The materials stopped at that brief description, never creating an arc for a full adventure.

Let’s do that today.

**Designing the Adventure of The Demon’s Axe**

Molydeus are well-suited for adventures that feature political intrigue and backstabbing. As their purpose is to punish those who defy the demon princes, it makes sense that any Molydeus in a DND adventure is currently tracking down one or more demonic transgressors and the demon being tracked by the Molydeus is seeking to evade capture.

Our premise here is that the axe has been stolen and the Molydeus kept alive to enable another to wield it. So who has stolen the axe? It could either be the demon that is target of the Molydeus’s wrath or a third-party who agrees to help the targeted demon evade capture in exchange for the axe.

Now perhaps evil PCs would be willing to help a demon evade capture and take the axe for themselves by locking the Molydeus away in a planar prison. Good or neutral parties, however, may recoil from placing a creature, even a demon, in a prison of eternal torment just to steal from it. So we will introduce yet another layer to this onion of political intrigue--a fourth party who does not want the third party to possess the axe. The quest will begin with the fourth party commissioning the PCs to destroy the Molydeus, though the fourth party will omit or mislead the PCs about key details, describing the mission as a quest to destroy a demon experiment gone wrong before it’s too late.

Ideally, this mess of political intrigue will hold itself together, and the DM will be able to keep the PCs largely in the dark, until all is revealed by the Molydeus itself at the climax of the adventure. The PCs will need to make a difficult choice that creates winners and losers on all sides, reaping the consequences of whatever they choose.

**A Horrible Experiment: Describing the Quest to the PCs**

Aram Oakwright, a high ranking member of the Fated faction, invites the party to attend the unveiling ceremony of a statue of Duke Rowan Darkwood, the faction’s leader. The PCs witness Factol Darkwood brandish an axe of incredible magical energy as he speaks at the ceremony. After the ceremony, Aram pulls the party aside to offer them a secret mission.

In his tower in the 313th layer of the Abyss, the dread Balor Illssender conducts rogue experiments in the name of the Demon Prince Graz’zt, seeking to create a powerful new type of demon that can bypass the Lady of Pain’s wards and help Graz’zt conquer Sigil. If the Fated can pre-emptively handle this threat, Factol Darkwood hopes to be elected Speaker in Sigil’s House of Speakers, breaking tradition and replacing the Factol of the Sign of the One who currently holds that role. Aram heard of the PCs’ exploits and wants them to travel there and destroy the experiment before it’s too late. The Fated will reward the PCs very handsomely if they succeed on this quest.

**The True Purpose of Killing the Molydeus**

Graz’zt sent the Molydeus, his personal enforcer, to murder Ilssender. The Balor’s crime? Illssender, Graz’zt believes, has begun to acquire such a reputation of charm and debauchery as to rival and diminish his own. After Rowan Darkwood learned this through his web of informants throughout the planes, he offered to help protect Illsender and catch the Molydeus in exchange for the Balor keeping the Molydeus alive and giving the Duke its axe. The Molydeus now lies bound in chains in a secret dungeon in Illsender’s “Pleasure Palace,” the name he has given his tower. Each day, acid drips from the torture device holding the Molydeus, blinding it and rendering it unable to use its formidable strength and magic to escape.

Aram learned these facts as Factol Darkwood’s righthand man and Chief Steward of the Fated’s Hall of Records. He also knows the means of traveling to Illsender’s Pleasure Palace, which the Balor provided to Factol Darkwood when he and his men traveled to the Abyss to help catch the Molydeus.

Aram is a relative of the former Factol, Emma Oakwright, who Rowan Darkwood deposed and exiled in order to take control of the Fated. Aram is plotting to bring Emma Oakwright back to power with other Fated who admire Darkwood’s ambition but are wary of his recklessness. Before Aram can launch his coup d’etat against the Duke, he must first rid the Duke of the powerful axe that makes him an incomparable fighter. To destroy the Molydeus and its axe, he hires the PCs, as he fears that relying on any fellow Fated to take on the task would leave him vulnerable to betrayal.

**Traveling to the Abyss**

The PCs travel to the 313th layer of the Abyss according to the instructions provided by Aram. If the DM prefers they embark on a longer journey, that may involve riding down the Styx on a boat piloted by a Merrenoloth, a Yugoloth boatsmen. Along the way, the party may encounter rampaging demons or unpredictable waters that threaten to expose the party to the waters of the Styx, which causes all therein submersed to lose their former memories.

If the Adventure is being prepared as a one-shot, or if the PCs are frequent travelers to the lower planes, the DM may wish to handwave the journey by creating a direct portal to Ilssender’s Pleasure Palace. The portal would be one of the windows in the devil-themed Sensorium in the Lower War, “Nine Layers of Pleasure,” and the key would be imagining a perverse act, either specified by the DM or left unnamed.

**Illsender’s Pleasure Palace**

I leave the details of the Pleasure Palace to the DM. They should match both the characters’ level and the players’ comfort level with sexually oriented or deviant material. If the DM has any question about the latter, she should consult with the players and make sure everyone is on the same page, possibly adding safe words or other signals a player can use to signal discomfort.

The design goal of the Palace is threefold.

First, a pleasure palace in the Abyss is a roleplaying structure to reflect on sexual mores, morality, and the taboo. Graz’zt, the demon Prince who Illsender emulates, is described in Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes (p.148) as “a master of charm and subtle manipulation,” who “considers restriction the only sin.” His lairs are described as “pleasure palaces where nothing is forbidden, save moderation or kindness.” In keeping with this description and in order to facilitate reflection without unduly pushing players’’ boundaries, everything that takes place in in the Palace should be consensual, though perhaps the subtle nature and critical importance of consent itself could be one of the philosophical questions prompted by the adventure.

Second, the DM should provide clues that Aram has not been completely honest with the PCs. For example, those present in the Pleasure Palace might be aware of certain facts about the Molydeus locked in the basement. These may include a) it is a Molydeus, a guardian demon; b) it was captured and brought to the Pleasure Palace with the help of some humans; or c) it is perpetually kept in a weakened state to prevent it from escaping. The DM should also provide hints that Illssender does not, in fact, work for Graz’zt. On the contrary, residents of the Palace know that Illssender worries about Graz’zt’s plots against him. These hints will set the stage for the climactic scene where the PC’s encounter the Molydeus, below.

Third, the adventures within the palace should appropriately drain the party’s resources before the showdown with Illsender, the final boss. How many encounters the GM includes ought to depend on the strength of her PCs, how she runs games, and whether this is a one-shot or longer adventure. If the GM believes a Balor is too challenging for her PCs, perhaps the Balor arrives unprepared for battle and without one or both of its weapons, having just pulled itself away from a sexual encounter. The timing of this final battle is critical, as it should occur immediately after the climactic encounter with the Molydeus.

**The Climax: The True Nature of the “Experiment” Revealed**

After working their way through the Pleasure Palace and expending a significant amount of their resources, the PCs should finally reach the dungeon room holding the Molydeus (I picture the torture scene in the Princess Bride as the setting for this encounter, though it could be more like a converted BDSM dungeon). There the PCs find a twisted abomination of a demon, much like Aram told them. Closer inspection reveals, however, that the demon is not being transformed into a powerful new weapon, but rather is being tortured and imprisoned.

As they approach the Molydeus, it asks the PCs if they were sent by Lord Graz’zt to free it. When the PCs say no, disappointed, it asks them to free it and tells them it needs to hunt down the person who stole its axe and imprisoned it here. At this time, the Molydeus does not know that its captor was Factol Darkwood, though it has seen its captor and could give a physical description.

If the PCs continue to engage it in conversation, it will correctly surmise that whoever sent the PCs to kill it wants to deprive whoever possesses the axe of access to the weapon. The players then must choose between killing the Molydeus, leaving it in captivity, and freeing it.

At the climactic moment the players resolve how they wish to handle this decision, Illssender breaks into the Dungeon, declares his outrage that his Pleasure Palace has been thus defiled, and attacks the PCs. If Illsender defeats the PCs, he enslaves them and sends them off to the front lines of the Blood War under his unit’s command. Otherwise, once the PCs defeat Illssender, resistance within the palace fades and the PCs are free to return to Sigil at their leisure.

**Consequences of the Players’ Choices**

If the players leave the Molydeus chained to its torture device, Factol Darkwood will retain his weapon and Aram’s plot will be foiled. Aram will come after the PCs and attempt to destroy the evidence of his treachery by murdering them. If the PCs report all of this back to Factol Darkwood, he will promote the PCs, and they will become his trusted agents.

If the PCs free the Molydeus, it immediately will assist them in fighting Illssender. Thereafter, it will hunt down and kill Rowan Darkwood. Aram will not know of the fiend’s plans, however, and will believe that his own plot has been foiled, so he will first come after the PCs and attempt to kill them to destroy the evidence of his treachery. The Molydeus may later murder Aram as well.

If the PCs kill the Molydeus, its weapon will disappear and Aram’s coup d’etat will succeed. The rebels will kill Rowan Darkwood, and Emma Oakwright will regain her title as Factol of the Fated. The PCs will become one of Emma’s most favored and trusted agents. She will not tell the PCs the link between their actions and the Duke’s death. If she learns that the PCs know of this connection, she will either murder the PCs or frame them for the Duke’s death.

**Making the Scenario Your Own**

Note that almost all of the specifics here could be replaced to suit the needs of the DM’s own campaign. The PCs could be approached by the deputy of any organization, told to travel to any location, and asked to kill any being that is keeping alive the Molydeus. The key plot point that holds it all together is that the questgiver wishes to overthrow its boss but must first deprive that boss of the Molydeus’s powerful axe, which can only be accomplished by slaying the Molydeus itself.

Political backstabbing of this type is common to all fantasy worlds, so the adventure of The Demon’s Axe could be a one-shot adventure in a common fantasy world, or a whole adventure path in a Planescape campaign.

**Footnote**

The Molydeus is unique for another reason: its representative miniature ranks among D&amp;D’s most rare and expensive. Ral Partha produced an unpainted metal version in its acclaimed Planescape 11-series, then re-released the miniature in gem-studded pewter under the Partha Pewter label. The Molydeus typically fetches the highest auction prices among 11-series miniatures. TSR and WOTC have never released a pre-painted Molydeus.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,43,349,"Meerak, Bjorn, Draziw, and Lars (my players) NO READING! First, huge shoutout to a [post on armor upgrades](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8kdcjj/upgrade_your_armour_upgrades/) ten months ago by u/NotActuallyAGoat and those that contributed to it. My work here is an expansion on this user's brilliant idea and you should definitely check it out to add to your notes. Although I draw on this old post as inspiration, I have made adjustments and added a few of my own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Armor Upgrades**

In this system, a player can upgrade their character's armor at a highly skilled armor smith. Any mundane armor can hold a primary upgrade and a secondary upgrade. By choosing an upgrade, a character permanently changes their armor and reversing the upgrade would involve buying a whole new set (but this up to your discretion, of course).

Certain upgrades require a certain type of armor, as specified by the *italics* headings. As far as I can tell, only the secondary upgrade **Tailored** conflicts with any of the primary upgrades (again your discretion).

&amp;#x200B;

## Primary Upgrades

*Any Armor Type*

* **Blessed**: resistance to necrotic damage
* **Mirrored**: (may conflict with **Tailored**)\* resistance to radiant damage
* **Padded**: critical hits do not affect you for bludgeoning damage.
* **Runic**: critical hits do not affect you for one of the following damage types: fire, cold, lightening, or thunder.
* **Super Spiked**: (requires **Spiked**) your armor is completely covered in points of varying sizes. Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 piercing damage. On a melee hit, the attacker takes piercing damage equal to half your level. Any enemy makes grappling checks against you with disadvantage. On any Acrobatics Check where the result is a natural 1, you take half your level in piercing damage.

*Heavy/Medium*

* **Copper Plated**: resistance to acid damage
* **Diving Armor**: this armor allows you to breath underwater for 30 minutes at a time.
* **Hard Knocker**: (requires a helmet) you gain a modification to your helmet. You can perform a headbutt attack as an unarmed attack, using strength for the attack roll, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the helmet is a bucket, as in the **Bucket Head** upgrade, the hit creates a loud bell noise that can be heard from up to 60 feet away and the damage is increased to 1d6 bludgeoning. This attack can be performed when restrained or grappled, unless one’s head is restrained.
* **Heavy**: Disadvantage on Acrobatics Checks and increases strength minimum for the armor by 1. If there is no strength minimum, then the armor’s strength minimum is 13. But, you cannot be pushed, pulled, or knocked prone without a successful Athletics (for melee) or Spell Casting Focus (for spells) Check of DC 10 + your Athletics Modifier.
* **Magnetic**: On any melee attack against you with a metal weapon, an attack roll of 1 will cause the metal weapon to stick to the armor. You can use an action on your turn to attempt to disarm the opponent with a competing Athletics check. Otherwise, the attacker can use an action to attempt a DC 12 Athletics Check to remove the weapon.

*Light*

* **Hidden Crossbow**: your armor has a hidden *light crossbow* with stats as described in the PHB. The crossbow cannot be disarmed since it is attached to you. A creature can make a DC 15 Investigation Check to notice the hidden crossbow, else it is obvious.
* **Hidden Blades**: your armor has two hidden *daggers* as described in the PHB. The daggers cannot be disarmed since they are attached to you. A creature can make a DC 15 Investigation Check to notice the sheathed daggers, else they are obvious.
* **Grappling Hook**: (not possible with **Tailored**) your armor has a built in grappling hook with a 30 ft range. Make a ranged attack against a target. If the attack hits, the type of target determines the next outcome:
   * If the target is a structure or a creature of size Huge or larger, you can pull yourself through the air to the target.
   * If the target is a creature of size Large or smaller, you can attempt to pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you. Both the target and you must make competing Athletics Checks. The target moves 10 ft toward you if the target loses the contested check and then, at the end of your turn, the grappling hook shoots back to your armor.

&amp;#x200B;

\*If your character dresses like Elton John, **Mirrored** will not conflict with **Tailored**; otherwise, there's a conflict.

## Secondary Upgrades

*Any Armor Type*

* **Climbing Claws**: while wearing this armor, a creature has advantage on Climbing (Athletics) Checks.
* **Comfortable**:  you can sleep in this armor and gain the benefits of a long rest.
* **Camouflaged**: this armor gives advantage on Stealth Checks if the camouflage reasonably fits the terrain.
* **Inflatable**: this armor has a cord that, when pulled, allows you to rise out of the water and float.
* **Modular**: can remove armor as an action.
* **Slippery**: disadvantage on being grappled.
* **Sticky**: advantage to grapple.
* **Spiked**: Choose one of the following:
   * your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 damage
   * attackers take 1d4 damage when hitting you with a melee attack
* **Stinky**: advantage on Intimidation Checks, disadvantage on Persuasion Checks.

*Heavy/Medium*

* **Bucket Head**: Disadvantage to Perception Checks. Advantage to Deception Checks.
* **Hardened**: a creature takes half damage from the critical hit dice if the damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

*Light*

* **Form Fitted**: this upgrade offers a +3 to Acrobatics Checks.
* **Tailored**: (conflicts with **Grappling Hook** and possibly with Mirrored) this set of armor is disguised to look like a normal set of clothes. The player and DM can determine the style. A creature can discover that the armor is a disguise on a successful Investigation Check, DC 15.

&amp;#x200B;

**Determining Primary Or Secondary Upgrade**

I wanted the Primary Upgrades to give players another possible action in combat or a strong damage resistance, with the exception of **Spiked** which deals damage. Ultimately, I did not want people doubling up on resistances, hence the primary/secondary categories prevent this. Secondary upgrades were the grab-bag category. I see these as adding fun opportunities to role play while also serving an in-game purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I would recommend only offering a few upgrades at a time, as to not overwhelm the players. I hope this expansion of u/NotActuallyAGoat's system is helpful and I'm excited to premiere it in my own game tomorrow. All in all, leave any recommendations you have in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: so many spellings

EDIT 2: **Visualizing Some Upgrades**

Along with some changes to **Spiked,** the addition of the **Super Spiked** option, and interplay between **Bucket Head** &amp; **Hard Knocker**, I wanted to clarify some of the upgrade designs in my head. Of course, these are not hard and fast rules. Consider these inspiration for you and your player, who may have a better idea of how these should look/work. I included links to Google Images for inspiration.

**Diving Armor** \- I imagined this like [old diving gear](https://www.google.com/search?q=old+diving+gear&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ0ePO26bhAhWmiOAKHYU2DAEQ_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1368&amp;bih=770) but with plate or chain mail (for my campaign, I'm including light armor too), where the armor is made insulated on the inside and uses a strange helmet and tube system to breathe. But it could also be as visually simple as a fish bowl on someone's head (it is DnD after all).

**Hidden Crossbow/Blades** \- I saw these as spring loaded collapsible parts of the armor, probably in the forearm. Think Assassin's Creed [Crossbow](https://www.google.com/search?q=assassin%27s+creed+crossbow&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqgJLY3KbhAhUOVN8KHS-NBEsQ_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1368&amp;bih=770#imgrc=5qljwtoxbTkzYM:) and [Blades](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn11.bigcommerce.com%2Fs-0kvv9%2Fimages%2Fstencil%2F1280x1280%2Fproducts%2F132636%2F183388%2Faguilarshiddenblade__26328.1465624929.jpg%3Fc%3D2&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftoywiz.com%2Fmcfarlane-toys-assassins-creed-movie-aguilars-hidden-blade-role-play-toy%2F&amp;docid=MKaBpXLbuHV6rM&amp;tbnid=SyI8WOu4ODKl8M%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=780&amp;h=438&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim). However, I know one of my players will try to put this on his crotch...that design I leave to the imagination.

**Grappling Hook** \- So the inspiration for this is Batman and the Thorn Whip Spell combined. Unlike the hidden crossbow, the grappling hook requires 30 ft of rope and a pulling mechanism. Therefore, I imagine this thing (which is already a stretch of physics) like a small cannon/crossbow on the top side of the forearm with a *tightly* coiled gear in the back. The hook fires out, grabs, and then the tension of the gear pulls the character ahead. I would wave off the specifics for fun's sake. If your table wants to go full spider man web swingers with this thing or engineer your own medieval grappling hook in more detail, that's fine too.

**Inflatable** \- I imagine this like airbags tucked in small unnoticeable plates in the armor that explode when activated and must be repaired to use again.

**Modular** \- I would add small clasps on the shoulders, legs, and etc that cause the armor to flop onto the ground on either side of the character.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3:

Changes to **Form Fitted** from advantage on Acrobatics to a +3 (slightly more than the +2 given to most attack rolls by the Fighting Style Traits because it doesn't deal damage) because this I don't want this to be insanely better than doing acrobatics checks unarmored.",1,Upgrades for Common Armor

Characters track down and destroy the Midnight Ivy Cult and return the pin to the captain's wife. She asks that it is taken for cleansing at the local cleric's chapel. 

The characters take the pin to the cleric, who agrees to cleanse the pin so long as they help him find another 'patient' for his research on a disease called Skale. He eventually returns the pin, still cursed, and tells the characters it must be reforged in the original flame it was forged in. 

The captain's wife agrees to bring the party to the site of her father's forge, now laying in the ruins of an old, broken home in the woods to the near west of Hanlon's Pass. There, the captain's wife strikes up the forge and summons her sisters disembodied spirit as a Spectre. Lily reforges the pin, banishing the evil spirit and reuniting her sister's spirit with her father's spirit, who bestow Protection from Undead on The Gorse Pin, so long as it is worn by a daughter.

# Acheron Re-Imagined: The Endless Tournament

*You wake up with a start to the siren’s blares. Grabbing your weapon and armor, you head to the Battle Door, where your fellow adventurers are wearily mustering. You grab the handles bolted into the floor and brace for collision, which comes hard.*

*The magic mouth stops blaring, and then announces in that dreaded voice, “Prepare for Battle: The Rusted Blade versus Maglubiyet’s Children.” The doors open, revealing an arena of aerial ropes linking turret towers above a floor covering in metal spikes. Across the arena, you see the soldiers of Maglubiyet’s Children race towards the pivotal central platforms.*

*You sigh as your commander begins barking out orders. Just another day in Acheron.*

Acheron is a plane of law, where the orders of one’s superior supersedes all personal desire, where battle rages across cubes, both on their outer faces and on the tunnels and battlescapes within. But what are the laws of conflict that govern the collisions of these cubes? In this article, we will re-imagine Acheron as a plane of hierarchical combat perfectly suited for combat-heavy adventures.

**What’s missing from the official materials**

The official Planescape and DND 5e materials describe Acheron as a plane where iron cubes constantly collide with each other. Armies unceasingly muster and wage war on the outer faces of the cubes and on the tunnels that worm their way within.

On a philosophical level, Acheron seems to embody mindless obedience and conformity, as victory and ceasefire are impossible. The cubes collide with each other randomly, or at least the pattern of their collision is not provided by the official materials. Nor is it clear how one could purposefully move from cube to cube, or what ‘progress’ would look like in Acheron.

On the gameplay level, it supports scavenging through battlefields or being thrust into pointless struggles, perhaps as slaves, mercenaries, or unwilling participants.

But is this realizing Acheron’s potential as a plane embodying law and conflict? The battlefields of the Blood War on Avernus already provide the same gameplay options, while being set in a more interesting philosophical backdrop. Maybe Acheron is designed to be more accessible to lower level PCs than the fiend-ridden lower planes, but the plane still feels a bit lackluster.

Let’s see how we can spice it up.

**Acheron: The Endless Tournament**

Re-imagined, Acheron is an enormous, unending tournament where teams of combatants strive only to advance in rank through victory. At all times there can be only one champion, and that champion, like a professional boxer, must be ready to take all challengers, so few teams hold the belt for long.

Thus imagined, instead of Acheron’s inhabitants fighting for no clear objective, the objective now is to win. Unlike the Blood War raging in Avernus, where Demons and Devils hope to spread their ideologies of chaos and law, victory in Acheron’s tournament is not a means to an end, but an end in itself. Thus Acheron carves out a unique and interesting philosophical space within the outer planes, and allows GMs to explore the human drive to compete and game, and what winning means when determined within a system of arbitrarily defined rules.

**How it works**

Battle teams enter the tournament in one of two ways: by fighting a “collision” in Acheron’s gate-town, Rigus, or by winning sufficiently impressive victories in the name of one of Acheron’s gods. The latter is the chief method of entry for the Goblinoids and Orcs who make up many of Acheron’s combatants, while planars and primes typically enter through collisions. (Goblins and Orcs who die in combat in the name of Acheron’s gods also emerge in Acheron as petitioners.)

To enter a collision, one’s battle team must meet the legal requirements to lease a cube in Rigus. Cubes are physical headquarters for battle teams, equipped with beds, basic supplies, etc. The city is made up of thousands of cubes of various sizes which replenish themselves as the blocks of vanquished teams magically reappear in Rigus.

Once a team has acquired a cube, it must prove itself in lesser battles in Rigus until it is invited to participate in a collision, a formal match between two teams, officially fought until surrender, but in practice fought to the death, as most combatants value their pride over their lives.

The winner’s cube then launches into the plane of Acheron, where it collides with other cubes of similar rank. Victors move on and acquire spoils from the losers, including part of the loser’s cube, which merges with and enlarges the victor’s cube. After a certain number of victories, a combat team completes a level and arrives at a supply cube. There it docks for a designated period of time, giving the team the chance to purchase supplies, hire mercenaries, and buy slaves. Supply cubes also have portals back to Sigil or other locations in the planes to facilitate trade and adventures...or escape!

**No holds barred arena combat**

When two cubes collide in Acheron, combat does not take place on the cubes themselves, but rather on a third arena cube, into which both other cubes crash. Shortly before impact, a magic mouth enchanted on a huge, magically sealed doorway of the cube loudly blares a siren. Upon impact, the magic mouth announces both combatants (or up to 6 combatants, as some collisions involve combat teams colliding onto each face of the arena cube). This can be done in the boxing announcer Let’s get ready to ruuuuummble style, or in one that suits your fancy.

All sealed doors then magically open simultaneously, revealing the battle arena. Battle arenas may have tactically important high ground in the middle, secret caches of weapons or healing potions, devious traps, countdown effects like the release of poisonous gas that discourage trench warfare, or hostile constructs or monsters--basically, anything to increase the challenge and fun of combat.

They can be one large room or many rooms; an outer cube with tunnels winding within or an urban cityscape. Each arena cube need bear no resemblance to those before and after it; each is a discrete battle environment designed to test its combatants. This gives the GM leeway to create diverse environments without causing one’s story to feel disjointed or nonsensical.

The DM may organize collisions around the adventuring day. If parties only fight one battle on each cube, the party may collide with three cubes in one day; if each arena contains multiple discrete encounters, collisions may be less frequent. Battle is fought until death or surrender. After one side is defeated, the magic mouth loudly announces that the victor has a specified period of time to return to its cube, after which the cube detaches and again begins colliding up Acheron’s tournament.

**Don’t forget the roleplay**

Although re-imagined Acheron supports combat-heavy encounters, players should have opportunities for role-playing as well. Given Acheron’s philosophical underpinnings, I suggest exploring questions such as the morality of following orders, victory as an end in itself and not merely a means to an end, and the ethics of sacrifice.

Will the PCs kill enemy slaves who are forced to fight against their will, knowing that to spare them may mean putting themselves at risk? If a scenario gives the players an option to sacrifice one of their own, kamikaze-style, in exchange for a strong mechanical benefit in a battle, will they do it? What if their goblin opponents make a sacrifice and immediately gain the upper hand? Can the players convince NPCs of the pointlessness of the entire endeavor?

Acheron arena combats, like all Planescape encounters, should never be far removed from these philosophical and moral dilemmas.

**Getting started**

So how do you throw the PC’s into Acheron?

Perhaps they are on a diplomatic mission or secretly investigating one of Rigus’s battle teams when the cube they are in suddenly launches into Acheron. They become reluctant conscripts, at least until they reach the first re-supply cube.

Or maybe they are slaves stolen from a Blood War battlefield or from the battlegrounds of Ysgard and made to fight against their will, allowing the GM to contrast different ideological conceptions of why we fight.

Or perhaps the players are just mercenaries who need the coin. PCs can enter Acheron at any of the supply cubes, so higher level PCs may enter at later stages of the tournament and receive commensurately larger compensation.

However the PCs enter, GMs should make sure that Acheron’s battle arenas are filled with challenging tactical combat and philosophical questions about the nature of obedience and sport.",1,Acheron Re-Imagined: The Endless Tournament

#Understanding the Web of Life

All druids can instinctively feel the complex ecologies that surround them as a shifting pressure on their bodies and their minds. This is a physical and psychological manifestation and in areas of almost pure balance (Neutrality), the Druid is at peace, with no external pressure on him. It is in these rare environments that the druid can relax and feel the true glory of the natural world in harmony.

Areas that are out of this balance convey pressure and tension. The further away from balance the ecology is, the stronger this pressure. In areas of great chaos/control, the druid will experience physical pain, an uncomfortable and insistent pressure, like being crushed. They will also experience extreme anxiety, manifesting in a number of neuroses (let the Druid decide how this plays out). This is the reason for the militant reputation of the druid - areas that fall outside the balance can drive a druid to madness. This phenomenon compels the druid to seek balance in the world. Without it, they risk the loss of sanity, and compassion. 

Druids combat ecological chaos/control. They are warriors of balance, and they approach their roles with careful deliberation before interfering. This can be difficult in the face of what the Druids call, ""The Burden"" - the discomfort that comes from being in areas that are out of balance. 

When a Druid enters a new region, they know the state of the balance immediately. Chaos or control, they will have an instant impression on what is weakening the location. This is an innate class ability. 

They will walk through the area and catalogue the plant, fungi, insect, avian, reptile, aquatic, mammalian, humanoid, and monster life that is present, and this will allow them to formulate a plan to restore the balance. 

If there is too much order, as when humans control their birth rate and systematically exploit the natural resources without renewal, the Druid introduces chaos - without change, nature stagnates. 

If there is too much chaos, as when prey or predators outnumber one another, or humanoid populations are too large for the land to support, the Druid introduces order - without limits, nature becomes dangerous. 

This process of balancing an area requires a solid knowledge of medicines, poisons, agriculture, forestry, and the myriad natural sciences that all druids possess. Druids should never specialize, they should never become experts, but remain always students and always curious and willing to share knowledge with their fellow druids. 

In the above case of too much order, the Druid will sow wild seeds, introduce fire, spike water supplies with aphrodisiacs, slaughter prey or predators to regain a more natural dynamic. The Druid encourages nature to fluctuate again, without strangling variation. 

In the above case of too much chaos, the Druid will cull the populations, whether humanoid, monster, or animal, and will do so without mercy or debate. The Druid encourages nature to reach a more harmonious relationship with the life that inhabits it. 

Druids are agents of life and death. Without judgment. Without mercy. They seek always to relieve the pressure of the discord of the world on themselves. Literally. This is the burden of accepting the truth when joining the Druidic order - that the World cannot shepherd itself. Nature is a mindless force, and life is a greedy fact. It must be carefully shaped and encouraged to find parity, or destroy itself and humanity along with it. The Druid's ultimate charge is to safeguard all life, if possible.

Druids talk to the animals. They talk to the plants. They do not do so with the words of the languages they speak. They do so by becoming attuned to the creatures and plantlife that surrounds them. Much like an adventurer will attune a magic item, a druid can attune a living being that isn't humanoid or monster (e.g., animals, minerals, and plants). 

### Natural Attunement Example 

Y'Gesh, a 5th Circle Druid, has a mystery to solve, and has come to the forest to speak to the Elder Tree, the oldest of its kind in this region. Y'Gesh does not speak tree, for trees do not speak, but Y'Gesh comes anyway, understanding that plants still communicate with one another, albeit in ways alien to most creatures. Y'Gesh finds the Elder Tree, after many weeks of searching, and approaches it with reverence. The druid knows that vibration is the fastest way to get a plant's attention (short of fire), and greets a nearby boulder by laying his hand upon its surface and speaking his name, in friendship. ""I am Y'Gesh. I come in friendship. I ask a permission to speak to the Elder Tree.""

And Y'Gesh waits. Knowing stone, they process vibration much slower than plants do, and Y'Gesh eats an apple while he waits. As he's devouring the core, the boulder ""chimes"" softly. Y'Gesh's vibration, returned. If the vibration had been dispersed, unheard, into the earth, he would have known his request was denied. As the boulder has approved, Y'Gesh thanks the boulder, aloud, and approaches the Elder Tree. He removes his boots (if he was wearing any). Takes off his pack and gear and stretches his limbs, and drinks water. 

Y'Gesh sits with his back against the massive oak, and closes his eyes, breathing to achieve calmness and allows his mind to become aware of the tree at his back. He sits and waits until he feels that the Tree has accepted his presence, coming slowly awake from its shared-mind(root)-perspective. Y'Gesh speaks his request aloud, and waits. 

The Tree is attuned to Y'Gesh and Y'Gesh is attuned to the Tree. An exchange has been made. A promise of friendship and a request. The Tree, old and thick, more accustomed to the language of seasons and weather, takes a long time to process Y'Gesh's language. The Tree knows many tongues, having eavesdropped on the world since it was young, but its a distant memory. The moon rises and sets. The sun rises and sets. The moon rises and the Tree responds to Y'Gesh. It sends a Sprite to him, and the fey bids the druid to follow. 

Y'Gesh could sit with his feet in a stream for a day and a night and attune to the river to ask it if it knows about a piece of history hundreds of years old that took place on its banks. 

Y'Gesh could attune to a whitetail buck and ask it if its seen a particular looking elf in its feeding grounds. 

The Druid could simply cast a spell and ask the creature, but this leaves the animal shaken, and confused by the encounter. Such an intrusion is often traumatic for a creature that has no concept of spoken language. ""Speak with Animals"" is only used when haste is needed. 

Humanoids and *Cervidae* do not usually speak with one another. Indeed, the deer Family cannot speak with any other creatures except other *Cervidae*, just as bears cannot talk to non-*Ursine* creatures. Species cannot communicate effectively with one another, beyond the rudimentary ""fight or flight"" postures and calls that all animals innately understand. There is no ""Woodland Common"" (or any terrain type for that matter), and the Druid must carefully select which creatures to speak to in order to spread messages, warnings, or requests, as they will not be able to talk to all of them via spellcraft. 

Some druids have created rituals that allow them to speak to individual animal Families within a region collectively, sort of a mass-commune, but these are rarely used and only in times of emergency.

### Affinities

Druids walk hand-in-hand with the natural magic energies that arise from mineral matrices, and this is the source of their great power. Leylines, focused locations like standing circles, natural phenomenon like waterfalls and areas prone to storms are all favorites for recharging their magical abilities. Simply being in a natural area accomplishes the same thing, but at a much slower rate. 

Mechanically this means that a druid regains spell slots differently. They receive 1 spent slot per short rest, and 4 slots per long. If they visit a ""site of power"", as mentioned above, they regain all spent slots after a long rest, and half on a short. This requires the Druid to ration their magic use carefully, and instead rely on their natural talents to survive wherever possible. Druids are natural survivalists, and prefer to commune with their settings rather than dominate it, if such a relationship steers things towards Balance.  Druids can find solace in other ways. Moonlight is effective for recharging lost magical abilities, and natural amphitheaters that heighten sound and energy (especially if water is present) are good places for druids to rest and recharge.

### Wildshape

Wildshape is the ultimate form of domination and deception. To walk among the beasts as one of them is not easy. Simply imitating a shape is not enough. The druid must carefully study the creature he wants to imitate for many days or weeks, observing their natural behavior in a variety of situations.

For those druids who are impatient, they may find themselves attracting hostile attention from the dominate members of the pack - who can sense something is ""off"", the druid may be attacked and severely injured or killed, or driven off.

Wildshape should be a ritual, not a spell, and should not be undertaken lightly. Time and patience is required to be effective. 

### Philosophies

Druids who lean towards the lawful end of TN have lost their predilection for subtlety, having been disenchanted with the continuing struggle against the excesses of unchecked nature. Their spellwork is coercive and is based on domination and control. The subjects of their spellwork know they have been ensorcelled, and know that they are not seen as equals in the eyes of the controlling druid.

Druids who lean towards the chaotic end of TN have lost their predilection for control, understanding that mutual trust is a more effective, but more unpredictable way of approaching their relationships. Their spellwork is cooperative and is based on trust and friendship. The subjects of their spellwork give their aid freely, and are seen as equals in the eyes of the friendly druid. However, this comes with a large drawback, and that is that nature is fickle, and often withdraws permissions without warning, and the druid may labor under a misconception when it comes to just what exactly that sandstone boulder agreed to last year.

These two philosophies are constantly at odds with one another, and there are frequent bouts of internal conflict, that occasionally escalates to violence. The ""real"" TN Druids are in a constant state of flux with these extreme factions, and at least as much time is devoted to managing these conflicts as is spent shepherding the wilds. 

### Final 

For me, the Druid isn't simply a wilderness cleric, they are a vital part of the vast web of nature and in my worldbuilding, I prefer to tie them to their role in a more mystical, organic fashion. I hope you found this post interesting, and leave me a comment if you'd like to discuss this more. Thanks!",1,"Druids, Balance, and The Burden"

*The border region between the planes of Water and Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and slime. Here and there within the* [Swamp of Oblivion,](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c7/8d/d0/c78dd083c775133dbc897f132b91262c--call-of-cthulhu-dungeons-and-dragons.jpg) *stagnant lakes and pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden structures suspended above the muck...No solid earth underlies the mud of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink down into it.*

Above is the popular mental image of the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze, the area between elemental water and elemental earth, an understanding which is quite pervasive in modern literature and culture. However, it is deeply misleading. The ""Swamp of Oblivion"" is but one small part of this plane of existence, and makes but one tiny sliver of the infinite depths of the plane.

&amp;#x200B;

The plane was discovered in pre-history, early into our understanding of the planes. Early sailors in the [Elemental Plane of Water](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/93qc1s/the_elemental_plane_of_water_endless_sea/) made the trek across the Silt Flats and found themselves in a deeply inhospitable place. Nowadays the journey over the Mud Hills from the Elemental Plane of Earth is more common, and several portals directly to this plane are known, including the [Oblivion Maw](http://pre07.deviantart.net/c858/th/pre/f/2015/232/b/4/zryujin_by_dopepope-d96fy1z.jpg) in the flooded forest near White Plume Mountain, and [certain caves](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tbEDG23D7p8/TI9CyxyjgCI/AAAAAAAAAGs/wQsLqTC8vNA/s1600/Clay+Dam+Cave+1.JPG) in the wide Clay Hills near halfling-led Susanna. But the place is no more welcoming.

&amp;#x200B;

The equipment and preparation necessary to survive an expedition into the plane of Ooze varies wildly across its terrain, and depending on your goal. It's inhabitants, too, vary dramatically by geography (and the plane is believed to have the highest concentration of non-elemental life forms of any inner plane). In fact, there is quite possibly only one thing consistent across the plane:

# Oozes

[Watsonian](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/66wxqq/ooze/)

[Doylist](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4zbpg1/outside_the_manual_oozes/)

Oozes are very strange creatures and unique creatures, and are consistently found throughout most of the plane, and they contribute a very large amount to the non-elemental life there. Some sort of resistance (or possibly immunity) is highly recommended for exploration anywhere on the plane, but isn't strictly necessary- extreme caution will be enough if you never let your guard down, and a dearth of 10-foot poles will suffice for most ooze threats, but it's awfully risky, and frankly you should have all three.

Most oozes are not a serious threat; green slimes and black puddings and grey oozes and brown molds will all whittle you down over time, but on their own are rarely an immediate threat to adventurers. However, you must not underestimate that whittling down; each time you accidentally step or sink in an acidic puzzle, you come closer to death, even if you get back out.

There are exceptions to this rule:

**Great Pits. **There are splashes of acidic ooze all around the plane, but in some places there are great pits and lakes of it, that aren't immediately recognizable as such without sinking into them. 10-foot poles are absolutely necessary for exploration on this plane.

**White Maws.** The Thayan cultists c. 300-400 P.C. were known to have maintained control over a massive ooze the size of galleon, as intelligent as any humanoid, and quite malicious in intent. It isn't well understood where that particular ooze came from, but similar creatures are known to be found in the plane of Ooze, identical to marbled stone until they make their moves.

**The Cloud of Alkanax.** It was debated whether this swarm of Oozes really qualified at all, or whether it was some grand aberration or obscure negative elemental. However, we now understand this creature to be made up of hundreds of tiny oozes swarming in a huge necrotic cloud, sucking all the moisture out of its victims, possibly heralding from the areas of this plane closest to the plane of negative energy. If you see this black cloud coming over the horizon, run. There is nothing you can do.

You already know the most about this place out of all the places. It is much like an ordinary swamp, but everything exaggerated and larger than life, and all of the murky water is filled with acidic mud and toxic ooze. The trees are tall as skyscrapers, streams wide as highway roads, clouds of mosquitos the size of elephants and crocodiles even larger. Hags, lizardfolk, and some poor humans live here, scraping away their survival in their houses stilted up above the muck, or tied together up in the trees. The villages are isolated and haggard, too desperate to play politics or build grand civilizations. Without magic, there is no potable water here, only disease-infested ponds of swamp muck. I would not interact with these people for long.

The most infamous natural portal to this realm is in the belly of **Oblivion Maw**, a gargantuan black monstrous crocodile living in the flooded forests east of the mountains. Its victims find themselves transported to this plane, but be careful if you intend to use this to your advantage- you must find a way to be swallowed whole, or the only thing transported to the plane will be bits and pieces of flesh and bone.

&gt;*It took fourteen months before he let the village have their funeral. He was still holding onto some last shred of hope. The two boys had held onto it until the end.*

An Oblivion is a place which there is no way to escape from. An Oubliette, on the other hand, is a place with only one- that is, the top. The entrance to the Oubliette is nearby the human settlements in the Swamp of Oblivion, and there grows driftglobes on long vines. These driftglobes will, upon being plucked, shine for 3d8 hours before running out and leaving you dark and alone in the pits of the dungeon.

Throughout the Oubliette are strange traps and creatures easily capable of ending your life, but if you manage to make it to the bottom of the Oubliette without losing your light or life, you will find the being called **Hawa Hayya,** who will answer you any question you have about the nature of the plane or the universe, and personally transport you back to the material plane. Or at least, so it is said.

&amp;#x200B;

***Encounters:***

* A room with dozens of **giant crocodiles,** each with terrible perception scores and the *spider climb* ability, with the only way onward being through them all (perhaps up to a door on the ceiling).
* A moving plant grasping at your legs to grapple you while 4 **stone golems** come to life and begin to march towards you.
* The creature from the ""reflaying"" section of [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4r9by3/outside_the_manual_reskinning/)
* A goddess statue holding a powerful magical artifact in the same room as a **Sibriex** demon (MToF).
* A **Medusa**'s layer, who has been reanimating her victims as **slithering trackers** (VGtM) to attack her many enemies.
* A bottomless pit filled with a very thin slime that one must succeed on a DC 13 Strength or Constitution check to successfully swim through each turn.
* Periods of magical darkness which only devil's sight, *daylight,* or one of the driftglobes from outside can pierce.
* A **Roper** covered in ooze. Both it and anything it's grappling take a 3d8 acid damage on the beginning of its turns.

# Choking Smogs

&gt;*smoke grasps at your ankles*  
&gt;  
&gt;*it forces itself down your throat, biting and gnawing at your eyes*  
&gt;  
&gt;*your skin boils*  
&gt;  
&gt;*your lungs scream for mercy*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It doesn't matter. You have already died.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*you just haven't finished feeling it*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-* Xi Zhaolung, hobgoblin adventurer poet, upon returning from a dungeon in the Biles of Dú

Near the Swamp of Oblivion, there is a region of the plane where plumes of toxic smoke burst out of the muddy ooze of the plane. Geysers of poison erupt from the plane, in an unpredictable pattern. It is home to a significant amount of outside life capable of surviving the harsh conditions. There are scrawny trees and thorny bushes, giant venomous insects and spider, wandering trolls, dragons, and undead creatures who have wandered their way into the plane without being sucked under.

This area of the plane is small, covering only a few days' travel, but is one of the deadliest realms here. Immunity to poison is strongly recommended.

* 2d4 **giant fire beetles** devouring the body of a hill giant sinking into the mud.
* A **troll** suffocating and constantly regenerating from the toxic gas.
* 3d6 **zombies** guarding an abandoned hag's hut.
* A **green dragon** handing out *headbands of intellect* to oozes, which it then strongarms into serving it.
* A group of **bullywug**s searching for a *Sword of Sharpness* one of them lost in the swamp.
* A sentient cloud of gas, given life by the swamp, which will attempt to attack any nearby creatures.
* A wizard who has been trapped in a permanent *gaseous form* spell.
* A one hundred foot square area where 10 ft diameter geysers randomly erupt, dealing 3d8 poison damage to any creature in range that fails a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.

# Asol Varve Wet Mesa

&gt;*When stones are grand and heavy for to use*  
&gt;  
&gt;*when gravel coarse will tear and rip and rough*  
&gt;  
&gt;*when sand will scratch and run its way away*  
&gt;  
&gt;*when silt so soft will fall apart in time*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Clay is what you choose*  
&gt;  
&gt;*For building red and blues*  
&gt;  
&gt;*For taking thoughts inside your head and putting them to use*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It builds, it grows, it's true*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It's nature's art and glue*  
&gt;  
&gt;*From fertile fields and riverbeds to perfect art for you*  
&gt;  
&gt;""An Ode to Clay"" by Dilly Tuckmanor, halfling poet

&amp;#x200B;

The wet mesa is made up primarily of clay. Red clay, white clay, desert bluff clay, all sorts of consistencies and textures. Some humanoid religions believe life first originated here, and indeed life does appear here; this place has the highest concentration of earth elementals and ooze para-elementals on the plane, has been known to contain dust, mud, and magma mephits, and has even been spotted spawning out clay golems out of the mud. This was by far the first discovered area of the elemental plane of ooze, although that wasn't understood at the time; ancient shamans and early wizards would conjure clay from Asol Varve and occasionally open portals to it, and the clay would be used to make stronger hut houses, to make magical pottery and sculpture, and to fertilize the fields to grow magically prolific and healthy crops.

Don't let that fool you into letting your guard down here; it may be the closest area of the plane to the positive energy plane (despite sharing very little with other known instances of [positive-earth](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/b5bto9/the_quasielemental_plane_of_minerals/) and [positive-water](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4yev40/the_plane_of_steam_aerosol_and_mistbloods/)) but that doesn't make it any less dangerous. The clay will suck you down below as fast as any swamp ooze or Muckmire mud, and you'll be lost. The water here is still not potable, and there is still little if any edible food.

**Encounters:**

* A clay golem being formed, [in a vaguely humanoid form struggling to maintain its shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to29LvuColU), nearby a wondrous item such as a *periapt of healing* or a *amulet of health.* The clay golem will finish forming in 3d4-2 minutes. If the players have taken the magical item, it will hunt them down; if the players are still there, it will attempt to communicate with them, but it cannot speak.
* A halfling druid living on a stilted house, cultivating a few acres of [magical plants](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8kdxif/magical_plants/) in the mud.
* What appears to be an abandoned underground kobold colony/complex. All furnishings remain and nothing has been taken, and the walls/ceilings are slowly collapsing as the colony sinks into the clay.
* Any **ooze**, reflavored as living clay.
* A wizard living on the plane to research an arcane elemental ritual, whose house is floating above the swamp using magic similar to the *tenser's floating disk*.
* A large clay mound, covering up an **adult copper dragon** hiding, waiting to pounce out and startle a red troll it befriended as a friendly prank. The troll does not understand the concept of friendship, and will attack, but it is not a threat to the dragon.
* A gigantic tree, the size of a dungeon. The tree is intelligent and cannot speak, but can move its limbs, and values regains 10 hit points per round from the nutrients in the elemental mud. It is hollow, and is home to (among other things) a tribe of **vegepygmies** (VGM), an intelligent **giant wolf spider** named Gohma, and a group of **ochre jellies** each with an intelligence of 8.
* A beating heart rising up out of the clay, pumping ooze out of and back into the ground.

# Muckmire

&gt;*Ever shifting, softly weeping*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Hills of mud are slowly weaning*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Sinking quickly, bury steeply*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Hills of mud are rising sheeply*

On the border of this plane and that of Elemental Earth, are tall dunes of mud for several miles. To cross this border, you must avoid falling into the wet mud, made all the more difficult by the nature of the plane. The Ooze constantly eats away at these mud hills, eroding them down into nothing, and the Earth is constantly replacing it, building them back up. In some places, this is an eon long process, but in many the dunes are visibly ever shifting, threatening to bury you. Past the mud hills, back into the plane of Ooze, the muddy flats of Muckmire continue for nearly a day's travel with no meaningful landmarks- anything memorable has sunken into the mud long ago.

Muckmire is full of black puddings and brown slimes, and the largest population of **Ooze Para-Elementals**. They slide across the ground like a living mudslide, enveloping and smothering victims in their amorphous form.

&amp;#x200B;

***Encounters:***

* An ooze para-elemental, staying unseen for as long as possible before it strikes.
* An extremely concerned and frightened **xorn**, which followed the scent of the party's gold through the mud and ooze underground.
* A lost earth or water **elemental**. Possibly running from humanoids magically controlling or summoning it.
* The tallest spire of a long forgotten library buried beneath the mud, uncovered in front of the players by the plane of Ooze eating away at the dunes. Inside will be immense magical lore and treasure, but how will they stop the plane of Earth from covering it back up with them inside?
* A pseudodragon, whose master mage was eaten by the oozes on the plane, leaving it stranded and looking for trustworthy humanoids.
* A **White Maw** ooze (TftYP) buried just under the mud, waiting for a snack to walk on top of it. It will audibly gloat during the battle, and can be reasoned with if the party gives it something in return for their lives.
* A gargantuan mud lion coming out of the dunes, which only those of Lawful Good or Neutral Good alignment may enter to claim its treasure: an *iron flask* containing a bitter **Dao** cursed to grant three wishes. Alternatively, adventurers may sacrifice some treasure of theirs for another random treasure of equal value of the lion's choosing.
* A geyser, shooting up boiling mud filled with ooze. Once every hour, for one minute, the geyser shoots up 2d4 **grey ooze** per round, each having already lost half their maximum hit points due to fire damage from the mud. In addition, any creature who goes into the geyser will take 2d4 fire damage.

*Objects thrown into the swamp were rumored to disappear into the mud for at least a century. For that reason, powerful artifacts were occasionally thrown in the swamp by someone desperate to remove them from the multiverse for a time.*

# Survival

It is extremely difficult to survive Down Below.

You will not be able to breathe air. Nor will you be able to breathe water with the likes of *water breathing* or *Mariner's Armor.* Down Below was discovered by air genasi, which generate their own air inside their lungs, for this reason. Solutions for other humanoids include commissioning unique magic rings, modified from *rings of water breathing*, to allow breath anywhere. Alternatively, certain fey charms which maintain a solid bubble of air around your head at all times, but this is risky for a few reasons: the potential to run out if no refreshed, the immense pressures the lower you get, and placing your trust in the fey.

You will not be able to eat or drink anything you would ever desire to. Any rations you carry with you will be covered with mud and ooze just like you will. If you can ignore that and eat, be my guest, but it may be best to plan short day trips Down Below. Some use illusions to make them taste and smell still-delicious food, but many will still be severely harmed by the poison and disease in the plane.

You will probably not be able to move. This is dependent on where in the plane you decide to go Down Below, but most of the plane is too thick to be able to navigate freely. Creatures with a burrowing speed will find this hassle minimized. Otherwise, it will take a successful Athletics check to swim through the plane freely, DC from 11 to 16, due to its thickness and density.

You will not be able to see, unless you can see through mud. A warlock's *ghastly gaze* is currently the only known way to bypass this. It is recommended one gain access to tremor sense to offset this, or you will be putting yourself at an extreme constant disadvantage. Some polymorph themselves into an **earth elemental** or something like a **bulette** or **ankheg** in order to explore the plane freely, which overcomes most, if not all, of the obstacles these parts of the plane present. This works phenomenally well, as long as you are not caught deep under the mud when the polymorph ends, in which case there will be no escape for you, and no survival.

You cannot get away without immunity to acid anymore, and immunity to poison is highly recommended. Unlike up above, there is no reliable way to consistently tell where a large, living **ooze** or a damp spot of acid or poison is before you sink or swim right into it. *Black* or *Copper Dragon Scale Mail* is recommended, but expensive. There are some *rings of acid or poison resistance* more easily accessible, but immunity is strongly recommended due to the unpredictable nature of the world Down Below.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you take all of these precautions, only the strongest and most resilient adventurers have a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

# Swamp of Oblivion

Down below the great Swamp is the wettest and slimiest of the plane. The mud here is marshy and wet, and sucks you down with puckering sounds. It's easiest to swim around here (though still difficult), but far more spots of caustic ooze and acid slime waiting to eat through your skin.

It also holds the most life in the plane. Insect larva and grubs infest as much of this marsh as they can, as deep as they can, only abating in places where the oozes have devoured them. There are also larger creatures, wurms and carrion crawlers and insects burrowing through the liquid dirt. And again, you will come face to face with *lots* of **oozes**, to the point where they may be something of a constant hazard rather than a creature to fight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Treasure:**

|*Mithril Armor*|Armor made not of mithril, but out of a hard, metallic ooze. Extremely durable, but non-hostile, and far lighter than iron or steel.|
|:-|:-|
|*Spellguard Shield*|A metal shield coated in the thin remains of an antimagic slime found in the swamps.|
|*Sun blade*|A hunk of metal capable of exerting a thin line of potent acid. This weapon deals acid damage instead of radiant damage.|
|*Clothes of Mending*|A symbiotic ooze which takes the form of ordinary clothes, and naturally heals itself from rips and tears.|
|*Carpet of Flying*|Not a carpet at all, but a very large lily pad.|
|*Boots of Springing and Striding*|Boots pasted with a particularly rubbery, bouncy ooze.|
|*Ebony Fly of Wondrous Power*||
|*Slippers of Spider Climbing*|Slippers covered in a sticky ooze which clings to local services.|
|*Wand of Binding*|Causing a sticky slime to wrap around the target as if they were chains.|

&amp;#x200B;

Here are found evil artifacts, weapons and dark items meant to be sealed away forever. There are also unconfirmed tales of a cult of **Cloakers** living in an aberrant city under the mud, where they collect these evil treasures of all shapes and abilities, and may one day rise up. If they truly exist, their manor has sunken deep under the mud now, but may still be found by and adventurer who loses control, or is captured by them and brought in for questioning or something more nefarious. There is likely no escape from this fate, but no one can say for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Encounters:**

* A **cloaker**, which will wait for you to find a magical item before attacking. It knows that a player must have found away to avoid being smothered by the mud, so it will not rely on that attack; it will lean on the fact that it cannot be seen, attacking and retreating.
* A lich's phylactery, guarded by 4 **clay golems**. The phylactery is in a large ooze which acts like a *flaming sphere* spell that deals acid damage and has a 40 foot radius, which heals the golems.
* A **white maw** (TYP) which will enclose and surround the player to demand a favor from them.
* A gargantuan crocodile (use the statistics of a **behir** without the lightning breath).

# The Oubliette

The Oubliette is harder to fall down below in, as a deep delving dungeon makes up most of its space. However, if one were to sink Down Below in the swamps surrounding the Oubliette, they might find themselves blindly crawling alongside its outside walls, which continue deeper into the swamps than anyone has ever ventured. Many of the magic items and treasures scattered about this plane can be found tangled up in the mosses and mildews growing on its walls beneath the swamp, making it an ideal place to search for treasure with any sort of efficiency or direction.

However, that fame makes it a high target for monsters looking to feast on humanoids as well. Some **green hags** capable of descending Down Below will camp out in their bony vehicles, and the more intelligent oozes (such as **slithering trackers** (VGM) or, rarely, **white maws** (TftYP)) will disguise themselves as the stone of the Oubliette. At least once, an **ancient black dragon** has dove into the acid ooze to try to swim forward after submerged adventurers here, moving forward with its dragon strength and the momentum it built up from flying down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Treasure:**

|*Staff of Flowers*|A branch from an underground tree, loaded with natural magic.|
|:-|:-|
|*Amulet of Health*|A treasure used by an adventurer as defense against poison and acid, lost in the mud.|
|*Gem of Seeing*|An incredibly useful find down below, where visibility is nonexistent.|
|*Mantle of Spell Resistance*|A cloth thickly crusted with antimagic clay.|
|*Cloak of Protection*|A magical symbiotic ooze which clings to a host and shields it from harm.|
|*Pearl of Power*||
|*Sword of Wounding*|This sword generates slimey acid which it generates in the wounds that it caused.|

&amp;#x200B;

Few legendary artifacts will be found here, for those throwing them into the swamp will know to stay away, to minimize the chances of it being found. There are, however, reports of some tribes of aquatic **vegepygmies** living beneath the mud in the Oubliette's vegetation. They are warlike and dangerous, especially with the null visibility of the plane, but most adventurers who would dare to come Down Below will be equipped to handle it if these reports are true. At least one group of adventurers reports themselves to have escaped by turning the tribes on each other, implying they do not have strong relationships with each other, which may be used.

&amp;#x200B;

**Encounters:**

* 2d6 **vegepygmies,** attacking the players with stone flails. They can be talked down by some DC 20 Intimidation, or Persuasion if anyone speaks the language.
* A lost **black dragon wyrmling**, not immediately hostile to the players, very scared. It will come with the players amiably if they promise a way out of the swamp, and may even stick by their side for quite some time, but is its mother nearby?
* An antagonistic **gelatinous cube**, which will attempt to grab a player and retreat with them, knowing that it cannot be seen.
* A swarm of **stirges**, each struggling to fly or swim in the swampy mud. They will whimper and squeal like hurt animals, and if rescued will immediately turn on the players.

# Choking Smogs

This area of the plane is spotted with underground clouds of poison, and due to the minimum visibility of the plane, poison immunity is absolutely necessary for exploration down below the Choking Smogs.

This area of the plane has much of the same problems as the Swamp of Oblivion: acid pits, subterranean creatures, and thick wet mud. They are less of a problem than in that region of the plane, but must be taken into account. Even the mud and ooze which isn't life-threateningly acidic is toxic and biting to the touch.

&amp;#x200B;

**Treasure:**

|*Dagger of Venom*|A lost adventurer's weapon, now inundated with the plane's poisons.|
|:-|:-|
|*Vicious Weapon*|A weapon inundated with the smog, now biting and caustic in its strikes.|
|*Periapt of Proof Against Poison*|Likely brought to the plane to resist the choking smogs. It was not enough.|
|*Wand of Fireballs*|A branch taken from a scraggly tree planted and grown in the smogs. It deals poison damage instead of fire damage, emitting large clouds of toxic gas within range.|
|*Staff of Swarming insects*|Biting swarms of toxic flies.|
|*Necklace of Fireballs*|Deals acid damage instead of fire.|
|*Pipes of the Sewers*||
|*Cloak of Elvenkind*|A symbiotic slime which clings to its host and refracts light to shield it from view.|

Less exploration has been done in this corner of the plane, the only legendary artifact having been recovered so far being *Zhudun's Lampost*, capable of stopping and turning back time, for the individual or for the universe. Upon discovery, it was immediately thrown back into the swamp by one Jace Kordovsky, who was executed for this action. It has not been found again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Encounters**:

* A **revenant**, who was buried in the mud, who will try to use the players to get out of the mud and pursue the sahuagin that threw it in.
* 4d6 **zombies** and 2d4 **wights**, or 3d6 **ghouls** and 2d6 **ghasts**, having been spawned in the mud to guard some hidden artifact or some lich's phylactery.
* A **couatl**, who was captured and thrown into the mud long ago by an enemy of its god. It will reward the players extremely handsomely if it is rescued and allowed to finish its ancient divine mission, even more so if they assist it in doing so.
* The corpse of a dead hill giant, now infested with 2d4 **carrion crawlers**, still with all of its belongings and treasure in life.

# Avol Varve Wet Mesa

The clay here is warm to the touch, enveloping you like a heated blanket or a shirt right out of the dryer. The water and earth are more separated here, with chunks of dried clay/sand you'll need to dig through next to underground bubbles/ponds of water, but the majority is still wet, sinking, and muddy. The oozes here are generally less toxic than those found elsewhere in the plane, but caution still must be taken. There is a high population of elementals.

&amp;#x200B;

**Treasure:**

|*3d6 Beads of Nourishment*|Small pebbles soaked in the plane's nourishing clay.|
|:-|:-|
|*Alchemy Jug*|A ceramic jar full of elemental ooze, capable of parsing, splitting, or transmuting it into usable fluids.|
|*Dust of Dryness*|Found somewhat commonly around the clay particles, it is most often found already having absorbed water, and ready to expel it.|
|*Keoghtom's Ointment*|A jewelry box full of nourishing clay from the plane, ready to be applied to the skin.|
|*Marble Elephant of Wondrous Power*||
|*Back of Tricks*|This bag summons small slimes, oozes, and molds with the same stats as the beasts they ordinarily summon.|
|*Dust of Sneezing and Choking*|Particles of clay|

&amp;#x200B;

This area of the plane is where the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*  was recovered, as well as *Magorium,* the Lance of Wonder. Generally speaking, more heroic artifacts find their way to this area of the plane. However, that can attract unwanted attention; besides the clay golems wandering this plane, there are reports of a tribe of sentient **bullettes** here, waiting for heroic adventurers to find these artifacts and swiping them from their hands. They are very likely being controlled by or working for whatever druid or mage awakened them, and it is unknown for what purpose, good or evil, they are working towards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Encounters:**

* 1d4 **bullettes**, each with Intelligence of 10, who will stay out of range of the players until they find a powerful artifact, in which case they will attack immediately with all their strength in order to steal the item.
* A **black pudding** which has somehow been given an Intelligence of 12 and the ability to speak common, and is having an existential crisis.
* A very large slime which heals creatures instead of dealing acid damage, except that if the characters are already at full health or reach full health while inside, it will begin dealing acid damage until they are knocked unconscious, at which point it will begin healing them again.
* A **homunculus** which was sent by some mage to sit in the mud and wait for adventurers in order to give them an important message about some nefarious events on the material plane , and give them a quest about it. This information may be an important revelation about the world in your campaign, or it may be information from hundreds or thousands of years ago which is no longer correct or relevant.

# Muckmire

Below the mud hills near the elemental Earth is some of the thickest, densest, toughest mud ooze anywhere down below the plane. Only the strongest can move themselves with any real agency, making this the most common place of drowning in the elemental Ooze. However, its proximity to elemental Earth also makes it one of the easiest places to drop unwanted treasures, or even entire structures, making it one of the most potentially rewarding places to dive.

Once, a gnomish barbarian who decided to descend into the mud hills sunk into the mud for more than 24 straight hours before finding an entire abandoned Dao cathedral the size of a city. He spent almost a week underground collecting lore and treasure and fighting a few stray elementals, before being found by the isolationist Dao who were still living there and sold to Efreeti. Two fellow adventurers had followed after him to find where he'd gone; one became so claustrophobic and gripped with fear that they teleported out after 12 hours of sinking, and the other supposedly sunk for nearly a week before they starved.

&amp;#x200B;

**Treasure:**

|*Decanter of Endless Water*|This decanter does not produce water, but produces either slimey ooze, or sloshing mud, depending on where in the plane it is found.|
|:-|:-|
|*Dust of Disappearance*|Not a dust, but rather a thick mud one must slather across their skin.|
|*Beads of Force*|These beads create solid spheres of translucent mud.|
|*Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments*|The various magical paints found in the set can be found scattered throughout the deep mud here in significant quantities.|
|*Necklace of Adaptation*|An extremely valuable find for survival in the plane. Often found on the submerged corpses of adventurers for whom it was not enough.|
|*Bag of Beans*|A bag of clumps of hardened mud which, when buried, will sprout into giant columns of mud.|
|*Wand of Web*|This wand conjures a massive clump of thick mud to clamp creatures in place.|

&amp;#x200B;

This realm is full of great manors, castles, and libraries from the elemental plane of Earth, sunken here intentionally or by some tragedy. The aforementioned Dao are a common group; **arcanoloths** have been reported somewhat commonly; there has been at least one report of human **archmage**s, studying the plane, gathering artifacts, and possibly seeking to become a **lich.** Possibly more troubling, reports have been made of a gigantic creature, the size of a mountain, burrowing in the mud, whose breathing can be heard for miles. More research and careful exploration must be done to confirm these sighting, but if there is any chance the **Tarrasque** may be slumbering in this plane, we must shift our efforts dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

**Encounters:**

* The entrance, be it window or front door or otherwise, of a dungeon. Perhaps a Dao's castle, an Arcanoloth's library, or a mage's laboratory, or anything else you have a really good idea about, as long as it's an entire dungeon submerged in the mud.
* A few yugoloth scouts who must decide whether to capture you or kill you, and may consult you on the decision.

It is not in good faith of me to recommend an excursion under the plane, with no food, no light, no air. However, I feel it is my duty to inform you where the real heart of the plane lies, should you choose to make an expedition here in search of some grand lost artifact or treasure. There is nothing for you on the surface. Down Below is harsh and uninhabitable; the surface of the plane is also harsh and uninhabitable, and while it is certainly less so, there is little to no reward. If you delve into the swamp depths, you never know what you may find.

I've been working on this name generator for a long while in order to bring more flavour to the names and languages of the Forgotten Realms.

The main idea was to make everything sound less tropey and more like serious conlangs. I will expand on any language if asked, but I felt these were the more intriguing and major ones to explain:

**Common** - the esperanto of Faerûn, it combines simple words and syntax to make an unpolished if usable lingua franca, with germano-czech sonorities and only rarely more than bisyllabic words. *Amelangen ir omhen lor ovos ve Pelcrum ke Til ir ze robimeser Zeli ze Amel o Tupcrum*    
**Elvish** - an elven language, it flows and syncopates a lot when spoken, and uses a lot of liquid sounds to seem like running water. It's unique in having a trial person, since three is an important number. Extremely strange is its humble VOS system. *Puraith velyth tra thin kelu melain ele maetenlahr shen din aer mathrenas ele ruanth Karsunele, lahrunithte karafaev ele tor celythoran eteüan te rivaro.*

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,37,"# The Wanderer

The Wanderer Druid is one who's home territory has been destroyed or corrupted beyond salvage, or who has been forced to leave - either through exile or self-exile. This is sometimes related to the Druidic Order itself, and so some Wanderers become cut-off from the resources and allies provided by the organization. In rare cases, the Druid chooses to leave an intact region and travel the world for reasons or goals that are their own design (or the designs of Deities or others).

Wanderers sometimes find new homes, but most do not - they are ""itenerant Druids"", who walk the lands and try to restore the Balance where they can. They are forced to learn new survival techniques, new species of plants, animals, and creatures, new humanoid cultures, and new ways of dealing with them diplomatically (or through violence). The Wanderer is a much more well-rounded and dangerous opponent, but lacks the affinity of the land where they first were called to the role. 

Wanderer Druids have much broader choices when it comes to Wildshaping, as they have been exposed to a larger variety of wildlife. They do not spend long enough in any one area to use their Proficiency bonus with any ""Druid"" skills, like Nature or Survival, however, outside of their ""original"" terrain. However, if they spend at least 1 year in a new terrain, this restriction is lifted.

Wanderers rarely make long-term allies, as their travels do not frequently return them to the same areas, but this is not always the case. Short-term allies are abundant, however, as the Druid tries to work with the locals to solve problems rather than trying to do so alone (as most Wanderers no longer interact with the larger Druid community in most cases). Sometimes, however, the Wanderer comes into contct with other Druids, and these newcomers mostly respect their wisdom as they have seen more things work and fail than most of the current Druid Order, but this is not always the case, as some see the Wanderer as uncommited, unable to form a ""true"" bond with the land. Ideological clashes can escalate into larger problems if diplomacy and cooler heads do not prevail. 

Wanderers sometimes attach themselves to species, and migrate with them - butterflies, elk, wildebeests, sparrows, whales - any creature that travels great distances could attract a Wanderer, who ensures that the species survives in the case of great calamity, otherwise, the Wanderer lets Nature take its course. Some wanderers chase natural phenomenon instead of animals, like storms, or tornadoes, and try and mitigate the damage caused by such destruction. 

Some Wanderers leave their home territory at the behest of the gods, the Order, or some innate need to seek change. These Druids establish a new home elsewhere, and strive to protect it as best as they can (oftentimes becoming Guardian Druids). Not all Wanderers wander forever. 

# NPC Examples

* **Telleck Unwin**: This Druid was exiled by the Order for neglecting to protect their charge - an ancient artifact that was stolen. Formerly a Guardian, now a Wanderer, the Druid is filled with bitterness and wanders the new terrains with hardly a glance up from their feet. If met, the Druid will rail against the Order and will give false info/directions if asked. If not met, this Druid will attempt to destabilize any and all ecosystems that seem like they are being tended by other members of the Order.

* **Ikshir Barook**: This Druid travels mostly as migratory bird species, traversing the world during the seasonal flights. The Druid is fiercely protective of the flocks, and will attack any creature that harms one of its charges. On rare occassions the Druid will wander in its natural form, and hunts for injured birds to heal and tend. If pressed, it will change into a raptor-type avian. 

* **Janwin Dredge**: This Druid follows the seasonal path of tornadoes and attempts to repair the damage left in their wake. They are allied with many members of communities that lie in the natural path of these seasonal phenomenon and are well-regarded as a caring, hardworking individual. In times of stress, they have a quick-temper and have no use for slackers or those who would exploit those in need.

# Plot Hooks

* The Party meets a Wanderer Druid who is following an annual migration of large deer-types (Elk, Moose, etc...), who is happy to travel with them as long as they are going the direction of the herd. The Wanderer can offer a lot of information about where they have been in the recent past, and pass along any other news or rumors. At times, the Druid disappears from the company of the Party, and travels as part of the herd in wildshape. 
* A group of Druids are chasing a renegade Wanderer Druid, whom they accuse of destroying their grove and murdering their fellow Druids (partially true). The group will be quite forceful in demanding information from the Party and/or local populace. The Wanderer is hiding among them as a local animal, watching and listening. If given the opportunity, the Wanderer will attempt to kill the posse. 
* A Druid is trapped in a bog and is calling out for help. If assisted, the Druid claims that they are lost and are seeking a local landmark, where they plan to establish a new home. If questioned, the Druid will reveal that they left their homeland because of a terrible event/enemy, and that this peril is following them. The claim is true, and in only a few weeks, will arrive in the area. 
* A local area is being hit with an unusual amount of storms. A Druid is calling these, tired of the locals interference in the ecosystem, and hopes to drive them out. If confronted, the Druid will fight fiercely, but flee if overwhelmed. If approached diplomatically, the Druid will reveal a deep emotional wound after their home territory was nearly destroyed by humanoid greed, and this is simply revenge. 
* A Wanderer is in the area, clearing a forest of the undergrowth and destroying a large presence of predators in preparation of a new standing circle of stones to be erected, thus adding to the Order's power. The Druid will not take kindly to visitors or travelers, and will force trespassers to leave as quickly as possible, calling upon many animal allies to do so if necessary. The circle will take 10 years to construct. 
* A group of unassociated Druids have been tasked to Wander to a region where humanoids are growing exponentially and the land cannot support them. Their charge is to stabilize the ecosystem - by helping reinvigorate the land or by culling the population (or convincing many to leave), the choice is theirs.

8. **Greasy Balls (7,500gp).** *A pair of large, greasy balls (requires attunement).* Any surface the greasy balls are rubbed over becomes slick, as though Grease were cast. (Save DC = 8 + user’s Wis mod + proficiency bonus.) 
9. **Cheese of Engorgement (8,000gp).** *A waxed wheel of cheese.* When a portion of the cheese is consumed, the eater grows by one size category for the next 1d8 days. The wheel contains 10 portions, effects are stackable.
10. **Pot of Rude Awakening (8,500gp).** *A metal cooking pot.* When struck three times, the cooking pot wakes all creatures within 120 ft (including those in a magically-induced sleep). Any creatures woken this way who are not allied with the user must roll a d20. On a 1-2 they become hostile towards the user. 
11. **Hat of Clumsy Charisma (11,000gp).** *An attractive but bulky hat.* Once placed on a creature's head, the hat permanently reduces the wearer’s dexterity score by 1, and increases their charisma score by 1. Repeat uses possible.
12. **Liar Lyre (12,000gp).** *A well-polished lyre with golden pegs (requires attunement and proficiency with a lyre).* Whilst being played well, the lyre prevents any creature who can hear its music from saying something they know to be untruthful.
13. **Quivering Quiver (15,000gp).** *A silently vibrating leather quiver (requires attunement).* Any arrows that are placed into the quiver for 24 hours or more become magical, and deal magical damage.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,2,35,"**Background**

The Nahar is a region and setting inspired by ancient Mesopotamia. So far I have focused mainly on the gods and cosmology of the world and less on the people who inhabit it. A while back I posted about [aasimar](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/aaejv5/aasimar_heirs_to_the_divine/) in this universe, but left out tieflings. This is because I did not have many ideas for tieflings yet and did not want them to come out as simplistic “anti-aasimar.” I realized I was missing an opportunity to add a race to my setting while also expanding the details of the rest of the world. (I am not a linear thinker; I like to branch out from different starting points.) 

—

**Physical appearances**

What we know as the “tiefling” is actually a label for mortals with a diverse array of links to the demons of the Underworld. To make matters more confusing, there is little correlation between the source of a tiefling’s condition (if known) and the racial characteristics they inherit. 

Just as as demons’ bodies are a conglomeration of the body parts of various animals, so too do tieflings have unique animalistic characteristics. The tiefling has, at the very least, some degree of facial and perhaps other [resemblance to a certain animal(s).](https://www.amusingplanet.com/2016/07/17th-century-sketches-comparing-human.html) It is believed that the most common animal resemblances are owls, lions, eagles, and horned beasts (namely bulls, goats, and rams), but other forms are not unheard of. Other traits associated with animal resemblances include talon of hoof-like feet, sharp teeth, patches of downy feathers, long tails, and skin color resembling that of an animal. These traits may be seen as disturbing or mysterious, and are often bullied as children. Depending on their appearances, some tieflings may be taught by their parents to present themselves as mortals with congenital deformity and/or related cognitive disability - an act that is difficult to maintain, given the keenness characteristic of the tiefling psyche. On the other hand, non-tiefling children with similar conditions are sometimes assumed to be tieflings, and treated accordingly. 

**Origins**

Unlike other races, tieflings do not “breed true.” In fact, most are infertile, and as for those who are not, none of their traits appear to be heritable by children they biologically birth or sire anyway. Thus, some researchers do not consider tieflings a true race. This discovery showed that the tiefling condition does not spontaneously appear in bloodlines in the same manner as aasimar do, but through outside influences. These influences are always the result of some interaction between mortal and demon. Demons can act in many ways, but must be invited in some way into the mortal’s body. Some examples include, but are not limited to: 

* A powerful magic-caster seals a demon into the body of a fetus or newborn. The child develops more and more tiefling physical characteristics as they age, and has a personality mostly the same as their mortal counterparts. However, they are forced to struggle with the whispers of the demon trapped within them. 

* A couple has made many attempts at children, but to no avail: all are born stillborn. No cures, spells, or exorcisms have helped the poor family. Before coitus or and/or during pregnancy, the desperate mother beseeches the demons of the underworld to not kill her child, but to ensure that it lives and thrives. The resulting tiefling child, similarly inhabited by a new demonic “soul,” is born healthy, but eventually the other demons will return, seeking to “collect” what they have created and loaned. 

The origins and outcomes of the tiefling condition are diverse and vast. Less educated mortals are more likely to make generalizations about a given tiefling’s origin than ones more familiar with demons and/or racially diverse communities. Tieflings have the same range of personalities and alignments as any other mortal. Not all the demons associated with them are evil. Some demons have a tendency towards good, and are known to assist priests in exorcisms of evil demons. 

**Society and Psychology**

Tieflings occupy a liminal place in society as far as stigma is concerned. Some tieflings and their parents are loathed for their creation, whereas others are well-acquainted with their communities and do not face so much condemnation. Because tieflings are so strongly associated with birth, in some places they are considered symbols of fertility. Seeing one is considered good luck for new or expectant couples, and it is not unusual for tiefling to be approached for a blessing. 

The psychological outcomes of the tiefling child depends largely on their reception by their parents. Some who prayed for a child are more accepting of their demon-touched offspring, whereas those who were unaware of the consequences are usually shocked and disgusted by the result of their rituals. Those children who are not immediately given away or, gods for bid, abandoned nevertheless wonder how they are related to their parents. But unlike some neighboring regions, all peoples indigenous to the Nahar strongly condemn infanticide, and people who encounter abandoned children are morally obligated to care for them or give them to a family who can. Therefore, many tiefling children end up in accepting and nurturing families, and are more stigmatized by non-family members. These tieflings often grow to be close to the families, tribes, houses, and other organizations that raised them. Tieflings generally make strange acquaintances but loyal friends. Whether eager to serve, defend, or avenge their families and friends, or to take up some other cause, answer the call of the adventurer.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,21,413,"The effects of positive energy and negative energy are poorly understood. It is well known that positive energy is the source of healing magic and divine protection, as negative energy is the source of undead and some disease. It is known amongst the well read that the upper planes of the astral sea are powered by positive energy, and the lower planes by negative. What is poorly understood is the nature of the relationship between these kinds of energy, and between certain other kinds of magic. For instance, the quasi-elemental planes: negative energy seems to take away that native element, leaving behind a sort of residue; e.g. fire-negative yields soot, air-negative yields a vacuum. Positive energy, on the other hand, seems to be intuitive, but with no obvious explanation; fire-positive yields searing radiance, air-positive yields lightning and electricity. We recovered the following excerpt from a failed expedition into the [earth-positive plane](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CYNC_dUNg44/V25mEDf7VxI/AAAAAAAAI1Q/ggpzkl8IyAUIj34Q_Os_P1DiAoy4xAutwCLcB/s1600/Cave%2Bof%2BCrystals%2B-Giant%2BCrystal%2BCave-amazing%2Bgeologist.jpg), c. 300 P.C., which sailed across the eastern sea to the [Honoradus Mountains](http://www.westcoastplacer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DiavikMine.jpg), across which was found to be an open portal to the plane, in a deep ravine coming down from the tallest mount:

&gt;It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the earth-positive plane—with its vast treasure-hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient tunnels—and I am the more reluctant because my warning will likely be in vain. Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable. It is against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist my object in leading the Maglubiyan University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the earth-positive plane, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Prof. Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this; but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection, as is the nature of positive energy.

This essay went on to vaguely elaborate on the various threats of the plane, as the author recounted their expedition and the deaths of their men, of which themself and only a single graduate assistant survived. The horrors recounted here were nearly beyond comprehension to humanoids at the time. However, as the author anticipated, this only led to new and increased interest in such a plane, due to the key detail revealed by the hobgoblin expedition:

&amp;#x200B;

[The entire plane is constructed of an infinite expanse of precious gems](http://pre15.deviantart.net/9b8b/th/pre/f/2010/343/1/0/10cce309305635f05048605435d951d6-d34ip8i.jpg), free to be taken.

&amp;#x200B;

I write not with the intention of dissuading those reading from seeking their way into the plane, although I certainly encourage such a dissuasion, for I fully expect I cannot convince any would-be lords or ladies from throwing themselves to their dooms. I write merely with the hope that with a full education and understanding of the threats, one less future adventurer might fail to properly equip and prepare themselves for the intense dangers of this realm of treasure.

# The Treasure

It is now somewhat common knowledge amongst scholars, lords, and a certain class of heroes, that the earth-positive quasi-elemental plane is that of Minerals, made primarily of pure inorganic materials naturally arranged in a regular crystalline lattice pattern. This, to the doom of many an adventurer, includes gems such as diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. It also includes certain mineraloids such as opal, obsidian, and jet.

This sort of mineral is most found in the realm of [Kristalgeld](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0e/21/7b/0e217be4dd10fc82179d47c4f7c24c0c.jpg); this realm makes up the majority of our exploration into the plane. The general consensus among scholars is that Kristalgeld makes up only a minority of the plane, but it is the vast majority of how much we have explored. Though discovered by hobgoblins, orcs pushed the initial wave of pioneering in this realm, bringing home immense wealth for König Ongufor and their tribes. Before long, all humanoids had some amount of resources dedicated to bringing back treasure from here.

The most efficient way to bore into the plane here is earth magic, but some more advanced races (especially humans and dwarves) bring [mechanical drills and mining machines.](http://www.sro.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/mining-000013d.jpg) Bags of holding are imperative for efficient exploration on this plane, as even a few feet of excavation will be enough to easily fill a normal backpack. Areas closest to the known entrances of this plane are usually wide, open caverns, where hundreds of parties before have excavated. These caverns are still lined with more treasures to be taken, but further into the plane are smaller and smaller tunnels and tendrils through the rock, where fewer and fewer humanoids have been before. The vast majority of untouched places, however, will be tunnels you drill yourselves, as nearly all other pockets of air here are the result of some treasure-seekers before you taking that treasure.

Often the most damning danger of excursions into Kristalgeld is that many of the crystal gems here are still filled with latent positive energy. If one is careful, this is a great boon, as positive energy is a strong force of healing, as or more valuable than healing potions. However, many of these gems contain singularities of positive-dominant energy, and will over-heal its holder until their body unravels. Sometimes, these effects are latent, and manifest days or weeks after being removed from the plain, and these coins are responsible for dozens of deaths in the early days of exploration. This is easily avoidable through a simple identify spell, but this slows down exploration immensely, which cannot be afforded. Some adventurers get around this by storing their recovered treasure for no less than two months, at which point the positive properties will be apparent.

When all charges have been expended, the gem of healing becomes an ordinary diamond, emerald, sapphire, or ruby.|Also known as [positive-minor gems](https://www.gemsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LightoftheDesert.jpg)|

# Survival

Exploring this plane is somewhat straightforward compared to many of the other elemental planes, in that it is hardly different from exploring underground in the material world, easier by virtue of being sideways rather than down. All the normal considerations apply: pack enough food and water; you will not find any during your journeys, so bring twice as much as you plan on needing. Don't accidentally cut yourself off from air as you explore, either.

The primary obstacle of the plane is, intuitively ,the minerals, growing in hard lattice structures. These crystals are extremely sharp and pointed, with thin peaks, and jagged corners. Traversing in the plane requires thick gloves, boots, and pants, but they are generally insufficient against a hard blow. Walking through this plane will inflict 1d6 piercing damage for every ten feet traveled, unless it is treated as extremely difficult terrain, requiring three feet of movement for every one foot traveled. Even then, taking the dash action requires a DC 10 acrobatics check to avoid taking 2d6 piercing damage, and falling prone (or being pressed against the walls, such as by the *gust of wind* spell) deals 3d6 slashing damage. Armor of Invulnerability to Piercing is strongly recommended against; movement will be easier, but you double the risk of slashing damage from the walls and the floor.

The most effective work-around to this problem is some flying ability. Much as with exploration into the elemental plane of air and related planes, the spell *fly* is not a good solution due to its short-term nature and resource-intensiveness. Magic items such as rings, boots, brooms, and wings of flying are the best bet, but one must be sure to get modifications or versions with a hovering speed as well for long-term mining operations. Movement in this way is generally considered to be more difficult than the planes of air, as species such as aarokocra with natural flight, cannot naturally hover in the plane.

Even if you obtain some method of flight, navigating the thin corridors, completing mining operations, and avoiding touching anything is a less-than-ideal situation. So the solution is perhaps the hardest one for most adventurers today: take it slow. Don't rush, be extremely careful and aware of your surrounding, and avoid any kind of conflict or situation where haste becomes necessary.

This is easier said than done.

# Alleh-Fallig

The ""Heysherik of the Safeyer,"" as they are called by terran genasi, are known to themselves and most humanoids scholars as the [Alleh-Fallig](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sqqv7gjNMk0/V8r8dmSSeSI/AAAAAAAACQ4/2izqOr0ZCOwTCpbAnBPlgEkTdpcS_GgKgCLcB/s1600/profile_picture_by_crystal_mantis-d92i92c.jpg). The are a species of warrior elementals. They appear as large humanoid bees, locusts, or preying mantises, made of a lattice of inorganic crystals.

Crystal elementals, as well as other kinds of earth elementals, have been spotted here, but Alleh-Fallig are the only known civilization (and there for political worry) on the plane. They are individually ferocious, uniformly aggressive, and territorial of the treasure; One of the primary reasons expeditions have slowed somewhat in recent times is the discovery of the primary material portal to the plane by Safeyeran scouts, and thus the constant presence of a guard stationed in that area. Other ways to reach the plane, such as artificial portals, are now being utilized.

Only the Dao are known to freely mine from the plane of minerals, as all other parties are quickly hunted down and extinguished by the Alleh-Fallig, who refuse to allow other creatures to remove precious gems or other crystals alike from the premises of the plane. It is unknown how the Dao have managed to secure a strong relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

The city of Safeyer has never been visited by a mortal, but mental magics on captured Alleh-Fallig have revealed some information about the place. It appears to be the only mineral city, although there are many outposts and fortresses. It is said to be a grand city with a towering spire, where the queen of the Heysherik reigns, and its warriors flock from to protect and preserve the austerity and ecology of their native plane.

The Safeyerans (which comprises all known Alleh-Fallig) seem to consider crystal structure to be life, much like we do nature. They revere certain larger crystals, treat gemstones as pets rather than property, and consider disturbing the sanctity of a mine to be the same as uprooting a forest or razing a hillside. These elemental minerals view inanimate minerals in the same way that we as mortals view lesser forms of organic life, and it shouldn't be difficult to empathize with them. I tell you this not to persuade you to abandon this foolish endeavor, as I know that I cannot, but I merely to plead with you to understand, not to hate the elementals which attempt to ""steal"" your hard-earned treasure; they do not do so out of greed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*You think you own whatever gems you walk on*  
&gt;  
&gt;*These crystals are just dead things you can claim*  
&gt;  
&gt;*But I know every quartz, and gem, and sapphire*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Has a life, has a spirit, has a name*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Have you ever heard the sapphire sing a cold blue tune,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*or asked the swimming rubies where she swims?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Can you sing with all the emeralds in these gardens?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Can you paint with all the colors of the gems?*  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Written in a brief spell of focus by an enchantress mage after melding with the mind of a mineral elemental

&amp;#x200B;

# Crystal Life

I will try to cover these next sections briefly, because (not being a way to make money) I know it does not concern you. However, I feel as though I must explain them, as they make up a majority of this plane of existence; the first of them is, **Maddniey-Hayyah,** the Realm of Growth.

This realm is structured quite differently to the realm of Kristelgeld, as the minerals found here are of more common kinds, such as quartz and calcite. What makes this place special is how the positive energy really infuses itself into the stone; gems of healing are, many believe, fully alive. Not alive in the same way as you or me, to be sure, but they reproduce, grow, and respond to their surroundings. They are equivalent to elementals, except plants instead of beasts, creating ever-changing forests of mineral and stone.

This realm has the widest diversity of more traditional elementals, as well, taking both traditional amorphous forms and the shapes of small beasts.

Alleh-Fallig found here are equally territorial against outsiders, but generally seem to be less immediately aggressive or combat ready, reverently wandering the crystal growths.

&amp;#x200B;

# Sapphire Realm

Exploration into **Al-Azirqa** has yielded mixed results. The minerals here do not exactly seem alive in the same way as those of the Realm of Growth, but they shift and flow around themselves, much like a fluid does. The terrain here approximates some material-plane terrain, such as waterfalls, rivers, and springs, appearing like jeweled oases. Be warned, if you by chance stumble upon one of these oases, what appears to be water is sapphires, just as deadly sharp as all the other minerals of the plane and offering no respite to your thirst if you've run out of supplies. 

The sapphires here have been found to be usable in place of holy water in many divine rituals. It offers zero practical benefit to do so, but it's thematic, and more importantly some scholars believe there may be some potential to combine some of these holy rituals with arcane rituals of elemental earth using these materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Ruby Realm

The minerals found in **Al-Alhamra** glow a soft ever-shifting red, like dying embers in the wake of a fire. However, they are not hot to the touch, and hold no arcane resemblance to fire (elemental or otherwise); instead, they act as a powerful numbing agent if applied in the same way holy water often is. When these minerals are applied careful to a part of the body, and pierced just under the skin, the immediate area of the body around the puncture quickly falls numb for 1d4 x 30 minutes. This makes exploration into this realm extremely dangerous, and not recommended, but these minerals are extremely valuable for shamanistic and medical purposes.

Alleh-Fallig warriors have been reported to ingest chunks of these rubies before going into battle, plausibly gaining soe further resolve from the inability to feel pain. Ingesting a mineral in this way would kill a humanoid, but there may be a way to harness the power of these gems in a more usable fashion

&amp;#x200B;

# Emerald Realm

There is no gravity in **Al-Alkhadra.** The ability to fly is absolutely necessary to explore this realm, as pushing off the walls for locomotion will quickly rip you to shreds. The caves of this plane are arranged in distinct tunnels with few branching paths, and the emeralds that make them up are prone to jut out at passers-by. Little else is recorded about this plane, and many believe these tunnels lead directly to the mythical city of Safeyer, where the Alleh-Fallig reign. It is recommended you avoid these areas. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Obsidian Realm

The minerals of **Al-Alsawda** were believed to be very close to the negative energy plane, puzzling scholars for some time due to their presence in a positive quasi-elemental plane. The reasons for this was that this obsidian absorbs any light that is brought near, creating large areas of darkness. However, this light is not gone or destroyed; it is merely stored. A cave made up of this obsidian twinkles like the night sky with the signs of the light still stored within these stones, and with the right push (or when too much light has been absorbed) the obsidian will expel the stored light in a brilliant flash, blinding nearby creatures. These caverns are beautiful, but dangerous for this reason if you are carrying torches or utilizing the *light* cantrip or a similar spell.

These rocks are used as weapons by the Alleh-Fallig, firstly creating regions of darkness for stealth and intimidation, and secondly for use as flash grenades against unsuspecting invaders. This tool use was one of the first indications of the Alleh-Fallig as thinking, feeling creatures. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Night Stone. *Wondrous item, rare.*|This small stone emits darkness in a 10 ft radius around it. Completely covering the night stone with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. As an action, if you are holding the night stone in your hand, you can speak the command word and cause it to burst with light. Each creature within 30 ft that can see you must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, being blinded for one minute on a failed save. The target may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save. This flash happens automatically if the night stone is uncovered and in the area of a *daylight* spell or similar magical effect; if the flash happens in this way, you must also make the saving throw.|

|Night Stone Armor. *Armor (any kind), legendary.*|This armor is inlaid with obsidian from the quasi-elemental plane of minerals. While wearing this armor, you emit darkness as if you were the target of the *darkness* spell. Once per day, you can use your actions to create a burst of light, causing each creature that can see you within 60 ft to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, becoming blinded for one minute on a failed save. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a successful save. This flash happens automatically if you are in the effects of a *daylight* spell or a similar spell or magical effect; if this event triggers in this way, you must also make the saving throw. |

&amp;#x200B;

# Opal Realm

The land of **Al-Bayda** glistens ethereally with iridescent colors, and is the realm of this plane closest to the Astral Sea. The minerals here are not as sharp as the rest of the plane, and regular movement here is not difficult; there are also no recorded instances of the Great Problem of this plane, as explained below. These features make the opal realm the most hospitable area of the plane, and an excellent base of operations for further exploration into Kristalgeld. 

However, for a reason yet to be discovered, no mage has been able to open a portal directly to this realm. This means that the only way to reach this area to set up something like a base of operations is to travel to the Astral Plane and find a natural portal to this realm, which has [its own host of problems.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4z83am/the_astral_plane_the_githyanki_and_tunarath_their/) So reasonable expedition into this plane remains unfeasible until the reasons behind this plane-shifting block are uncovered and dealt with.

# The Great Problem

&gt;...As I have elaborated on before, I...chose to accompany this expedition out of aching, morbid curiosity due to the loss of that dear friend in a similar \[expedition\] some years past. We assumed we would come across the monster that slew him and his party, and would take it down ourselves in righteous anger, and all would be avenged as we plundered its tomb...It began to appear as though no vengeance could be found...  
&gt;  
&gt;...Across that chasm, we saw some signs of life. Tents, bags, mess kits and gas cannisters around a long-empty fire ring. But no people...Inside the tent, now, I could see some sillouette on the other side of the bed. It was motionless, staring right at me, seemingly waiting for me to make a certain move. Shivering, I brought up the torch, to shine a light on it, and the terrified face of my dear friend screamed silently back at me. But it wasn't them, not really; it was their likeness of body, grown organically of crystal material. I had never heard of a medusa which turned bodies to diamond instead of stone, but it was far from unbelievable, and I ran back to warn my crew of the danger. We would have justice at last!...  
&gt;  
&gt;...After the third hour, we agreed that the mineral medusa was not coming, and set out to track it down. Shortly after this, we each began to feel a distinct sickness of stomach, and many of us a splitting headache. The walls gradually began to vibrate, until they sung with a cacophonous orchestra of single note chimes, and then the captain of our party began to crystallize- he had looked into the medusa's gaze! She had been hear the whole time, and possessed a sort of sonic screech! I covered my eyes, but knew I could not fight unless I knew where she was, so I stayed still. I began to hear cry after cry from allies, whom I know must have understood to cover their eyes against the threat, but were taken nonetheless. Until, eventually, another member of the party squeezed our only bloodstone into my hands, as I felt his skin become stone, and he said in an increasingly difficult manner ""tell them what happened here."" To this day, I'm not sure that I know.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one aspect of this plane, and how the positive energy interacts with that of the elemental earth, that should be most concerning to prospective prospectors, is known as the great problem. It is not the sharpness or the difficulty of movement, it is not the question of ""curses"" of sorts on one's treasure, and it is not even attacks by great elemental mineral warrior-insects.

&amp;#x200B;

It is the tendency of the plane to turn everyone on it to glass.

&amp;#x200B;

The above excerpt is taken from the journals of Cylia Hardin, a former explorer who wrote prolifically to dissuade further exploration into the plane after personally experiencing the Great Problem.

When early expeditions did not return, most assumed that they fell victim to the blades, or the inhabitants of the plane. Even for more experienced adventurers, there was always the possibility of getting lost and running out of water or food. However, it is speculated, in many of those cases something far more unavoidable and sinister was occurring. It is believed that this is what has happened to the parties described in the excerpt near the beginning of this essay. **For every 24 hours spent on the quasi-elemental plane of minerals, a creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be petrified, turned into minerals.**

To date, there is no good way to avoid this fate. It is not safe for anyone but the toughest of barbarians to stay time on the plane, for while it may not be difficult to avoid the first wave, nearly everyone will fail eventually.

Some wizards and scholars have developed charms and amulets which give some level of resistance to transmutation, and to flesh-to-stone effects. Such charms that ward off a medusa's or a basilisk's petrifying gaze are indeed effective at preventing the Great Problem of this plane, but are difficult to obtain- both monetarily, and in finding a wizard both capable and willing to create one for you. If such charms are not a problem for you, then you should acquire them. Otherwise, it is **strongly** recommended you do not stay in the plane overnight. If it is absolutely necessary to do so, then you accept the risk of the Great Problem, and should still seek to minimize the time spent on this plane.

&amp;#x200B;

# Encounters

For each hour spent on the quasi-elemental plane of minerals, roll a d12. On an 11, roll a d6 on the following table:

1. **1d6 Mineral Mephits** *Use the* ***ice mephit*** *stat block, but replace all instances of ""cold"" with ""piercing,"" and remove the vulnerability to fire. They generally want to drive out player characters, via tricks/taunts or pestering them, but do not fight to kill.*
2. **Earth Elemental**  *Earth elementals here are often found in a state of reverence, or confusion. They are not immediately hostile, unless they are attacked first.*
3. **Mineral Elemental** *Use the* ***earth elemental,*** *but replace all instances of ""bludgeoning"" with ""piercing,"" remove the damage resistances, and add a vulnerability to bludgeoning. Add the following trait:* ***Crystal skin:*** *When a creature hits the elemental with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, they take 1d6 slashing damage.*
4. A 10-15 foot tall crystal spire, pulsing softly with white, black, red, green, or blue light. It is a creature, with AC 5 and 50 HP, and will react to players as an elemental might.
5. The abandoned camp of a previous adventuring party or expedition party, which was either slain by Alleh-Fallig or petrified by the Great Problem.
6. **1d4 Alleh-Fallig** *Use the stat block for a* ***bullette,*** *with the following changes: replace all instances of ""bludgeoning"" with ""piercing,"" it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage and immune to poison damage, it is immune to the exhausted, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious conditions, it has a fly speed of 20 ft., it has the* ***mineral elemental****'s ""crystal skin"" trait, it has the ""magic resistance trait,"" it has an Intelligence score of 16 (+3), and speaks primordial. They are immediately hostile and want to drive the players out of the plane, but are open to negotiation if a great effort towards peace is made.\**

&amp;#x200B;

For me, and perhaps those with a more scholarly incline, this place is a thoroughly unique ecosystem of its own kind, and a trove of life and the potential for new information that could reform the way we think about what is it to be a living thing. However, I cannot expect you to come to see it in the same way; to you, it will always be a dungeon. Nothing but a deep series of rooms, stretching and branching vertically with no regard to human movement, and covered in deadly knives: the ultimate challenge, with the ultimate reward of as many jewels and gems as one could ever need or hope for.",1,The Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,32,664,"*So the party just wanted to investigate the deserted old graveyard but now the Gnome Monk jumped in front of her friends to protect them and before someone could react a massive furred beast sank its yellow fangs into her torso?  
Or maybe the Halfling Rogue thought it might be cool to be a werewolf and cut his arm with a tooth like an idiot although there is no Cleric or Paladin in sight?*

In cases like these it comes in handy to have some rules for characters that contracted lycanthropy and since I don't really like what few things are recommended in the Monster Manual, I decided to write down my own version. I would love your feedback on this, as this is my first bigger homebrew ruleset.
This is pure mechanics and doesn't really contain any lore or something, that is what every DM can do for him/herself. These rules are meant to make being a werewolf possible while you also have your character class. But of course, the abilities come at a cost.

Also, /u/ThePatchworkWizard was a bit faster than me and has already uploaded a rule set some days ago. But I still wanted to post mine since it is different.

---


#The Rules

Lycanthropy can be handled as a curse or as a disease. However it can only be removed by either *Remove curse* or *Greater Restoration* or anything comparable but more powerful (like a *Wish*).

###Saving throws
Whenever you polymorph from your True into the Hybrid or Wolf form or from the Hybrid into the Wolf form or whenever you kill someone with your bite attack, you can choose to make a DC10 Charisma saving throw. If you fail, you lose control for an hour.  
During the third quarter of the moon phases you can choose to make a DC15 Charisma save every evening or you lose control for the duration of the night.  
In the night of the full moon you can choose to make a DC21 Charisma save or you lose control for the duration of the night. Choosing to not do the saves represents giving in to your inner monster.  
The DM may allow another saving throw before you take a drastic action, such as killing a dear friend.

###Losing control
A character that has lost control transforms into a bloodthirsty beast and doesn't care much for friendships or bonds. During this time your character will be taken over by the DM and act accordingly to your new main goals: eating fresh meat, hunting and staying alive. You are also more agressive than normally and will always be in wolf or hybrid form. You will attack anyone trying to harm or entrap you. This state lasts until the specified time or until the polymorph is reverted or the curse is removed or an additional saving throw is successful.  
When you regain your control, you take a level of exhaustion.  

###Polymorphing
Polymorphing into another form takes an action.

###Darkvision
You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

##Hybrid form
*You keep your equipment, although some clothes may rip. The class abilities are also retained. Your Armour class increases by 1.  
Resistances: bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage from non magical, non silvered weapons.  
Vulnerabilities: silvered weapons.  
Keen hearing and smell: You have advantage on perception checks that rely on listening and/or smelling.  
You gain two new forms of melee attacks:  
Claw attack: +(proficiency+STR) to hit, 1d4+STR slashing damage.  
Bite attack: +(proficiency+STR) to hit, 1d6+STR piercing damage and a humanoid target (DMs discretion) has to make a DC(8+your proficiency+your CON modifier) CON save or contract lycanthropy.*

##Wolf form  
*The same advantages as in the Hybrid form apply, however the previously worn equipment and carried weapons or objects stay where they were.  
Your movement increases by 10ft.  
You can't speak and can't make claw attacks. You can't read, write, use magic items or understand what others are saying.*

###Higher levels
At 5th level, the damage of your claw attack increases to 1d6+STR and the damage of your bite attack increases to 1d8+STR. While in wolf or hybrid form, your Strength is increased by 1.  
At 10th level, the damage of your claw attack increases to 1d8+STR and the damage of your bite attack increases to 1d10+STR. While in wolf or hybrid form, your Strength is increased by 2.

***Optional: Slow alignment change***  
*Every time you lose control over your ability, it is marked down on a status bar. After a certain amount of fails there is a change in your alignment, representing the corruption of your mind by the curse.  
The DM can then either take control over the character (if that was discussed with the player earlier) or the player can roleplay that change. This decision depends on the dynamic of your group and your experience as role players.*

---

*Edit:*  
Some of you have given me great feedback. I think I will change some things for my own game. Not making class abilities usable in hybrid and wolf form makes the whole thing a lot less powerful but still desirable because of resistances and maybe more damage. Also I think during combat or during actual play the player should get more saving throws and also play the character **but** have many relevant actions (attack this person) dictated by the DM. It is still a curse after all.  
Losing control during a night could be handled as amnesia and/or blood on their clothes etc in the morning.
This way it should remain unclear whether or not lycanthropy is a good thing for a PC and it also lets them actually play without making them too powerful.
",1,The Beast Within - Alternative Rules For Lycanthropy
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,16,303,"A list of newspapers that adventurers can read to pass time, find jobs in, hear the latest news...or use for torches. 

1. The Trapfinder's Digest: If Thieve's Cant had a newspaper, this would be it. It's full of advice on apparently innocent tasks, like removing and replacing screws without leaving a mark, or how to disassemble a door hinge. Sometimes carries coupons for Thieves' Tools or Tinker's Tools. Not widely published, back-room sort of stuff.
2. The Thunder Bolt And Battle Cry Of Freedom!: A rabble-rousing, over-exuberant newspaper. They mean well, to be sure, it's just that they scream 'Tyrant!' when somebody asks them to take off their swords before entering the palace or not ride horses through the village green during a fair. Rather proliferant.
3. Call to Serve: A martial-minded magazine edited by a grouchy Half-orc ex-Fighter. Their solution to everything seems to involve armored cavalry or alchemical bombardment. A good place to pick up new quests; the classifieds always have openings for mercenaries, although it's not usually glorious stuff. Pretty uncommon.
4. The Gentleman's Clubs' of the Realm's Heralding Paper: Don't be fooled for a minute by the genteel-sounding title. The Gentleman's is a code-carrying paper used to smuggle communication, instructions or threats between gang leaders. Each gang leader in the magazine has a pseudonym or code phrase, like ""The Leisure Club of Blue Mountain"" or ""Mr. Carl"". Easy to find around the 'wrong crowd'.
5. The Sorcerers' Harken: An above-the-board magazine on magic and it's practitioners. Carries advice from all manner of casters- wizards, witches, necromancers, diviners -as well as recent magical discoveries and debates. You can get coupons for spell components or scrolls (at participating stores) from the back.
6. The Modern Belle: A fashion magazine, although a terribly snooty one; the writers are quick to dismiss something as old-fashioned and inelegant when just last week they raved about how it would revolutionize the craft. As popular and widely-spread as the average tabloid.
7. The Gourmand's Guide: A dedicated compilation of all the dishes that are the rage these days. Carries recipes, catalogs and coupons for cooking equipment, and interviews with professional chefs. It isn't that popular, and you'd have to know what you were looking for to find it.
8. The Bulwark: A badly written ragging-rag. What does it rag on? Just about anything, it seems. Leaders who are too dedicated to old institutions, leaders who are too distant from the old institutions, a bad economy, an economy that they think is too good. It isn't hard to find.
9. The Gentleman of Fortune: Yarr, matey, 'tis a pestilent rag when comes to news- mere gossip, it be -but when it comes to the reportin' o boardings 'n' plunderin's a-plenty, blast me, ye can rely on the ole Gentleman. Any saloon-keep worth the salt in the bay will be sellin' copies of it.
10. Godspeed And Keep Well: An average paper, although they're more dedicated than most to keeping people up with international affairs. More than one tyrant or coup has been exposed for the lightning-fast, clockwork writing and delivery of the Godspeed.
11. Boys' Own Paper: A children's newspaper, containing fascinating tales of perilous adventure (often with slightly exaggerated comics to accompany) and catalogs of toys like Magic Bubble Pipes, The Shimmering Sword of Heroism (Watch it Flicker And Glow!) or the Fearsome Helm of Conquest. By subscription only.
12. The Long Rest: An adventurer's paper, in a way. Carries the latest tips, 'hot' dungeons (ones that have been found and not yet explored completely) and accounts of dungeon-runs. Each edition carries an updated map of the region, with an out-of-five skull and star rating for each dungeon- skull for risk, star for reward. Subscription is 1 gp per month.
13. The Make-free: A satirical paper whose icon is a crown on a roasting spit. Full of sharp wits cracking jokes at the expense of the latest scandal or, should there be none, current events in general. Widespread, and pretty funny.
14. The Strange and Ancient: A pulp-fiction magazine that carries the latest edge-of-the-seat thriller stories. Often comes with a mock-up City Watch report as an epilogue to one of the tales. And one trading card per edition! By subscription only.
15. Wilds'-word: You wouldn't expect druids, rangers, hermits and other wilderness-dwellers to have a newspaper, but they do. Advice columns, expeditions being organized, and the usual cranky woodland-dweller writing a blistering fusillade against cottages. By subscription only, but no matter where you live, it'll get to you.
16. The Usual Suspects: A crime magazine that reports on nefarious deeds across the region. They might follow one criminal for a few weeks or even months. They carry a large section of Wanted Dead Or Alive ads in the back.
17. Word on the Streets: A magazine, believe it or not. A flashy tabloid that always seems to be losing it's mind over yet another tremendous scandal in the nearest court. It's actually been banned in some places for slander.
18. The Ten Foot Pole: It's a catalog of adventuring equipment. You can send away for 50 feet and 2 inches of hemp rope, spears, whetstones, bulk torches, and even low-grade magical items! Although if you do ask for a ten-foot pole, they'll send you instructions as follows: Locate tree branch of desirable length. Remove from tree.
19. The Fearful Clamor: Another ragging-rag, the Clamor is a very niche paper: specifically criticism for music. It's not even a report on the performance. It's just two spiteful old codgers laying into the latest star with all the venom they can muster, which is a considerable amount.
20. Shevannai: An elvish paper. The words may appear unintelligible, because they are. They're not printed plain, but rather a certain dialect of Sylvan that's a little like sheet music for the voice. The topics are usually about intrigue in the various Fey courts. Available by subscription only, and the Fey editor will demand payment in the strangest things: tears of happiness, wooden chess pieces, or abandoned dreams.
21. The General Cryer: Exactly what it sounds like. A general paper with small sections devoted to various topics. Available more or less everywhere.
22. Play the Fool: A humor weekly paper. Carries everything from short sketches to one-liners to puns to comics (""Ye Funnie Pages""). Available by subscription, although you might pick up last week's in a bar or barbershop.
23. The Sentinel - Hark the Cry!: A dwarvish general newspaper, gossip, recipes, current events. They got in trouble last year over slightly discriminatory comments about...well, everything that isn't dwarves, actually. And their subscription forms are done in Dwarvish as well.
24. The Crown of Bones: Who said hobgoblins don't have newspapers? Wherever there's a Hobgoblin supply-line or garrison, you can be sure that the Crown of Bones is following. It's the usual stuff for Hobgoblins- conquests, raids- all done up in martial slang, and they make the slightest victory sound like a complete military triumph. The Hobgoblins sometimes use it as propaganda.
25. The Whisperer in the Dark: A Drow newspaper. Often carries coded messages, but for the most part it's just a tabloid. The titles are always eye-grabbing bait. Only available in the Underdark, and written in Undercommon.
26. Screams of the Damned: Believe it or not, the newspaper of choice of the dark cities of demons in the Nine Hells. An edition of the Screams, brought to the surface, will in fact shriek horribly as it bursts into flames and shrivels to ash. Available in the Material Plane, if you're a servant of the darker powers and really want a paper that does nothing but set itself on fire. Written in Abyssal.
27. Tremors in the Web: Another Drow newspaper. Rags excessively on surface-dwellers, and often carries overly descriptive pieces describing raids or the demise of lost delvers. Their icon is a decapitated duergar head at the center of a spiderweb.
28. As the Crow Flies: A rural sort of newspaper that doesn't usually carry much interesting. New Corn Field Planted. Corn Harvest A Success. Farmer Jack Found Dead, Crucified In Field. Jack Farm Burnt Down In Horrid Accident. All sorts of devastatingly dull stuff.
29. Nightingale: A paper full of ballads. You subscribe, and each week you'll get new songs or tunes for various instruments. Pretty good stuff, too. The people who write the songs are very dedicated to making things simple yet elegant.
30. Hail! The Call to Legend!: Another adventurer's paper. Carries the usual- dungeon ratings, gear catalogs, inn and tavern ratings and reviews, a particular stick-figure comic, as well as interviews and advice from veteran adventurers.
31. The Gaze of the Void: A philosophers' bi-weekly that always seems to carry the same messages of doubting existence, existential dread, and the overall futility of life. Hey, it's free, though!
32. With Iron Fist And Blooded Sword: Every petty dungeon overlord wants to be the ruler of the world. This paper serves as a sort of forum for them. Boasting about their latest crushing of an adventuring party, advice on how to deal with thieves disarming traps, how to curse loot, or what to use as a phylactery.
33. /;""\\|\~\`\`-  : A Sahuagin magazine...well, it's more like clay or stone tablets that they scratch raid plans or outcomes into and deliver between their villages. Attempts to translate the title make it something like ""We Killed These People And Took Their Things Here's What They Had"".
34. Acquired Taste: An *insufferably* Posh magazine about wine and cheese. Only wine and cheese, and all too expensive for you. You can practically hear the columnists' noses in the air while they write when you read it. *Very* exclusive.
35. The Garb: A slightly less insufferably posh magazine about men's fashion. You can get coupons, catalogs, and, of course, pictures of people wearing or columns of people talking about the latest finery. Utterly smashing hats abound, don't they just, old chap.
36. The Mutual Pact: *Beholders* have a paper? You wouldn't think so, would you, but they do. Actually, it's more like Beholder's minions have a paper. It invariably contains two things: long columns of Beholders threatening each other, and longer ones of Beholders responding to last week's threats against them.
37. The Crime Scene Newsflash: A rather morbid but terrifyingly enthusiastic paper that follows and ranks the most grisly crimes of each month. Why would anybody want this? Some people speculate it's got coded messages in it. Turns out, it's just that shock value sells.
38. ia! ia! Shtunggli'ah! : A *mind flayer* newspaper. Hey, the Elder Brain can't keep them informed on everything, it's got better things to think about. The paper is written in Deep Speech. Attempts to read it require both knowledge of the language and a DC 14 WIS save against 2d4 psychic damage. The title means, roughly, To Inform.
39. Voces Coeli - The Voices of Heaven: a celestial newspaper, only available in the Astral Sea. Well, not quite a news*paper*; just voices from on high, telling you about the latest upon the mountains and thrones and in the courts of the gods. Popular among Empyreans.
40. The Hammer's Fall: Extra, extra, read all about it! These thin metal sheets carry on them only the freshest, highest-quality news from the cities of the Azers. Trying to read them in the Material Plane instead of the Elemental Plane of Fire may burn your fingertips, as the sheets are always red-hot.
41. The Chorus of the Crows: A fey news-sheet, published by a minor Fey princess called the Queen of Mourning. Each dawn, she writes the list of those who did not see the sun rise that day, with tears for ink and a crow-feather quill. Anyone who isn't dead or mechanical and tries to read it must make a DC 14 CHA save or grieve for 1d4 hours over those who have passed on.
42. Salvation's Roar: A slightly bombastic newspaper published by an order of Good paladins of Tempus. Tends to relate to the Total Smashing of Tyrants, the Protection of the Weak and the Uprooting of Evil Ways And Slavery from the Land. Not the best proofreading, but they really do mean well.
43. The Teller of All: A newspaper published by an underground cult of Vecna. The average page looks a \[Redacted\] bit like \[TOP SECRET!\], which \[SECRET\] the average edition \[NO\] little hard to read. After all, secrets must be kept. But if you've been sold the solution that, painted on to the pages, removes the black censor ink, you can see quite interesting things indeed...
44. The Firing Squad: A ragging-rag, but mostly 'ragging'; 'Executioner', the editor, restricts the criticism of who or whatever is the latest to face the Firing Squad (the readers) to a civil, thoughtful level. No unnecessary meanness, critiques must be coherent and understandable. Executioner himself is in fact a young dwarvish girl who started the Firing Squad in her schoolgirl days to roast the headmistress of her school. The paper's symbol is a fool's cap pierced by three arrows.
45. In the Dead of Night: Another extraplanar newspaper, this one published by a small enclave of shadar-kai. Because it's a Shadowfell paper, ItDoN's reporting is always gloomy and negatively phrased. ""The sky will blister us with the furious wrath of the dying star this Tuesday, followed by the tears of the gods of mercy weeping upon the cruel world later in the afternoon...""
46. The Proper Catalog: Yet another genteel name hiding a dirty enterprise, the Proper is a slave catalog. Coded columns quote quality and pricing for the 'wares'.
47. Cloaked Broom: A humor paper that carries the tales of the latest pranks and hijinks across the realm. Hilarious stuff, every week.
48. The Contraption Attraction: A **kobold** paper. Edited by a slightly evil human named Tucker. Used to exchange trap ideas between warrens, as well as keep track of the doings and attitudes of various dragons.
49. Dear Morgan: Morgan is a sensible old Elvish lady who answers all sorts of questions. It started out as an advice column in the *Godspeed And Keep Well*, but it got too large to handle, so she got her own magazine. She gives stellar advice, though.
50. Just Like Clockwork: The official newspaper of the Artificer's Guild! Delivered to your door (or drawbridge, or portcullis, or whatever) by mechanical hummingbirds or gerbils or whatnot. Blueprints, debates, discoveries, the lot. By subscription.
51. The Bleeding Horn: Another monstrous newspaper, this one of the goblins. Copies of the Bleeding Horn are little more than stolen sheets of paper with columns from other newspapers cut and pasted onto them, occasionally with a doodle of the latest treasure trove the band made off with. Their icon is a ram's-horn horn dripping blood.
52. Another Go: A satire of journalism itself, Another Go pokes fun at the speculations or dismissals that other newspapers make. Whether it's what was *supposed* to be **the** look for last year that never took off, or the idle disregard of what turned out to be the beginning of a coup, they'll give it Another Go. Their slogan is Reporting In Retrospect.
53. The Weekly Eruption: Published for the djinn in the City of Brass, the Eruption is another gossip tabloid with the horrible tendency to: a) overblow the slightest rumor into a wild scheme, and b) be about 50 degrees Celsius. It's printed on thin sheets of tin.
54. The Deep Caller: A Deurgar paper that can be found in most of their major cities. It's pretty dull stuff, to be honest. 'Exciting' in the Underdark is bad. But it wouldn't kill them to embellish the stories they do run a little bit. You could get put to sleep by the way they write.
55. The Facial Sculpting and Grooming Gazette: Not quite a paper. You send in your subscription, 2.5 gp per month, and you get each month a little box from them in your mailbox. Aside from a little pamphlet detailing styles and tips you can get everything from razors to makeup to hair-oil to hairspray to hair-dye...wildly popular among classier Dwarves, and with a good following all around.
56. The Mechanus Periodical Information Supplement: Costs a fortune to ship between the realms- 25 gp per issue -but if you're that sort of person it's worth it. The paper it's printed on is enchanted- you can't skim it. You're either reading it at a reasonable pace to absorb all necessary information, or you are not reading it. As a source of current-events news with absolutely no bias at all, it's outstanding. As a good read...try something else.
57. The Sea-stalker's Companion: A periodical for fishermen. Cheap, unadorned, and to the point.
58. The Gamesman's Guide: A bi-weekly issue for hunting, trapping and fishing. Contains catalogs for gear, pro tips and recent records. Pretty good stuff.
59. The Rider's Gazette: A weekly magazine for all sorts of mounted sports. Horses? Yup. Donkeys? Yup. Mules? Yup. Wolves? Yup. Wyverns? Yup. They've got it all, and catalogs for gear and Getting Started kits.
60. The General's Runner: A periodical for toy-soldier collectors. They've got catalogs, updates on various Army Game rules, tips on how to paint your toy soldiers, strategies and tactics. By subscription.
61. The True-Seer: An obsessive conspiracy-theory paper. The writers seem to see Doppelgangers and illusory masks everywhere. Every title screams about the world ending or every sentient race being on the brink of enslavement by giant flail snails.
62. Hark! - True Tales: Not quite a gossip tabloid. Just a monthly collection of ""truth is stranger than fiction"" incidents or factoids. Worth the buy from your local newsstand.
63. The Candy House: A witch's paper. Carries the formulas for new hexes, cooking recipes for small children (as in, how to cook small children) and studies on things like bread-crumb trails and tin woodsmen. Published by a Night Hag named Mavis.
64. The Outdoorsman's Catalog: A monthly catalog of sporting gear. High-quality stuff only, as it's a pretty classy magazine. Everything from fish-lures to bird-snares.
65. The Delver's Delight: A dungeoneering catalog that comes in a box to the local post office, along with a monthly ""care package"" of caltrops, torches, hemp rope and iron rations.",1,Hot Off the Presses
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,111,"**Writing a World Origin**

So, your campaign most likely exists as a multiplanar system. How did those planes originate? What does this entail for your final plots, big bads, and cataclysmic world-ending events? How about the origin of the Gods and magic? 

For the worldbuilding DM, this is all essential. It can inform a lot of major plot points and aspects of the world. Here is a walk-through of my creative process for breaking down and building up your own planar origins.

Here's some questions you should ask yourself:

1. High magic or low magic? How was magic made?
2. How significant of a role do the Gods have? Why do they do what they do?
3. How were the mortal races created?
4. What major planar events has the world already experienced?

1 2 and 3 are rather simple. I want a high-magic campaign in a world of many Gods who enjoy pulling strings. I also want magic and mortal races to be created by the Gods, or some primordial force. But why did they do it? We'll get to that later. 

Now onto 4. My rule is to pick 3-4 names for major planar time periods. I like to give them names and work from there. I'll also incorporate the typical tropes of a creation myth, which I study academically. 

* **THE FOUNDING** (Trope: there was nothing, then powerful forces gave life to the primordial waters of the void! Get as creative as you want with this one)
* **THE DYING** (Trope: a betrayal, a suffering, a search for purpose --think Zeus killing Kronos or God throwing Adam and Eve out of Eden-- or Tharizdun the Chained God! Often the Lower Planes are created here)
* **THE BINDING** (Trope: the betrayer/force is forever chained, creating an era of peace-- often there is still fallout from this act)
* **THE RISING** (Trope: a prosperous era! Some major information or power is revealed to the mortals. Sometimes campaigns take place Post-Fall, and that's fun too; often the mortal fall mirrors the divine fall during creation, or is caused by it)

Alright, this is getting fun. **The Founding** seems clear; since this is God/magic-driven, we need some ultra-powerful force to create the universe. 

""*As matter first rose from the void, two primordial forces came into being. They solidified from the material of the shapeless ether, known only as Life and Death, give and take, the beginning and the end. From the void, Life fashioned the first plane, a raw mass of life and energy.""*

Sounds dramatic. But raw energy isn't all it's cracked up to be, let's create some order.

""*Though the two forces were strong, they would be incomplete without one another. Together, they brought Nature and Time into the world, Nature in Life’s image and Time in Death’s.""*

Now, the origin of magic.

""*Life then gave birth to seven complex and concrete beings. Nature gave them shape, and Time gave them a lifespan. The beings called themselves the Prime, Godlike in all senses, but still mortal. Each Prime embodied a facet of raw arcane power; Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Transmutation and Illusion. The Prime, lacking purpose, revelled in chaos and war, creating many planes of existence. These would later become the Inner Planes, worlds of energy and elemental chaos.""*

Alright. Divine beings, great. But in D&amp;D, these are forces to be manipulated, not Gods... so next we have **The Dying.**

*""Life grieved at the chaos of war, but knew Death would take the Prime soon. In a dying act, they ceased their warring and each pleaded for Life to create a new set of divine beings in their image. Life could not resist, and from the final breaths of the Prime, those that call themselves Gods were formed. As for the Prime, their dormant essences were forged and stretched across the planes in many threads, weaved to stabilize the chaotic planes.""*

Next, time to chain up the primordial forces of Life and Death. As creator forces in mythology, they often go dormant or are controlled in some way. Also, the Prime had a lifespan, whereas the Gods do not.... how did that happen? Time for **The Binding.** 

*""The Gods, Life’s new creations, were made to take on the responsibility of creation so they would not fight like the Prime. And so, Life split herself in many fragments. With that, she gave her will over to each God. Now, like Life and Death, the Gods were bound to the Outer Planes. The Gods then made the Material Plane, and in Life’s honour, created the mortal races to inhabit it. Soon, the mortals began worshipping the Gods, devoting their souls to the higher powers.*

*Holding within them the knowledge of Life, the Gods were aware of their lifespan. As they ascended to the peak of their power, they held counsel to confront their impending mortality. Many spoke to accept their place in the cosmos, but others were resolved to chain Death down and make themselves immortal.* 

*The dominant Gods enticed mortals to worship by revealing to them how to manipulate threads of Prime power. Their souls became the links that forcefully bound the primordial Death. Now, Death could never come for the new Gods, but the Gods must usher mortal souls to him. In his absence, the final school of magic, Necromancy, was born.""*

Okay, that one got out of hand. Many many key factors. Magic exists naturally, but the knowledge was gifted to people by the Gods... meaning the original casters were all divine. Finally, **The Rising**. A prosperous time of existence. What did magic do for the people?

*""Manipulating Prime power gave mortals the ability to use magic. This knowledge, and in some cases innate ability, allowed them to rise to dominate the Material Plane. These creator races were once well-suited to the wild Nature that dominated their plane. But through Time, they developed more advanced ways of being, and became the races known across the Material Plane today.""*

And there we have it! The current time period of existence. I hope this explained my thought process decently well. I decided to do a walkthrough rather than just lore-dump. Maybe someone finds my thought process interesting or would like to critique my worldbuilding. Go for it!

&amp;#x200B;

Every edition of D&amp;D handles dying differently, and 5e's rules, while simple and generally adequate, aren't very scary. You guaranteed have at least one round where you won't die instantly (bar outside influences such as taking damage at 0 HP), and healing is plentiful. In addition, the difference in being at 1 HP and being at 100 isn't that large, offensively speaking- while it's \*safer\* to have more HP, a Barbarian's Greataxe swings just as hard and a fireball doesn't burn any less for having a dim spark of life in the caster. My houserule aims to change that, ideally without being too horribly punishing at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

When a player is knocked to 0 HP, they are dying and begin making death saving throws, as normal. Let's say Sally the Sorcerer ate an axe to the ribs and is bleeding out on the ground right now. Over the next two rounds, Sally's player rolls a 14 and a 2 on two death saving throws. That's one success and one fail. So far, nothing is changed. Marcus, the blind cleric who travels with the party, has finally realized that Sally is laying on the ground without all of her insides inside and heals her- the amount doesn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, whenever you get up from dying because you're now at 1 HP or higher, you stop tracking both failed and succeeded death saving throws. Under this houserule, you don't- you start back over at 0 for successful death saving throws, but continue to keep track of failed ones. In addition, while Sally's intestines are now where they belong, she lost a lot of blood over the course of those twelve seconds and no one bothered to remove the axe from her side; Sally now has a [level of exhaustion](https://gyazo.com/8969e9986e5aed3e399efb2224d059d1). This level of exhaustion represents blood loss and weariness from being on the verge of death, as well as other injuries that don't have a mechanical effect (a golem hits Marcus in the head hard enough to knock them out- when he's healed up, he has a level of exhaustion from the concussion that comes when stone meets head at high velocity). Any time that a character gets up from 0 HP, they get a level of exhaustion. This exhaustion can be removed in the normal way (long rest, specific magic, resurrection).

&amp;#x200B;

So Sally has an axe in her ribs, 3 HP, a death save already failed, and disadvantage on all ability checks, hindering her ability to back flip away from the barbarian who happens to have a backup axe. This axe is kindly given to Sally, who ends up holding the axe between a couple vertebrae, paying 3 HP for the barbarian's trouble. Sally's dying again, but she doesn't start with a clean 0-0 slate of death saves; she's 0 for 1. She manages to stabilize after rolling a 3, a 13, a 19, and a 14, but when she wakes up 1d4 hours later at the barbarian's camp caged up, she finds herself limping around her cage at halved speed (due to two levels of exhaustion) and on the verge of death.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr don't stop tracking failed death saves after returning to above 0 HP and any time you get up from dying, add a level of exhaustion",1,(House Rule) My Method of Making Hitting 0 HP Scarier
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,17,161,"Long time lurker here! It's been a while since resurrection has been discussed here, so I figured what better way to come out of the shadows than to dust off an old topic and add my two cents. 

I find that death, and the consequences thereof, are often a crucial part of any adventure, and the way that death can be handled in higher level D&amp;D parties games sucks all the stakes out of dying. Sure, dying at low levels has meaning and gravity, as that character is typically lost forever or the players must rush for aid to save their party member. However, as a game progresses, death becomes an inconvenience more than anything else, and a trivial one at that if your party has amassed a hefty wealth. In my opinion, dying should be an ordeal, let alone coming back from the dead. It should have some long-term impact, and not *necessarily* a negative consequence. I'm not always looking to slap my players on the wrist for dying, as with any obstacle I put in front of them (or they put in front of themselves), they should have a possibility of becoming more powerful after overcoming it. But I also think there should be some wear-and-tear on person if they're constantly being to returned to life. Plus, the tension of not knowing if a resurrection will have a good or bad result helps add tension and stakes to the process.

So, if you have a similar philosophy on death and resurrection, I've created a [d100 Table of Resurrection Consequences](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mm1JGkPzps6BVlMxEaUsWrH72NQJNuAyvlfQCRKRwSQ/edit?usp=sharing) and added a few rules for returning to life, depending on the flavor of fantasy your game is (As a note, this table uses a typically generic fantasy 'Heaven and Hell' afterlife, but there's plenty of room to tweak it for your own setting). With these rules, depending on how many times the character has died prior to their current death, they have a greater chance of poor outcomes, and a greater chance that their very being will degrade. There are also some quirks of resurrection, which I've split into physical and personality quirks, as just in case you don't want foist personality changes on your players' characters.

Thoughts are welcome and hope you enjoy!",1,Resurrection Consequences Tables
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,7,115,"**Carrion Crawler Expansion**

This post is an addition to the Carrion Crawler that I’m implementing in my campaign that can add a lot more depth and horror to an old favorite monster in the DnD canon. I give my carrion crawler’s this extra action. 

Infest: A Carrion Crawler can lay eggs in the mouth of a paralyzed creature within 5 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infested with Carrion Crawler grubs. 

A creature infected in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, the creature’s infection worsens and the creature suffers one level of exhaustion. Any effect that cures a disease will cure this infection without removing any existing levels of exhaustion. 

A creature killed by this infestation becomes a hive. Inside the creature lives 2 (1d4) swarms of crawler grubs plus 1 for each size category it is above small. Two, for medium. Three, for large, et cetera. Each swarm uses the statistics for a Swarm of Rot Grubs, found in Volo’s.


**Plot Threads:**

The party encounters a destroyed goblin village, strewn with the corpses of its inhabitants. Roll d6 on encountering a dead goblin. On a roll of 1-3 the goblin is a hive full of as many grub swarms as the number you rolled on the die. A single goblin, nearly mad with exhaustion and illness squats in the remains of an old shanty house. “Don’t eat the bad meat” she whispers to herself. 


At a local fete to celebrate the solstice as it comes, ale pours freely out of great big wooden casks. Any party member with a passive perception above 12 notices something wriggling in the bottom of their glass.

The corpse of a hill giant decays at the bottom of a cave, next to the water that feeds into the town’s well. If no one gets rid of the body, everyone in town will get sick. But what could have killed such a big creature? 5 (2d4) fully grown carrion crawlers live in its body and have made this cave their home. 

No one could have expected this from the hobgoblin siege. When they rolled their giant machines up to the gates outside the city, local magical practitioners began to cast Wall of Stone and Stone Shape to shore up the defenses. It was no match for the trebuchet firing these insectoid horrors directly into the city center.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,71,211,"Hey guys, it's Panther here! Taking a break from editing the GM binder document to bring you a thread about ""The Weird Stuff"".

All month, ~~I've been crowdsourcing a list of treasure from you all, so I never have to make up loot again~~ we've collectively been making a supplement to Dungeon Master's Guide list of treasure.

Finally, it's time for the ""Weird Stuff"". This is basically any magical treasure that didn't fit neatly into the other categories.

Here are my rules...

- Please build your item with 5e mechanics in mind. They don't have to be balanced, but they have to work within the bounds of 5e.

- This is meant to supplement stuff from the DMG. Please don't just reskin stuff that is already available.

- Please, please, please follow my format. I'm working on editing all of the items into a GM binder document for everyone. If you follow the format, you significantly cut down on the amount of work  I have to do. If the format is not followed, I will remove your item and let you know.

- [Formatting help can be found here if you need it.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting)

- As an FYI, when I am editing the items for the GM binder, I may notice that there is an inconsistency, or maybe a small wording issue. If I need to change the wording of your item, I will do so.


###The format is below


#### Item Name should be big like this
*Rarity should be italicized* (Attunement Requirements are not italicized)

""This is the item description. Please be as detailed as you need to be, but also try to be concise if you can. If your item requires a table, please post that too. Text is normal sized""

***Lore*** Add your flavor text for the item here. Try to keep things setting agnostic, so anyone can use it. Any suggestions about player level may go here. Please make this a blurb, not a novella. If I feel it's too long, I'll trim it with your OK.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,53,752," Hello everyone,

Since the last time I posted on /r/DnDBehindTheScreen I have been hard at work improving my monster hunter monster manual and my guide to monster hunting. First and foremost, I have updated the monster manual with a clickable table of contents, in addition to some grammar and other typos.  Secondly, I have updated the manual with the Leshen and Ancient Leshen from the MHW crossover event.

&amp;#x200B;

The Leshen &amp; Ancient Leshen are both originally from the Witcher series, but with the crossover event, we got to see what they might be like in a monster hunter setting. Now these have already been created in the Book of Beautiful Horrors by another redditor on unearthed arcana, but mine have been created to specifically represent their skills and abilities from the crossover event.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sqoCNe9z7q9u_B7BGdotFzFs0mtt44iw) you can find a seperate pdf with just the leshen &amp; ancient leshen.

Or you can find a completely updated version of the now 157 page monster hunter monster manual with a clickable table of contents below.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,46,1219,"*When my group first started playing about 2 years ago, I wanted a reason for the PC's to all be together regardless of race/class/backstory. I was reading Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller series and thought that an Academy would be a good way to do that. I've copied my notes over to this post so you guys can use the setting if you'd like. This setting also gives you a good narrative backup if a player wants to try out a new character for a few sessions (a new student is joining the party while Tim goes home for a few weeks). I started our current campaign by telling the players that they were grouped together to perform their 1st year capstone project together.*

Here you go - feel free to use/adapt as you like.

**The White Haven Academy**

**History:**

* Started as a military training grounds to train fighters for the White Haven Army, as time went on, leadership realized the potential of magic in battle and decided they would train magic users also.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,15,140,"Haven't seen this here in the couple of months since i joined Reddit, so here goes. A common fixture in some settings might be the store, tavern, or other business that wasn't in that location previously but has some sort of perception filter upon it so that nobody considers it strange that it just appeared between one day and the next.

One such is Lian McDowell's **Eclectic Emporium**.

""Welcome Travelers! Please browse my wares, but you must ask to handle any merchandise behind the glass. Also keep in mind the three signs posted on the wall. They are indeed accurate. Shoplifters and thieves practicing their trade will be violated. Attacking anyone, especially myself, on the premises will be punished quite severely. There are NO refunds, exchanges, or anything of the sort - all sales are final. So browse, select, buy or trade. All manner of coin may be accepted for the value of such.""

The actual merchandise found within can vary wildly from one manifestation of the shop to another. Anything from elemental planar pets to non-magical clothing to adventuring supplies to copies of legendary otherworldly items can be found on the shelves and racks. Consider it like a trip to your local Goodwill but Lian's merchandise is from all over the multiverse and can be things from popular movies or books manifested in reality.

Finding the place just once is possible. Finding it more than once is almost impossible but in an infinite multiverse or with the aid of suitable magic it isn't completely impossible.

Some sample items (anyone wishing to add more items in comments are welcome):

**NERDS** \- a box of 2d8 small sweet-tart candies. Eating one gives a +1 to Intelligence and a -1 to Strength for one hour. More than one at a time gives no additional benefits. 1sp, limit one box per customer.

**THIS ONE RING** \- This Ring of Invisibility is a copy of another ring that was destroyed long ago. It has the unfortunate side of effect of making the wearer more paranoid if worn for more than five minutes at a time. The wearer also becomes MORE visible to any undead in the area while the invisibility effect is active. 50gp, limit one

**WAND OF DISINTEGRATION** \- Upon the command word being given, the wand turns itself into ash and crumples away. 5sp, limit 3.

**GUITAR OF BASHING** \- +2 weapon. Musical instrument. Makes a ka-bong sound when smashing into something. 150gp, limit 1.

**GRAB BAG** \- When bag is thrown or opened, 1d4 tentacles erupt from the opening and attempt to grapple anything nearby. Anything grappled (successful Save Vs Dexterity to avoid) is drawn within the bag the next turn (Save Vs Strength to break free first) and vanishes. After 1d4 turns, the item is vomited back out of the bag. Anyone who was drawn within is considered stunned and shaken by the experience. Experience for those drawn within: 1 - too many angles, 2 - pretty colors and rainbows and unicorns, 3 - at the bottom of a well of slugs and centipedes and other crawlies, 4 - a lightless void of infinite cold, 5 - the best steakhouse in the multiverse, 6 - your character just met Matt Mercer at a convention where he complimented you on your cosplay. 1gp, limit 3 per visit.

**POTION OF REINCARNATION** \- random race and gender are possible. 50gp, limit 3.

**BEER** \- there's actually a pretty good selection of this as Lian is rather fond of the occasional brew and most are perfectly safe to drink because even a shopkeeper who keeps a number of cursed items in stock has limits on what they're willing to do. prices vary between 10cp and 15gp per bottle depending on quality. limit 10 bottles per visit.

**INSTANT MONSTER** (just add water) a gemstone. 1gp. completely random monster. may or may not be hostile. Unique monsters such as Godzilla only last for 1d6 turns before they vanish. limit 5 per visit.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,16,"#**Tharmekhûl**

**The Forge-Tender, The Apprentice, Siegemaster**

**Demi-Power of Mount Celestia
NG**

Portfolio: The forge, fire, smithing, apprentices, siegecraft

Aliases: None

Domain Name: Solania/The Soulforge

Superior: Moradin

Allies: The Morndinsamman (except Abbathor and Deep Duerra), Kossuth, Gond, Flandal Steelskin, Hephaestus

Foes: Abbathor, Deep Duerra, Diirinka, Diinkarazan, evil giant &amp; goblinkin pantheons, Imix, Istishia, Olhydra

Symbol: Flame-wreathed hammer

Worshipper Alignment: LG, NG, CG, LN, N, CN


Youngest son of Moradin and Berronar, Tharmekhûl The Forge-Tender earned his epithet by aiding the All-Father at the Soul Forge, stirring the burning charcoal with his bare hands and blowing great gusts of air from his lungs to force air over the coals. It was Tharmekhûl’s skill and focus that allowed Moradin to focus his divine power on creating the First Dwarves.


Tharmekhûl is an introverted, focused master of the art and science of smithing and metallurgy. He is the fire of the forge, the flux binding all great craftsmanship, the hammer that beats the metal into its shape. His martial prowess and knowledge of defensive and offensive siegework is second only to Moradin himself. He rarely manifests to his followers, preferring to work through inspiration and minor manifestations. When he does manifest, his avatar frequently aids great smiths in creating legendary weapons or armor, or in the thick of battle, breaking a siege or holding the line with great fiery sweeps of his massive warhammer.

#**Tharmekhûl’s Avatar**

The Siegemaster of The Morndinsamman manifests as a great muscular azer (fire-dwarf), wearing finely-crafted mithril plate without a helm, with a great mithril tower shield. His hair and beard are made of fire, his eyes burn like white-hot coals, and his skin is as polished obsidian. He rarely casts spells in avatar form, but prefers fire-based spells, abjuration, alteration, and evocation. He grants and can cast spells from the spheres of all, fire, combat, creation, guardian, and protection.

He wields *Anviltamer*, an enchanted mithril warhammer that can dispel magic at will, enchant weapons and armor if used to smith the items, and can banish extraplanar entities 3 times per day on hit.

**5th Edition Stats:**

AC 24    Speed 40ft    HP 210 (32d10+100)    

STR 24(+7) DEX 20(+5) CON 20(+5) INT 16(+3) WIS 18(+4) CHA 18(+4)

Saves: STR +12 DEX +8 CON +10 WIS +8 CHA +8

Proficiency Bonus: +7

Skills: Perception +15, Insight +15, Arcana +10

Damage Immunities: Fire, Radiant, Poison, Necrotic, Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing from non-magical weapons

Condition Immunities: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Poisoned, Stunned

Senses: Truesight 120ft, passive perception 28

Languages: Dwarven, Common, Celestial, Ignan, Primordial

CR: 17

**Abilities:**

Innate Spellcasting (3/day). Tharmekhûl can innately cast any priest or wizard spells from the aforementioned schools (spell DC 19) . He is particularly fond of Investiture of Flame, Meteor Swarm, Flame Strike, Creation, and Animate Objects.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Tharmekhûl fails a Saving Throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
Magic Resistance. Tharmekhûl has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Magic Weapons. Tharmekhûl’s weapon attacks are magical.
Regeneration. Tharmekhûl regains 20 Hit Points at the start of his turn.

**Actions:**

Multiattack. Tharmekhûl makes three attacks with *Anviltamer*, his warhammer. He can replace one of these attacks with a shield bash.

*Anviltamer*. Melee weapon attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. Hit: 2d8+7 damage. Anviltamer casts dispel magic on the target when struck (spell DC 19). 

*Kadrin* (shield). Melee weapon attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. Hit: 1d8+7 damage, shove 5ft backwards, DC 19 DEX save to avoid being knocked prone.

Tharmekhûl can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one Legendary Action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn.

Attack. Attacks once with Anviltamer.
Banish (costs 2 actions). Casts banish on a target.
Firestorm (costs 2 actions). Releases fire in a 20-foot radius. All other creatures in that area must make a DC 19 Dex save, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, half on success.
Ballista Salvo. Three ballista bolts fly from a direction of his choosing, in a 60 ft range. +15 to hit, 3d8+7 piercing damage. This attack counts as magical for purposes of resistance. 

#**Other Manifestations**

Tharmekhûl manifests commonly involve a blast of heat as from a forge, an orange-white flame, or a shower of orange and red sparks, as struck from a heated weapon. The Forge-Tender’s favor on a mortal manifests as a mandala of orange and yellow flame, granting them immunity to fire, and hurting all non-dwarf creatures within a small radius about them. This aura also grants advantage on any skill check involving smithing or siegecraft.

Tharmekhûl is primarily served by azer (dwarves from the Elemental Plane of Fire), but the souls of fallen dwarf smiths form his Forgeguard, a company of einheriar loyal to him. Lantern archons, aasimon, fire elementals, and good-aligned efreeti also serve him. He manifests his pleasure in the blessing of particularly fine forging tools, and the discovery of deposits of coke, coal, and mithril. He manifests his displeasure when forge tools break, and coal turns to peat when touched.

#**Temples, Dogma, and Clergy**

There are no temples to The Apprentice. Rather, all dwarf forges are his holy ground. Where metal is forged, where heat is applied, where weapons are tempered; these are his sanctuaries. His Forge-Tenders, priests of Tharmekhûl, are weapon and armor smiths, one and all. They are Clerics of the Forge, and their hymns to their God ring out with each beat of the hammer, each hiss of tempered metal.

Every Dwarf forgemaster, whether clergy or layperson, lays a mithril plate inscribed with the flame-wreathed hammer of Tharmekhûl under the anvil of a newly-created forge. The first piece of armor or weapon made in that forge is ceremonially shattered. Prayers to The Forge-Tender implore him to bless the forge, that this first broken craft be the only flawed piece ever to be made over this anvil, and that every piece forevermore be blessed with indomitable strength, to protect dwarvenkind, and to strike down their enemies with great fury and precision.

The clergy of Tharmekhûl focus their efforts on improving dwarven forgecraft and educating weapon and armor smiths. Their philosophy centers around patience, perseverance, and hard work. 

“A strong work ethic will overcome the greatest obstacles.”

“The right pressure, applied with precision, is stronger than the mightiest blow.”

“Temper your emotions. Like the forge, too much heat ruins the blade.”

“Be like flux in your communities. Bind dwarvenkind together, for in unity we find strength.”

Forge-Tenders, when politics and public service call them to serve the community, usually become masters of smithing guilds, advisors to generals, or officers in siege engine units. Itinerant and adventurous clerics of Tharmekhûl frequently lead expeditions to reclaim lost dwarf forges, recover ancient artifacts, or travel to foreign lands to learn new forgecraft techniques.

#**Holy Days**

*Ghiluzkhebabmerag*, or Forge Day Festival, is the quintessential holy day for Tharmekhûl and all forge workers. Smiths quench their metalwork in thick, black Dwarf ale during this day, instead of the usual oil or ice-water. Smiths must make an exceptional item on this day in Tharmekhûl's name, and is usually gifted to a king or war-hero, in honor of their service.

*Hornmoot* is an annual spring tradition, where human and dwarf communities trade goods and precious gifts, forging new alliances and reaffirming old promises. Tharmekhûl's Forge-Tenders craft human armor and weapons specifically for this event, and gift these items to the human commanders in honor of their bonds of common defense of home and hearth. No return gift is expected, though frequently human clerics and mages will enchant dwarf crafts and produce magic items for the Stout Folk.

#**Cults &amp; Sects**

*Forgemasters*: The Forgemasters are a loose alliance of smith guildmasters, a secret society that spans across the world, even the multiverse. Their loyalty to each other knows no clan or other bounds; their shared beliefs override any other obligation. Between Forgemasters, there are no secrets of forgecraft. If one member finds a novel technique in smelting, forging, or tempering, all learn the technique within weeks or even days. Use of *sendings*, messenger spirits, and magical telepathy are common. Tharmekhûl blesses members of this cult with knowledge of smithing techniques, and the capability to pass on this knowledge to future generations. Thus are the realms of dwarfkind prepared for any threat.

*The Archaeotech Society*: Clerics of Tharmekhûl with an overriding wanderlust often join their local chapter of the Archaeotechs. Considered an adventurer's Guild of sorts, the Wanderers, as they are sometime known, fund and lead expeditions into Underdark Warren's, extraplanar locales, and even into Freespace, following lore and rumors of lost dwarven ruins. They attempt to collect lost lore, forgecraft, and legendary artifacts of dwarven make. They do this both to keep such power out of their enemies’ hands, and to recover them for use by their proper masters. Almost all of the Forge-tenders that join this society are Archaeologists by background, and Forge Clerics by trade. This eclectic combination of skills ensures they are indispensable in any such expeditions to potentially hostile lands.

#**Rumors &amp; Recent Events**

In 1385 DR (Forgotten Realms reckoning), all priests of Tharmekhûl lost their spellcasting ability. All current Forgemasters went mad or blind, and chaos erupted in the dwarven realms as a result. Forge tools and anvils in the great forges broke simultaneously. Amidst this chaos, certain high clerics of Moradin had visions of a knife in the smoke, and a life cut short.

An expedition of einheriar and archons, led by Haela Brightaxe herself, followed a trail across most of the Outer Planes, the Prime, and into the Para-Elemental Plane of Smoke. It was here they found the cold corpse of Tharmekhûl, dressed only in a shirt and breeches. How he came to be here, far from both his realm and his followers, and how he, a demigod, could be killed with only two knife wounds to his back, is a mystery that may never be solved. His weapon Anviltamer, shield, and wondrous armor was nowhere to be found. His body now lies in state in the Soulforge, awaiting resurrection, but it has been several weeks and he has yet to reconstitute himself. Meanwhile, Moradin himself has taken up his portfolio and stranded worshippers, and the lives of mortal dwarves slowly has returned to normal. What really happened, mortals may never know.",1,"Tharmekhûl, The Forge-Tender"

",1,Traveling Entertainment (The Show Must Go On)
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,18,515,"You've built the world, the players have built the characters and you've gone ahead and played the first session of the game! Things are going great, the players have characters and locations that they are interested in, and you just finished the hardest part of Dnd and got a game started. With that out of the way, the next step is figuring out the arc of the campaign, and getting players into the real thick of things. Creating a good session arc only requires one thing: interconnectivity. 

#Connect the Players to NPC's

If you want the players to care about your world and your story they need to have a connection to it. There are multiple ways to do this, but one of the most effective ways I have found to achieve this is through NPC's. Whether the NPC's are friendly, evil, or just weird, players like to connect to characters they can interact with. First, start with the characters your players wrote into their backstories. If they mention somebody, there is a good chance they want you to do something with it. Whether it be a friend, family, or even an antagonist if they took the time to write something down breath life into their backstory by adding those NPC's to the game. If they didn't write a backstory (as most players tend not to do) ask your players to provide with you with a few NPC's. I like to ask for 3 specific NPC's from my players, an ally, an antagonist, and a third one that fits the campaign (such as a family member or a contact). 



The next thing you can do to connect your players to the world is to identify what characters they interacted with most in the first session. Once you figure out who the players are most interested in, you can plan more about them, figure out their schedules, and maybe even what their plans are. My favorite thing to do is to introduce a villain in the first session, but have them get away before the players can kill them. Without fail, every time I have done this the players have dropped everything to chase after this one bad guy. 

When connecting the players to the world through NPC's, one thing you need to be extremely careful of is not killing off who your players care about. Death is a powerful motivator, but it should be used sparingly. If every character the players ever care about is killed to further the plot, your players will stop forming attachments because of the fear of losing them. They will no longer connect with the world, and won't be interested in the game. Use death sparingly, and make it matter when you do decide to kill someone that the players care about. 

#Planning the Story

Now that we have the characters figured out, the next part is connecting them all to create a compelling story. If you can all go back to 7th grade and remember the basic outline of a story, the idea of rising action leading into a climax followed by the denouement, you can then use this principle in your games. When planning an arc using this dramatic structure, you can create a compelling series of events that your players will be ecstatic to see every single week. Building up to the big bad (preferably someone the players have already developed a connection with) will help to create a climactic session, and make for a satisfying arc. 



Specifically, let's go over each of the functions of the dramatic arc. Starting with exposition, this is simply where you introduce the conflict and characters to the players. The players should meet all the major players in the upcoming arc, or at the very least learn about them. This shouldn't take very long, but you should feel free to take as much time as necessary to establish everything. If the players feel like they are lost halfway through the rising action all of the tension you will have built up will be lost, and you will have to go back to the beginning. 

Next comes the inciting incident. Find out a reason for the players to go on an adventure and give it to them. Whether it's a mysterious benefactor offering piles of gold, or a loved one going missing, you need to give the players a reason to go out there. Choose something that is fitting for all of the players, or create individual inciting moments for everyone so that the entire party has a stake in the upcoming events.



The rising action is one of the more difficult pieces to maintain. Depending on how long you want the adventure to last, the rising action could be as long as one session or several years. The key to good rising action is giving the players successes at multiple points in the journey, but not allowing them to finish their final goal until the tension becomes nearly unbearable. One way I like to think of the rising action is if you were to zoom in on the dramatic structure, you would see the same pattern of rising action, climax, and denouement on a smaller scale. By having multiple stories that all lead up to the final event, you can make the final event even grander than it could have possibly ever been imagined. 

Now comes the climax. A satisfying climax needs stakes. If doing nothing achieves the same ending as doing something, your climax will be empty and meaningless. Fortunately, if you do the rising action well your climax should have plenty of stakes. Stakes is also dependent on how connected the players are to the thing at stake. Saying that the bad guy will destroy the world means nothing to the players if the world means nothing to them. If destroying the world means the NPC's that the players have grown attached to are at risk, then the players will care, but you have to add that human element and help the players realize why it is important for them to stop the bad guy.

Finally, we come to the denouement also known as the falling action. This part should be even shorter than the exposition, and should simply serve as a way to tie loose ends together. Ask the players what they wish to do with their characters and finish off the campaign with a neat little bow. 

#Conclusion

Planning a good session arc is primarily about creating connections. Once the players feel like the world and characters in it are meaningful to them they can have a much better relationship with the story. Nobody wants to watch a tv show where they don't care about anyone in the story. The same is true for Dnd. Once your players have that connection to the world, you can start to introduce a story, and as long as you follow the basic rules of storytelling you can create a compelling narrative that your players will want to see every single week. Thank you all for reading I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

Accents (accurate or butchered) are a great way to differentiate NPCs. But accents are a single tool in a box brimming with more options you can use to make a world of NPC with unique voices.

&amp;#x200B;

These are seven factors you can use with your normal voice-- or an accent-- to make NPCs sound unique. You don’t have to use all of these, but combining three or more can help flesh out a character’s voice and better match their personality.

&amp;#x200B;

The seven factors:

* Word choice
* Tone
* Speed
* Inflection
* Specific quirks
* Volume
* Posture

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Word choice

* Do they use small words, large words, or a mixture? 
* When speaking to someone they like or dislike, when do they invoke their name? At the beginning of their sentence? Do they avoid using names for any reason?
* Do they give people nicknames instead of addressing them by their name or “you?” If so, what kinds? Are they for people they like, dislike, or both? Why do they use nicknames?
* How much slang do they use?
* Do they avoid or use filler words?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tone

* Is there general tone lighthearted? Distressed? Does it have undertones that reflect their demeanor, such as worry or hope? 
* Are they trying to please the person they’re talking to or get them to move on? 
* Do they sound stressed or relaxed?
* Are they excited to speak to this person? Upset? Indifferent?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Speed

* How fast or slowly do they speak? 
* What makes them speed up or slow down? Excitement, fear, boredom?
* Does their speed reflect how much they contemplate their words before choosing them?
* Why do they speak quickly? Are they distracted? Is it part of their culture or family? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Inflection

* What words in a sentence do they emphasize and why?
* Do they stress the name of the person they’re talking to? Do they stress the point they are trying to make? Do they stress filler words? 
* Is there a rhythm to the words they stress? Or do they stress words that have a particular meaning to what they’re saying?
* Do they passively stress words or do it on purpose?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Specific quirks

* Do they commonly use sound effects instead of specific words or phrases? Such as “Things were like \*explosion noise\*!”
* Do they laugh reflexively? Perhaps when they’re nervous, uncertain, or happy?
* Are they constantly distracted or hyper focused on the person they’re talking to?
* Do they address the group or individuals within it?
* Do they always pause to let people finish? Do they constantly interrupt others?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Volume

* What causes them to increase or decrease their volume? Perhaps when they’re excited or intimidated?
* Does their normal environment effect their volume (such as someone who constantly works in loud places)?
* Do they raise the volume of their voice regularly for specific moments, such as someone’s name, a chuckle, or the last word of the sentence?
* Are they loud for a specific reason, such as to make sure everyone can hear them clearly or to intimidate the person they’re talking to?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Posture

* How do they stand or sit? Do they cross their legs? Do they man spread? Do they do the [Riker Maneuver? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIGhYMwRgs) 
* Do they talk with their hands?
* Who or what do they look at while speaking? Does that change based on the subject matter?
* Do they try to make physical contact with the person they are talking to? If so, why and when?
* Are they actively doing other things while speaking?
* Do they shift or change positions? If so, why and when?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So let’s talk examples. Frank Oz is the man behind a suite of famous Muppets, such as Fozzie Bear, Grover, Miss Piggy, Bert, Animal, Cookie Monster, and Sam the Eagle. If you listen to them, it’s clear they’re voiced by the same person. And while some of them have very similar voices, I’ve never mistaken any of them for another. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fozzie Bear and Bert have very similar voices. Fozzie as an edge of excitement while Bert sounds mildly annoyed. Fozzie is expressive, while Bert is reserved. Fozzie wants to please his audience, whether it’s one person or a group, while Bert addresses people directly. Fozzie wildly uses his body, while Bert often keeps his shoulders stiff. Fozzie also sometimes reaches out to touch the person he’s speaking too, while Bert generally keeps his hands to himself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Animal and Cookie monster are very similar as well. Both characters shout, their word choices are limited, and neither speaks in the first person. However, Animal likes to repeat words to prove a point, Cookie Monster does not (except “omnomnomnom” while eating cookies). Animal also almost exclusively talks in broken sentences, where Cooking Monster can speak clearly when talking about a passion of his (like cookies) and uses “me instead of “I”. Animal has a constant volume except for rare exceptions, while Cookie Monster has a broader range. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sam The Eagle’s word choices are very proper. Filler words rarely enter his vocabulary. He’s stern. He gets straight to the point. His volume is mostly constant. He pauses to make a point, and sometimes emphasizes the word before the pause to draw further attention to it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So when you’re building NPCs, or having to make one on the fly, try this: Have this chart handy, take about 3 or more of those factors, and use them to form a voice for the character. As always, make sure they have some sort of personality too, and let your choices influence that. Or if you start with a personality and make choices on the chart based on that.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this was useful to you. Have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,30,79,"Quick post here, I wanted to create player inspired investigation tables for when a DM runs sandbox content but doesn't want the party to spend all day searching every nook and cranny of a vignette or an area that was meant to just serve as flavor. 

[Pretty Version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ivFBatW-ePdxKw6NzbkMg_7RexNuZdoH)

We’ve all been in that moment where you just want to scream and say, *Seriously, there is nothing there, stop investigating every stone in this wall for secret passages and every crate for treasure, we’ve been stuck in this garbage-filled alleyway for three hours.* We might be good at improv content, but everyone has a limit. The goal of these tables and quick investigation system is to remedy improv drain while preserving the sandbox.

**First**, put the creative agency on the *curious* (read: tenaciously obstinate) player - turn their investigation of a macguffin into a question: ""***What do you hope to find***?""

**Then** you determine likelihood (depending on how realistic their response is) and set a DC. I would say stick with the 5e chart for difficulty on skill checks. For reference:

**Skill Check DC Ratings**

|Very Easy|5|
|:-|:-|
|Easy|10|
|Medium or Standard|15|
|Hard|20|
|Very Hard|25|
|Nearly Impossible|30|

**Finally**, let them roll their investigation skill check **one time** *for the entire scene.* This is how a DM can break out of the pitiful state where *no stone is left unturned*. If they crit succeed, then they *find exactly what they are looking for*, if they beat the DC they *find something close or helpful along the same lines*, if they miss DC but not badly (at least half) they *find something that doesn't help doesn't hurt* (but might come into play later), and if they fail without achieving half of DC something happens and it *makes their current objective more challenging or complicated*. Crit fail is a *hard move* (befuddled, ambushed, trapped, injured, discovered or exposed).

I’ve included some tables below to help with improv on the fails - the successful rolls don’t really work with generic tables because it depends on what the player is specifically looking for (this will have to be all on DM improv based on the situation in the story). I also did not include treasure as there are plenty of treasure tables and apps that already exist.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,42,"My campaign involved a lot of 'tears in reality', portals linked to random planes. Plus, I love running elementals as enemies. Both those things could use a bit of randomisation to keep things interesting, so I ended up developing [this](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rkBRwJi8Km) document to help.

I've weighted it according to likelihood as felt appropriate to me. Like you have the biggest probability to go into one of the 'reflections' of the prime material plane. after that, you have the elemental planes, which are right next to it in the cosmology, etc etc. Feel free to change any of the probabilities as you see fit. I've also included a diagram of my own depicting the elemental planes to help visualise it all.

It's missing tables for all the layers of the outer planes, because that would be... a lot of work, that I haven't got to. So if your players happen to go there (5% chance, the outer planes are distant and hard to reach!), just improvise. They're most likely to hit the first layer anyway, but feel free to mix things up and send them deeper.

Hope that helps some of you guys!",1,"Ever needed to generate a random element, or pick a random plane? These tables will help"

# Introduction

As I have researched many dragons and will continue to do so one aspect of many dragons is the breath weapon.  While breath weapons are a dangerous adaptation of many dragons they do not exclusively possess such an ability.  Cryo/Pyro hydra, Wyverns, Chimera, and many other creatures possess the ability to expel a dangerous substance from their mouths.  However, Dragons possess the most dangerous and powerful varieties.  

This the best attempt to this day to record and understand how such a breath weapon works.  While each creature may have unique ways in which a breath weapon works to a certain level there are enough similarities that we can draw comparisons.

--------------------------------------------

# Physiology

-------------------------------

## What Classifies as a Breath Weapon?

The simple answer is that Breath Weapons are an expulsion of a harmful, to other creatures, substance either for attacking or defending oneself.  This can include everything from naturally created acid, venom, poison, heated water, fire, lighting and even in some cases magical energy.  Despite the nature of the breath weapon all of the mechanics in the expulsion are usually non-magical and entirely biological.

There are 3 key factors to a breath weapon, Storage, Production, and Controlled Expulsion from the mouth.  In order to be classified as a Breath Weapon, all must be true. This is why some creatures who simply spew with little expulsion like common flies do not count as a Breath Weapon.

------------------------------------

## Production

All Breath Weapons are either entirely created internally such as Black Dragon acid or partially such as the electrical energy of a Blue Dragon.  Production is usually handled by a specialized organ that diverts excess nutrients, energy, or even fluids to combine with other elements or agents to create a volatile substance.  This organ is usually connected to many systems throughout the body however at times can be directly connected to the kidneys as a backup filter.  The production organ is usually small and in a centralized location.  However, the more systems the production organ is attached to the less centralized it is.  Some dragons have specialized nodules in their veins to act as smaller production organs that accumulate into a larger one.  This adaptation is only seen internally and rarely can be seen for any reason without cutting into the specimen.

While many varieties of production exist they all do the same process in pulling out the components for the breath weapon to be combined into the final state.  Using the earlier examples naturally created acid from bodily functions by a Black Dragon.  This acid is then combined with water and stomach acid to create a highly corrosive poison/venom used in its Breath Weapon and has a different process for the venomous tail stings.  Blue Dragons are a good example of using exterior forces mixed with interior forces.  Blue dragons collect and redirect the electrical energy it makes naturally as well as has the ability to harness external electricity through specialized collectors in the large head horn.  The collectors are much like the production organs and work in tandem to create the intense electrical blasts they can use.

------------------------------------------------

## Storage

All breath weapons need to be stored at least for some amount of time if even seconds.  This area allows for the faculties used in expelling a Breath Weapon to operate.  There can be many storage organs or areas in a creature and they are also usually visible.  Most commonly stored in the base of the throat or in the chest cavity they can be seen especially just before expelled.  Usually referred to as sacs these areas are present in dragons and wyverns very prominently.  In the case of Red Dragons, the Breath Sac can be seen glowing bright red even through the yellow underbelly scales just before blasting.

These sacs are usually much like a gullet or stomach and need to have substance in them in order to use a Breath Weapon.  Dragons are notoriously able to use their Breath Weapon frequently but with limits. The limiting factor is enough production to refill the Breath Sac.  These sacs can be removed from a creature and in some cases harnessed for their properties.  In the case of wyverns, this is very common as both sac and production can occur in the same organ.  This suggests that wyverns have a very primal method of Breath Weapon Production.

---------------------------------------------------

## Expulsion Mechanisms 

As with all Breath Weapons, the key to making it a weapon is the ability to use it in an offensive manner.  Dragons in particular and Hydras that do possess the ability to have the most advanced mechanisms to do so.  Combining with the incredible neck muscles that ripple from the base of the neck upwards and incredible lung force and capacity they can blast creatures some times up to 50 yards away.  By gauging their breath or even learning to control their neck tension greater or smaller distances and forces can be achieved with practice.  Many dragons pride themselves in this practiced art and will often have a favorite ""firing"" range to demonstrate their power.  This can be used in intimidation most easily.  

Wyverns and less-advanced systems usually have no such control and will always fire at full tilt.  This can be easily taken advantage of in tactical decision making as the speed and distances can be predicted if well known.  Despite being less advanced this makes them no less deadly, well to a humanoid.

All expulsion mechanisms have a mostly physical nature in their use.  Highly magical dragons and other creatures still rely on physical biology to utilize their breath weapons.

--------------------------------------------------------

# Types and Examples of Breath Weapons


Most Breath Weapons operate in the ways described in detail below.  While some creatures are able to change the way in which their breath weapon is expelled most of the time a creature as limited ways of using their breath weapons.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Line of Breath

Line Breath Weapons are the furthest reaching but most narrow methods of expulsion.  Usually, this straight line will stop and dissipate or disperse upon striking an object or target.  However certain varieties, such as Blue Dragon Wizards, have learned to extend their breath weapon to chain through or to new targets.  These kind of breath weapons are far more accurate in their use and more deadly in the sense of single target destructiveness.  However, they are the least effective, usually, against large groups of enemies.

Examples:

* Blue Dragons, Lightning Breath

* Black Dragons, Acid Breath

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cone of Breath

By far the most common Breath weapon is a cone of breath away from the mouth of the attacker.  Often the cone of influence will be stopped by objects or various creatures.  The idea to hide behind cover, especially an enchanted shield is the most common tactic to avoiding a Red Dragon's cone of Fire.  They can hit many targets and do excessive amounts of damage.   While lines do more damage generally, don't tell a Red Dragon, cone breaths are most often fatal if unprotected anyway.

Examples

* Red and Gold Dragons, Cone of Fire

* Silver and White Dragons, Cone of Cold

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gas Clouds

Less common but still effective are the gas breath weapons.  These breath weapons can fill whole rooms or larger areas however like any gas can be less effective the more diluted the Breath Weapon is.  Most often less immediately deadly these Breath Weapons are usually used in escaping rather than offense, although the Green Dragon's cunning can put that mentality to the test.


Examples

* Green Dragon, Chlorine or Poison Gas

* Gold Dragon, Weakening Gas

* Silver Dragon, Paralyzation Gas

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pitch or Ball Breath Weapons

The most primitive yet very effective methods of Breath Weapon are the ball of a substance ejected usually at high speeds.  Unlike other Breath Weapons, they are not for extended durations but a short blast expending all possible sac contents simultaneously.  This, however, makes for the fastest recharging breath weapons and thus used much more often.  Creatures with multiple storage sacs, such as some wyverns, can use this to devastating effect.

Examples:

* Wyverns, Pitch of Fire, Cold, or Acid

* Grey Dragons, Pitch of Caustic Ooze

* Orange Dragons, Pitch of explosive Ooze


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Manipulation by Magic

While not common and almost exclusively done by highly trained or adept dragons Breath Weapons can be magically enhanced or manipulated to not only change properties but also shape and effect.  Here are some interesting findings along the way.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Bearers of the White Flame

As discovered during Red Dragon research, some Red Dragons who've dedicated their lives to their own power have enhanced their Breath Weapon beyond the already incredible limits of their fire breath.  Ignoring even fire immunities this white fire is extremely dangerous and has yet to be matched in sheer destructive power.

---------------------------------------------

## Shadow Swords

Shadow Dragons are very adept at manipulating their own breath weapons and this seems to the be most extraordinary use.  Manifesting the negative energy they expel into a sword that they use to fight alongside them is both powerful and complex.  The swords are usually the dragon's size or larger and impressively powerful cleaving larger monster in twain.

------------------------------------------------

## Blue Dragon Chain Lightning

Using their knowledge of magic alongside their lighting breath a Blue Dragon can take away the single target disadvantage of the line of lighting and chain it to many foes.  Most often in their lairs, they will even chain between lighting rods set up to further their use for even miles through underground passages.

---------------------------------------------------

## Ice Spike Spray

White Draong are usually more straightforward in their attacks and rarely take the time to plan an attack or manipulate things.  However, this is not true for all White Dragons and a common method of alteration is to narrow their fast freezing spray creating ice spikes that pierce even heavily armored foes.  These spikes can not only puncture the foe but also pin them down.

---------------------------------------------------

## Gold Dragon Flame Whips

A unique way of magically altering a breath is to bind foes in fire whips that both burn and restrain foes.  Another advanced technique these whips of fire take concentration to use and thus limit their use of their deadly breath weapon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Overview of the Guide

DM Development Guides are designed to enhance flavor and mechanics for a more detailed world and player engagement. The devil is in the details as the saying goes, and thus the guides will incorporate lore, background and mechanics that are easy to insert in any campaign. Each guide is designed to work together or individually to help a DM grow their world to the level of detail they wish. The guides could even work in the hands of a player who wants information to use in role play of a character that is proficient in the topic of focus. The different topics will range from wilderness biology and ecology, survival and medicine, geosciences, to urban civics and economics.

This guide is about signals and codes. Communication is key for any collaborative environment. The world will not fill with life unless the actors have a way to interact and communicate with the world and each other. This is especially true for role playing games - signals and codes create strong, yet subtle, connections among players and environmental elements as well as intrigue.

# Signals and Codes

*Watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places.* 

**Purposes for Signals**

Signals and signs serve multiple purposes in life. In a role playing game, they serve as the primary method for a DM to introduce story elements to the players around the table. Visions, messages, conversation all play an important part of creating engagement - sometimes by providing context, and sometimes by obscuring it with mystery.

*To attract attention*

&gt;Signals designed to attract attention are usually motivated by distress or persuasive appeal. The moments when an individual or a group needs to communicate clearly over a great distance, or to many people at one time. The goal with these types of signals are to be noticed.

*To avoid attention*

&gt;These messages are often clandestine or meant to be passed in secret. While their delivery or display might draw attention, their true meaning is, by design, obscured or encoded in some way to only allow the specific intended audience to retrieve the true message. Cryptography and Cryptolects are specifically designed for clandestine motives - these methods seek to communicate messages while securing the content of the message in secrecy.

**Methods for Signal Delivery**

&gt;*Visual*   
&gt;  
&gt;Types of visual signals include hand and finger gestures, body language, flags, written messages, and any methods that rely on color or light. Visual signals are the most common. They are most advantageous for clandestine affairs when stealth is required, or when a signal needs to remain for a perpetual time like a mark of warning or a directional guide marker on a trail.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Auditory*  
&gt;  
&gt;Auditory signals focus on sounds or patterns of sounds. Spoken language obviously falls into this category, but it can also include any system of taps, clicks or other audible sound designed to send a message. Auditory signals are best when visual connections are impossible because of darkness, distance, or restricted movement that would prevent other types of communication.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Tactile*   
&gt;  
&gt;A message sent through texture would be missed by prying eyes and ears. Braille uses a system of raised dots that can be read by feeling the patterns with fingertips. Additionally, a clever tactile communicator could use a sticky residue, temperature or some other textured substance to deliver clandestine messages while evading detection from any visual and auditory monitoring.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Olfactory*  
&gt;  
&gt;Smell is the most challenging signal, but the most instinctive. Smells preclude many happenings in the surroundings, like smoke and fire for instance. While it is typically unnecessary to try and deliver secret messages with scents, applied with subtlety, like marking a target or leaving markers on a trail,  these methods can be the most challenging to perceive and decode. 

**Coded Messages**

&gt;*Symbolic Messages in Plain Language*  
&gt;  
&gt;Some methods of code don’t attempt to obscure the language, but simply apply abstract meaning symbolically to everyday expressions to deliver coded messages. Thieves’ Cant is a great example of this type of communication (a cryptolect). While it is something that is still risky as it is a static dialect and authorities or other prying ears with the awareness can easily intercept communication passed through this method.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Plain Messages Coded with Abstract Dialect*  
&gt;  
&gt;Cryptography is all about taking a plainly worded message and altering the language or characters of the communication to obscure the plain meaning. In other words, this method of encryption applies code to an otherwise plain set of instructions or information. This method is more secure than a cryptolect, but also requires more care, coordination and effort to set up. See the OTP encryption system in mechanics for an example.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Passive or Dead Messages*  
&gt;  
&gt;Camouflage can sometimes be the best strategy if the messages are simple and easy to hide. A mark on the right post, a flag raised over a dock, a seemingly random stack of stones near the water well can all deliver simple messages without the need to apply a code or a shady dialect. Additionally, this type of message persists so the two or more figures in contact don’t even have to share proximity to communicate. 

**Applicable Tools and Skills**

&gt;*Semaphore (signal flags)*  
&gt;  
&gt;Semaphore flags are universal land flag system. The square flags have a field divided diagonally with red and yellow (the red filling the upper hoist). The flags are held and arranged in a circular pattern, similar to hands on a clock, to signal different letters and send messages across visual distances. Certainly there are other flag systems or lanterns in the windows like Paul Revere, but Semaphore flags work to send simple messages visually at distance. Not to be confused with nautical flag communication systems, where those flags have varied designs to deliver more complex messages at sea.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Smoke Signals*  
&gt;  
&gt;Not the most subtle way to communicate, but when an adventurer is trying to get noticed smoke signals can certainly get the job done. It is not as simple as lighting a fire, but, as one would expect, a steady campfire is the first thing to set up. Then, all a stranded adventurer needs is some green brush (it makes white smoke that is easier to see in the sky) and a wet cloak or blanket. Throw the wet cover on top of the fire until smoke is no longer rising, then in a swift motion from the corners lift the cover off the fire and release a tight cloud of smoke (this is the signal), replacing the cover briefly to create separation or a break for the next smoke signal. Use a longer break between groups of signals to repeat the desired message. The general code on the trail is one solitary signal before a break to simply announce location; two rapid signals grouped with breaks to show all is well; and three signals in quick succession with breaks to call for immediate aid.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Peddler’s French*  
&gt;  
&gt;In the early 1500's an anonymous publication called *Liber Vagatorum* included a glossary of terms and expressions commonly used to describe vagrancy in the underworld at the time. In the preface, penned in 1528 by Martin Luther, he refers to this dialect as *thieves’ cant*. While not actually a dialect of French (the original publication surfaced in Germany) it was probably translated as *Peddler’s French* in the English version in a deliberate effort to insult the French. Luther described the book as a Quarto (the sheet, or leaf, is folded four times to make pages resulting in a book about 9.5 inches by 12 inches), printed in red and having an impression on the title page of a beggar and his family made with a wood cutout. Martin Luther’s preface attempts to present the cryptolect as a sign of warning and ends with, *therefore, whosoever hear these words, let him be warned, and do good to his neighbour.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Tactical Hand Signals*  
&gt;  
&gt;These visual signals are great for adventurers who want to maintain silence, but still coordinate with their party. Whether stalking or being stalked, messages sent reliably down a line or back through the marching order will improve reaction ability and keep the party together. The key is to keep the signals simple and only use them for the most important messages and tactical information. For instance, an arm extended to the side with fist clenched and thumb pointed down signals that someone, potentially an enemy, has been sighted. The all clear signal is an arm extended in the same manner with fist clenched, but the thumb pointed up. To signal an all around defense, or otherwise to set up a defensible position at the current location, stop and point at the ground and draw a circle with your hand - this should signal to the party to set up sentries in this location while the party checks the map or inspects an obstacle. This signal may also be used on a continued march to point out defensible fall back or rendezvous positions along the trail in the case of separation or retreat.

**Mechanics and Progression**

### One Time Pad (OTP)

The One Time Pad (OTP) is an encryption system that cannot be cracked by outside investigation. The encryption is set up with a random number sequence as the key and each key sequence is only used one time. It is simple to work with as each letter is assigned a standard number (A is 01 and Z is 26) but don’t scoff yet because a random key is going to be added later to create the encryption. Let’s work with this message.

&gt;*MEET AT DAWN* = 1305 0520 0120 0401 2314 2424

To make a key - write a random series of letters (it needs to be longer than the message) and then go down the string and copy the numbers from the standard conversion (A is 01 and Z is 26) grouping the key in two character blocks (it will look like a Visa or MasterCard number with each character block resulting in four coded numbers). Ultimately, the two-letter block grouping will be used to further obscure the plaintext of the message as well. 

&gt;*JWPMPSWUMSPFGPSS* = 1023 1613 1619 2321 1319 1606 0716 1919

This is our key - we need two copies, one for the sender, one for the recipient. To encrypt the message, add the key on top of the coded message. Here is the real brilliance of the OTP: the starting block will be different every time (don’t ever let parts of the key overlap or be used in more than one message, make a new key instead). I am going to code this message with 1613 (PM) as the starting block on the key - let’s pretend we already communicated with this key up to the 1023 (JW) block. Add using Fibonacci addition (no carrying so go with whatever would end up in the ones place 9+2 = 1)

&gt;Message - \[starting key block PM\] “ME ET AT DA WN xx”  
&gt;  
&gt;Plaintext:   1613 1305 0520 0120 0401 2314 2424  
&gt;  
&gt;Add Key:              1619 2321 1319 1606 0716 1919  
&gt;  
&gt;Encrypted: 1613 2914 2841 1439 1007 2020 3333

Decrypting it without the key (using the standard letter to number conversion) would give - PM 29N 2841 N39 JG TT 3333 - in other words, complete gibberish.

Notice how the first block on the plaintext and the encrypted message is a code block on the key - that tells the recipient where to start on the key (use the first block after the one given) when they want to decode the message. All the recipient has to do is line up the key with the encrypted message and apply Fibonacci subtraction (no negatives, add 10 to the minuend first if the result would be negative) and decode the message. 

Some things to keep in mind when using this type of code: *always spell out the words for any numbers* (a must for one through twenty six) as the code assigns number groups to each letter; it’s smart to *repeat any negative commands* (avoid rpt avoid the meet); and *use a single “x” to mark the end of a sentence (and “xx” for the end of the message)* as there will be no coded expression for punctuation. This method, provided proper measures are taken to secure the creation, delivery, application and destruction of keys, will never be cracked.

# History

Across the River Po was once the Shremsing Fields, a vast rolling landscape of green hills, tumbling rivers and pockets of hardwood trees. An idyllic land, it was peopled by a gentle race of humans who wished only to farm, hunt, and live peacefully with nature. They were shepherded by a branch of the global druidic order called The Canathane, and a circle of standing stones once graced the highest hilltop. 

During the Chaos Wars, the renegade daughter of a powerful drow priestess led a retreat into the Fields, a desperate maneuver in the face of formidable odds from the Shining Alliance. This drow, called Rakasha, led her army across the river and subjugated the populace into slavery. She forced them to build her a castle while her forces stymied the opposition at the single bridge leading into the region. Her rule was tyrannical and cruel and the peoples rose up and slew her, but her rage could not be quenched and she was transformed into a Banshee and with her dying breath, cursed the land. 

The curse spun through time and space and an arcane font of swamp-water geysered into the castle from some Abyssal rift and it soon filled the castle, and spilled out into the lands, and it came with the force of a relentless sea pouring into the Fields and soon drowned all the lowlands and uncounted animals and people and plants died. Now it was to be called the Skelking Moors, where Rakasha's dread will has kept the drowned populace under her thrall, even in undeath her will is powerful. All who come here are subject to her keen senses, which permeate every living (and unliving) thing and show her all that transpires within her domain. 

# The People

Though the whole area is now swampland, there are many areas of land above the surface of the marsh, and there are many areas of interest (so to speak) and a few scattered gatherings of people, but nothing so fancy as to be called a town. Small villages, at best, are to be found here, and the people who do live here do not like outsiders. The Mistmire, as they call themselves, are a loose confederation of the descendants of the survivors of Rakasha's curse, though some demi-humans are still here who were present for the catastrophe. They *cannot* leave this place, as part of the curse, and so they have mostly died, horribly, as the dangers of the swamp are myriad. Those that survived have become fiercely stubborn and pragmatic people with no room for sentimentality or ""do-gooders"" come to slay the Banshee Witch - all who have tried have failed, and now they join The Risen, those who have fallen and now serve only Her. 

The Mistmire has specialized soldiers and defenders among them - skills built up over generations, and refined through constant peril from the swamp denizens. Muckfighters are the most common among them, and they are most uncommon warriors. Rangers whose favored terrain is swamp and who's favored enemies are *every creature* in the swamp, combined with the scaling speed of a monk, they are a sight to behold. The Bogweavers are druids and mages, combined. Able to create concealing illusions and quiet footsteps and paddle strokes, the Weavers are defenders of the People. Bogshadows are truly rare, Rogues all, they also have shadow-magic to conceal themselves from the perils of the swamp. If they are met by outsiders, the Mistmire will do all they can to avoid contact, but if forced, they will be eager to rid themselves of any unwanted company. If they can be persuaded to find some large gain in an undertaking, they are loyal and fierce allies. 

# The Witch and her Thralls

The Moors are an extension of the will of the banshee with, Rakasha. She languishes within her castle, unable to leave her fallen form, but she sees and hears everything that transpires in her domain. She can force her will into any creature, living or dead, and treat them as a puppet. Those who are immune to the Ichor River's aura of hopelessness (see 
""Terrain"", below) are not able to be controlled by Rakasha, as they have developed psionic walls that shut out her constant enticements. 

While in the Moors, the whispered entreaties from Rakasha will begin immediately. She croons, and cajoles, and sends intruders images of beautiful men or women, whom entreat the victim to lie down (underwater usually) and join them forever and ever. Rakasha pleads for them to give up, to submit, to seek peace, to lie down and surrender to bliss and forget their struggles and fears. She is relentless, and hot-tempered, and will often grow very angry and threaten the victims with horrible images of themselves or loved ones, plucked from memories, dying by the Banshee's hand, or by one of her many minions. 

Rakasha's lover was also killed in the uprising, and his name is Makabe, once a powerful sorcerer, he now exists as a Ghost, and protects Rakasha's remains against intruders. He can be banished if his own remains can be uncovered within the castle. 

There are two apex predators that once lived in the Fields, but now are undead thralls of Rakasha. One is a black dragon called Muckskull-the-Foul, and the other is a Fog Giant named Unlub-the-Mad. Both will answer Rakasha's call if her castle is invaded, or if any intruders seem to be particularly powerful. 

The Risen are the banshee's most powerful weapon. All who died now rest under the waters, and can be called to rise and fight, sometimes in the hundreds, if the Witch wills it. These zombies are also under a powerful curse, and are rightfully called Drowned Zombies, because they each exude an *aura of drowning* around them, in a radius of 20'. Anyone inside the aura must make a Constitution saving throw against a 20 DC, or suffer 5 points of Constitution damage, as they begin to drown. At 0 Constitution, the character dies. They are stronger than normal zombies, doing double or triple the listed damage for zombies, and they act as a swarm - they cannot be surprised, or flanked. 

They mostly move underwater, slowly (10'/round), but without pause and move as a normal zombie on land. They will pursue prey until they are destroyed, or the prey is killed and joins the ranks of the Risen. 

# The Terrain

### The Ichor River

This is the name given to the Arcane Font's waters that were created by the curse. It is only a sluggish dribble now, but it still feeds the ever-growing swamp (which moves at 1/30th of a foot every year). The waters act as a conduit for Rakasha's will, and the Ichor Rivers carries that dread power into all parts of the swamp. The river causes the Moors to radiate with hopelessness (as the Symbol spell). Anyone caught in the swamp must roll a Wisdom saving throw versus a 15 DC every 7 days. If the save fails, the creature will become filled with despair, realizing Rakasha is too strong to fight, sit down and give up (additional saves are allowed every 24 hours thereafter). Starvation or the local predators will finish the poor creature off to become yet another victim of the Moors’ utter gloom. The Mistmire are immune to this effect, and will not warn outsiders of it unless allied with them. 

# The Regions

The swamp itself is divided into three sections - the small northeastern portion is called the Stinking Quags, the larger southeastern portion is known as the Festering Fens, and its where most of the Mistmire dwell, and the huge western portion is often called the Bogs of Sorrow, or The Witch's Quag. 

### The Stinking Quags

Bubbling pools of methane and sulfur dominate this region, and quicksand is abundant. Vampiric Mists nest here and drift on the odiferous winds. Vapor Rats, too, thrive here, and Giant Lizards, Boobrie and Catoblepas fight for food with Mudmen, Needlemen and the lone Meenlock, or two. Will o' Wisps and Bullywugs have started to increase in number in the last decade or two.  

**Areas of Interest**: An abandoned lumber yard. Ruins of a Temple to a neutral deity. Ruins of a fort. An obelisk.

### The Festering Fens

This is a dark and heavily-canopied region, where mangrove trees and cypress choke out the light and scrawny pines cluster on half-sunken hilltops. The Mistmire's unnamed villages are not the only habitation, as small bands of Lizardmen also dwell here, and make constant war on the People. Black Fly swarms torment anything they can catch, and Stirge, Volts, Basilisk and Brown Puddings fight for food with Eblis, Giant Centipedes and Dragonflies, Giant Snakes and Leeches, and the cunning bands of Thorks, with a Froghemoth or two to keep everything in balance. A few wise and ancient Galeb Duhr dwell here, asleep for centuries.

**Areas of Interest**: 4 Mistmire villages. An old mining camp. An abandoned mill. A flooded cavern. 

### The Bogs of Sorrow (Witch's Quag)

The most familiar type of swamp in your mind's eye, this huge region is home to the largest number of Risen, as well as handfuls of Shambling Mounds, Obliviax, Brown Puddings, Trolls, Ghouls, Ghasts, Apparitions, Ghosts and Revenants. All the other creatures mentioned in the other regions can also be found here, in smaller numbers, especially Vapor Rats, who can be found in all corners of the Moors. 

**Areas of Interest**: A cemetary. A standing circle of stones. An abandoned monastery. Ruins of a foundry. The Castle of Rakasha.

The Castle is located near the center of the Quagmire, and is hidden by powerful illusions. There is a small black berry that grows near the region's borders. If a handful are ingested (poison 10/20, save vs DC 14), they allow the castle to be seen for 24 hours. 

# Rakasha's Castle

The castle is haunted by Rakasha’s banshee. She wails once a night for 1 hour and never at the same time, but always between sunset and sunrise. The walls of the castle are leaning on one another like drunken old men. They are held together with rotten moss, bugspit, and Rakasha’s will.

The whole place is damp and smells like decay. Everyone who sleeps here will have nightmares and awaken cold, damp and uneasy, no matter what precautions are taken to prevent this. In addition, the campsite and adventurer’s belongings will have been “meddled” with during the night, even if a watch is kept (fires will be blown out, blankets tossed, boots dunked in water, etc…). The whole place feels and acts haunted and restless.

### Destroying the Banshee

If Rakasha can be forced to remain on the Material Plane she can be destroyed. If allowed to flee to the Astral Plane, she will heal to full health over the next 24 hours. If she is destroyed, the curse is lifted and the lands are drained of the dread swamp waters and all the undead will collapse into bones. 

Her mortal remains are hidden somewhere within the castle, and protected by a powerful illusion. She will call on Makabe, and any other nearby creatures to aid her if she is assaulted.

Some thoughts. This is not a faith I would have an easy time participating in with my characters. It definitely skews into sketchier, more traditionally-evil territory. But there is sometimes merit in ripping off the bandaid even though it can be painful, and that's what I've aimed for a bit here. While the deity might lean heavily into causing pain, there is space here for this faith to be useful even if it's not widely loved. 

A note to edgy players that enjoy exploring that very gray area in games. Kindly don't be a jerk to other people and don't use this material to be That Guy. If everybody at the table is in for grimdark edgelord behavior, then by all means go for it, but check in with the other players and make sure everybody is having a good time. Respect your friends and their boundaries.

*It is understandable that Bane is widely feared, but that is unfair to the Black Lord. Brutality gives us the strength we need to make the decisions and take the actions that are difficult but necessary. It may seem brutal, but without these decisions we would all perish.”* 
\- Zennran Galtir, Deathstalker 

# Divine Names
Because of his domains, those that fear Bane have given him several monikers driven by that anxiety. The most common monikers used for him include The Black Lord, Lord of Darkness, and The Dark One.  However there are a few more positive titles including He Who Acts, and The Great Decider.

# Domains
As the ultimate utilitarian, Bane’s domains focus on pragmatism and bottom line results. People lend to Bane’s power when they make difficult decisions or take on a complicated task that may have no good outcome.

**Brutality**. The primary domain is that of Brutality and includes the harsher and more physically violent aspects as well as things that are blunt, honest,  and straightforward, or difficult things that are driven out of some necessity.

**Utility**. Another aspect of Bane’s portfolio is that of utility. Bane cares about bottom line results and efficiency. While he doesn’t encourage rash and blind decision-making, he does discourage spending too much time to make a choice.

**War**. The final domain in Bane’s divine portfolio is that of warfare. In times of conflict, decisions will almost always cost lives, and delaying such decisions will cost more lives. As such, followers of Bane often find that they thrive in wartime situations because the domain of war falls under the authority of Bane.

# Dogma
Bane’s instructions to his followers are driven by a sense of necessity and utility. While they don’t advocate for unnecessary violence, this dogma does encourage those that follow Bane’s path to sometimes lean into harsh situations. 

**Be Willing to Do That Which is Needed**. The hardest decisions to make are challenging because they often have no good outcomes. But even these difficult choices must be made, and when these situations arise, it is important to be willing to do what is necessary and make a choice. 

**Done is better than Perfect**. Actions that matter will always affect some group negatively, and while it is fine to minimize those effects, delays cause more problems. Do not put off decisions too long.

**Trauma Fosters Growth**. Pressure and trauma are the best ways to get people to rise to their fullest potential. The strongest people are the ones that have survived the most harshness, loss, and difficulty. 


# Tenets 
Those that follow Bane are more likely to be exiled from larger societies than followers of other faiths, but when this happens, they consider themselves to be misunderstood. They work to foster understanding by preaching the following tenets.

**Do Not Shy Away From Difficulty**. The world is full of harsh and tough things. But we should not be afraid of these situations. When we avoid facing hard times, we let them continue instead of fixing them, and allow bad decisions to grow worse. Anytime that someone takes on a grim task, and does what is necessary, they contribute to Bane's Power.

**Life is Pain**.  Whether it’s physical or emotional, experiencing pain is a sign that people are alive and care about things. Other things clearly exist as well, but nothing reminds people that they live and breathe the ways that pain does. 

**Do Not Delay the Necessary**. Although having all relevant information to make a choice is helpful, delaying a decision accomplishes nothing. Even if the fallout of a verdict will be harsh or brutal, it should be done swiftly. Kicking the can down the road will not change any bad outcomes and will likely make them worse. Accept this, and have the strength to make the necessary call. 

# Allies of the Faith
Despite the stigma against Bane and his followers, they still often provide useful advice and fill critical positions. Because of this service, they often benefit from the alliances of the following faiths: 

### [Church of Hatred](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9zd0ft/hatred_asmodeus/)
Asmodeus compels his followers to act on their hatred and this Hatred can often provide a motivation. But when these two combine, Brutality is the one to provide the strength. Together, these faiths accomplish great and terrible things.  
### Church of Domination
Those that server Brutality often find themselves in positions of power after they demonstrate their willingness to make tough decisions. Many grow to find themselves drawn to military positions where they can be an authority whose commands are followed.
### Church of Destruction
The intersection of Brutality and Destruction is one of the biggest factors in the distance many people from this particular faith. Yet the two are often interlinked. Destruction requires that something be broken and damaged, and followers of Brutality are generally prepared to make that happen. 

# Enemies of the Faith
Although almost everyone will admit that the followers of Bane are occasionally useful, their harshness does mean they are often held at arm's length by many.

### Church of Preservation
As the God of Preservation, Pelor and his followers work to preserve life in all situations. Because part of Bane’s teachings focus on accepting harshness as a necessary part of life, he often finds himself at odds with Pelor. 

### Church of Devotion
Those that follow Devotion almost universally are working to create or pursue something that they feel drawn toward. While these two Ideals are not mutually exclusive, their followers do not overlap often. The harshness that Brutality requires doesn’t blend well with the more gentle nature of Devotion.
### Church of Endowment
Being a deity of Endowment and generosity, Ioun also finds herself in opposition to Bane and Brutality fairly often. Where Ioun advocates for helping those in need, Bane advocates accepting that harm will sometimes come to people. 

# Clergy &amp; Temples
Brutality tends to attract a certain type of people. While Bane doesn’t have any official requirements for who is or isn’t allowed to join his ranks, most that choose this path do so after having experienced harsh or difficult times that had a profound impact on them. Many of these clergy genuinely want to do well by the people around them, but also understand that sometimes there simply is no good outcome.

**Broken Ones**: The lowest ranking clergy in the Church of Brutality are called Broken Ones. Members can only be affirmed and given this rank if they have experienced some life event that has broken them in some way. There are no additional requirements, so beyond this common theme, the clergy is diverse. However, in spite of the vast array of backgrounds, the theme of similar traumas generally mean that conflicts are rare. 

**Painbearer**:  Those who have worked for long enough eventually experience enough brutality in the world around them to earn the rank of Painbearer. These clergy members take on the burden of helping others through their most painful moments.

**Deathstalker**: The most important priests of Bane that lead the church are called Deathstalkers. These individuals have survived and witnessed some of the most difficult situations there are, and many have decorated military careers, which can influence the organization or their churches. 

# Temple Designs
The temples and shrines dedicated to Brutality are often rough and minimalist. Very little decoration is used, and the structures are often made of rough stone or wood. Colors are usually dark and neutral, but occasionally they will incorporate colors from local governments or military factions that are important in the area. 

# Common Symbols &amp; Icons
The iconography that is used around this church centers around the symbol for Archeron where Bane resides. On occasion, imagery involving spiked shields or ragged swords are sometimes used, but only in a few localized areas where warfare is more common. 


# Holy Days &amp; Festivals
Generally speaking, the clergy of this faith are a more stoic group that rarely celebrates festivals. On occasion, important clergy will participate in local events, but otherwise they tend to be a bit too focused on utility to relax and have too good of a time. 	

### The Night For the Broken
Keeping with the more somber tones of this faith, the Night for the Broken is mostly a day of melancholy for those that observe it. During the evening hours, the church will host public meetings where people are invited to come speak on their own hardships and how these hardships have changed them. Whenever possible, speakers are chosen with the intent of testimonies that support the need and benefits of harshness.

# Avatars &amp; Champions
Bane rarely appears in his avatar form to anyone, including lesser deities unless he deems it necessary. Even his Champions only appear when commanded to, and they are widely regarded as bad omens when seen by mortal people.

### Avatar of Bane
Bane’s avatar form appears as that of a human man in his early 30s or so. He has dark hair and eyes,  a medium-light skin tone, and a perpetual scowl. This avatar wears a black suit of plate mail that is covered with dings and scrapes from eons of battle and carries a wicked iron greataxe on his back. He speaks very little and cuts straight to the point instead of pleasantries.

### Champion: Xulguun the Achaierai
Xulguun is an [Achaierai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaierai) - a unique species of fiend native to Archeron. They have a massive, round, song-bird-shaped body with bright orange and yellow plumage, two stumpy wings, and four long and spindly avian legs. Xulguun is particularly huge, and his serrated beak is permanently stained from being covered in centuries worth of viscera. He relishes in trauma, and when sent to deliver a message will often kill everyone around the recipient before returning to his master.

# Known Sects &amp; Cults

Despite Bane’s darker and more ruthless overtones, many mortals still find value in the Ideal of Brutality and pursue the wisdom they find within. 


### Sect: The Shields of Bane
Shield members understand that Brutality is widely useful in strengthening and shaping people. They are careful not to destroy people’s aspirations and spirits with brutality, but approach caring for others with the goal of making them stronger. They often use analogies to how smiths will hammer out metal to give it a shape and form  in their sermons, and recognize that even strong metals will break under relentless hammering.


**Optional Rule: Trial by Fire.** The Painbearers and Deathstalkers that belong to this sect have experienced enough harshness and trauma to become accustomed to it. Painbearers are considered resistant to non-magical damage, and ignore damage from hits that cause 5 points of damage or less. Deathstalkers are resistant to non-magical damage, are resistant to one type of magical damage they have been exposed to, and ignore damage from hits that deal 10 points of damage or less. 



### Sect: Blades of Brutality
Members of the Blades also recognize how harshness and brutal conditions can strengthen people, but they take this much farther than their brothers and sisters of the Shields. The people in this sect intentionally cause trauma in an attempt to push others forward in life. While there is a practical aspect to keeping a low profile, this sect is known to raze villages in an effort to find the strongest survivors to recruit to their cause. 

**Optional Rule: Relentless Vigor**. Clergy of this sect are so used to existing in harsh and violent conditions that it’s almost a natural state for them. Painbearers that belong to this group regain 10 hitpoints at the start of each of their turns, and a Deathstalker regains 20 hitpoints at the start of each one of their turns.

I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but I find the implementation of petrifying gaze in 5e pretty underwhelming. It is especially disappointing because it is the key ability of two iconic D&amp;D creatures: the medusa and the basilisk. First of all, I am sympathetic to the design choices that the designers of 5e made with respect these creatures. After all, there is a good reason that save-or-die mechanics have been largely phased out over the history of the game. However, I think there is room for improvement that makes encounters with these creatures more tactical and choice-laden. Let's take a look at the rules as written below.

***Petrifying Gaze****: If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12* [*Constitution*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Using%20Each%20Ability#h-Constitution) *saving throw if the basilisk isn't* [*Incapacitated*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#h-Incapacitated)*. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is* [*Restrained*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#h-Restrained)*. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is* [*Petrified*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#h-Petrified) *until freed by the* [*Greater Restoration*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Greater%20Restoration#h-Greater%20Restoration) *spell or other magic.*  
 *A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.*

As you may have noticed, there is technically a choice involved here: you can keep your eyes open and risk turning to stone or keep your eyes averted to completely avoid the risk. But, for most players this isn't really a choice at all. Why would anyone risk petrifaction when there is such a simple way to circumvent it?  The resulting fight is one in which all PC attacks are made at disadvantage (because the characters can't ""see"" the basilisk), and thus combat devolves into a boring slog-fest. 

The primary objective of my design is to inject some choice and tactics back into the equation. The following module is inspired by the optional facing rules in the DMG (pg. 252), and also makes use of the spell templates on pg. 204 of the PHB. There is no need for PCs to abide by the facing rules, only the basilisk or medusa. If you aren't already using the facing rules, I would also ignore the rules about shields and attacking creatures from behind. You just need to be aware of which direction the basilisk or medusa is facing, and thus which squares are threatened by its petrifying gaze.

**The new rules are as follows:**

· **Petrifying Gaze**: The basilisk emits a zone of petrifaction in a 15 ft cone directly in front of it. Any creature that enters the zone on its turn or ends its turn there must make a DC 12 [Constitution](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Using%20Each%20Ability#h-Constitution) saving throw if the basilisk isn't [Incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#h-Incapacitated). Closing or averting one's eyes does not negate or prevent this effect; although, it is blocked by physical barriers. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [Restrained](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#h-Restrained). It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [Petrified](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#h-Petrified) until freed by the [Greater Restoration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Greater%20Restoration#h-Greater%20Restoration) spell or other magic.

· The basilisk may change the direction it is facing at the end of its move. In response to another creature's movement, the basilisk may use its reaction to change its facing by 45 degrees.

So there you have it. The new rules are pretty simple, but make for a fun encounter of out-maneuvering the basilisk. To make things more interesting  you could add a second basilisk, forcing players to avoid two shifting harmful zones. I also recommend including obstacles that the characters can hide behind to protect themselves from the effect. As a final thought, you could use these rules to alter other similarly written gaze attacks, such as the umber hulk's confusing gaze or the scare crow's terrifying glare.

Have fun! ",1,Rethinking Petrifying Gaze: Alternate Rules
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,48,"# Preface

I have absolutely no idea how to format this, so bear with me, I've had a couple people ask for some more information on a specific session I ran. Let me know if this needs editing, or any clarifying questions in the comments!

# Premise

For some backstory, in addition to a session 0 individually with each PC, I had a session 0.5, in this session it consisted of a 'Main character' (one specific PC) and X amount of minor characters (other players from the campaign playing side characters from this characters backstory) This accomplished a few things, it allowed us to get in the right frame of mind for the campaign, allowed the characters to interact with the main PC and get some meta knowledge about them (I've found this is a huge help to getting newer players to roleplay during the actual campaign since they have a bit of knowledge about the character) and lastly since we ran this sequentially (the first PC to have their character together we ran before anyone else had anything solidified) it allowed me to provide my other players with pre-made characters to try out other classes and roleplay scenarios.

The biggest draw of these sessions for myself as a DM was to practice and try some scenarios that I've always wanted to run that wouldn't quite work during a regular campaign or regular session. Specifically for this one, I needed the help of the other 3 players at the table to help weave the narrative.

# Highlevel Info

The character has come under the spell of a swamp hag that casts advanced dream magic and feeds off the life force of her victims. Attempting to keep them in a sleep state so she can feed off of them for as long as possible. She resides in the flooded remains of Mirehaven, living in the tavern, she keeps the captives in the old church as she cannot stand to stay there overly long, and the other buildings are in such disrepair that they cannot safely hold her meals. She crafts Mirehaven as it once stood for each dreamer, using past memories to populate comrades to help them stay in the dream.

# Setup

The main character awakes to find themselves inside the small village of Mirehaven, nestled on the outskirts of a forest this village houses about 50-80 people. The village can have any number of places for whichever setting or locale you put it in. For my game the town had a blacksmith of some small renown locally for making shields (main PC wanted to use a shield), a tavern, a small church, a bakery and a couple farms a few miles outside of Mirehaven, it was surrounded by a 10ft pallisade on all sides.

# Running the Session

When the character comes to, they are alone in a cozy room in the upstairs of the Swamp Lily, the small tavern/inn in town and the only two story building, outside the shuttered window if they choose to look out,they see a small village of about 10-15 buildings small and wooden, in the center of town on a small hill stands a cozy church, around the town is a small pallisade, outside the town appears to be thick woods, and a long rolling plains on one end.  A stocky dwarf trundles down the road carrying a box of scrap metal, in the distance they see a dark purple sky, slowly moving towards them over the plains, a bad storm is coming. Heading downstairs in the tavern they are greeted by their party (characters from their past, session 0, pre-rolled by you and handed to characters) \[You'll want to put a good amount of effort and pre-planning into the very first interactive scene right here\]

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Heading down the stairs your met with an aromatic smell of bacon as you hear it crackling away on the stove that just creeps into view, a small kitchen just off to the side as a warm face beams up at you and offers a quick smile

&amp;#x200B;

\[Have the side characters engage the main PC right away here\]

\&gt; Morning lad, took quite a spill last night and we had to carry yer arse up the stairs! I knew you said you never drank, but that was quite somethin' 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Torvald, leave him alone, he's up now so we can get some food together then see if anyone around town needs a hand, we don't want to be on the road when this storm hits

# Running the Side Characters

The side characters are just figments of a dream spell, pulled from their memories and trying to keep the character in town for as long as possible. You want to give them an opening dialogue to start each day, as well as emotional reactions to the PC getting stubborn (I had one get angry, one get sympathetic, and one insist that his brain was addled from the fall the night previous) all of them should reference memories or past events with the main character to appeal to them to stay and listen to them, just one more night.

# The Storm

The storm is dynamic, reacting directly to actions the character takes trying to leave the town. The more they try to leave, the closer they get to leaving, the closer and more intense the storm gets. Almost everyone in the town is friendly, and entirely unsure as to why the PC wants to leave, even going so far as to have the village elder or the tavern keeper offer to house them overnight for free. There's a gate in the pallisade, with a guard that has orders to not let anyone out with the approaching storm. (if the PC gets to the gate, the storm should be pelting down rain, cracking lightning constantly, and wind threatening to knock eaves off).

# Sleeping

If the PC goes to sleep and stays the night, you have two options - Reset the day which thematically doesn't make much sense, but can hurry along the session. Or play out the next day, without resetting (This one works because it would explain how other dreamers are 'stuck' here. They have bought into the life of staying in this picturesque village, anything they want appears and is provided for them, as long as they stay inside the town.

# Leaving Town

There is only one gate that exits the town, at the start of the day the gate is open with a single guard present, looking quite bored, but also quite able to handle any minor threats. If the PC approaches the gate, he begins closing it up as the storm gets worse. If the PC sets foot outside of town, the second they do, begin reading the description of the cozy room in the Swamp Lily again. Everything they have done has reset, no other characters remember anything. Have the side PC's try to stick as close to the script as possible, citing the same reasons and doubling down on their one-dimensional trait you gave them earlier. If they try to leave, the gate has now moved and is on another side of the town, everyone says it's always been there. The next iteration does not have a gate at all, no one finds this odd. Everything in this town moves places to be more accessible, closer, make them more likely to stay EXCEPT the church.

# The Way Out

The church stands in the center of town and is on the highest hill. If the characters try to enter it, they are asked to stop by the local folk, and even their side characters ('don't go in there, it's unsafe', 'we haven't finished renovating it yet' 'there's an infestation'). Entering the church (prying off the boarded up windows or doors) reveals a strangely abandoned and disparate place, run down and smelling of murky stagnant water. If they fall through the decaying floor into the basement, or enter the basement. (Asking anyone at all about the church basement they are met with confusion, no other characters can see the basement and agree the church has never had one). Inside the basement is a tiny globe showing the village from a birds-eye view. Smashing the globe breaks the dreamer out.

# Waking Up

They awake in the old rotting church on top of the hill in the middle of Mirehaven - now a completely overran swamp, everywhere being 2-3ft of water except for the hill the church is ontop of. When the player comes to, they spot other sleeping adventurers and another globe. Smashing the other glove wakes the other adventurers (as many as you have in your play session, conveniently with the character sheets you made up for the side characters originally, if you want to change things up abit, have the side characters swap sheets at this point and get someone new) They find their (and other adventurer/travelers gear) stashed in a corner, forgotten about. After they've got up and chatted, or if they're taking too long, have hag enter and begin combat. (Also in reality the church does not have a basement)

&amp;#x200B;

NOTES

\- This was a little difficult to prep for, but a ton of fun. The reaction of the main PC when he realised that this was his story and we were all helping facilitate was super satisfying. It does tend to lose the limelight on the other players, but my group had a lot of fun playing along and leaning into their characters trying to drive him crazy and make him stay in the village.  It's one of their favorite one-shots to this day

\- Obviously depending on how long this goes on you may need to add more hints, make it more obvious the church (or whatever you change it for) is the way out. It took 4 loops for the main PC to break out, and he was basically ignoring the side characters on the last iteration, so plan for this or make sure you talk with your players that they may get benched for a small period of time.",1,GroundHag's Day - Encounter
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,141,"This submission is supposed to be an improvement and ""remix"" of [my original post on Erra](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/aaj680/erra_tyrant_of_tyrants_executioner_of_the_gods/). I've been working and reworking on a lot of my worldbuilding aspects, and realized that Erra is one of those aspects that deserves a bit more depth. I figured I should share some of that work here.

**Name:** Erra (/‘ɛ:ra/)

**Titles:** Hanging Sword, Lord of Flies, Preserver

**Alignment:** Lawful evil

**Gender:** Male

**Domains:** Ambition, authority, punishment, rulers, vigilance *(Mechanical: Trickery, War)*

**Power level:** Anuna (minor god)

**Symbol:** Red seven-pointed star with a watchful nazar in the center

**Dogma:**

* *Conquer all un-servitude.* Audaciousness and impudence only impede the Preserver's righteous Will. Align yourself with It, and guide others to It by any means necessary.
* *All answer to fear.* Fear is our most primal motivation, and thus the most natural order. Resistance to fear is resistance to one's nature.
* *Your reputation precedes you.* Control your name in others' mouths. Word begets power.

**Tenets:**

* *Surrender your eyes, ears, and mouths to the Lord.* To be the arm of His Will is an honor to fulfill.
* *Avoid argument; only obey.* Even if your pride is pleased, waste no words on enemies.
* *Vigilance is salvation.* Watch evermore, for yourself and your Lord.

**Allies of the faith:**

* No god publicly claims responsibility for **Ashur**, the egotistical and petulant god-king of his own northern kingdom, also called Ashur. Some say he is the son of Erra himself, and others that he is one of the Sebitti. No matter the answer, many observers can’t help but notice the undue power and cruelty of this god, almost as if Erra were guiding and protecting him from the shadows.
* However, Errian leaders are slightly less secretive about their association with the cult of **Nirah**, the serpentine god of the “aggressive protection” of territory. Erra and Nirah have a tense respect for each other’s ambition. Often it is Erra who protects Nirahite yuan-ti infiltrators, and likewise Nirah weakens the defenses of Erra’s enemies. However, both privately suspect, but never outright state, that each have double agents within their ranks.
* The naïve would be surprised to see the benevolent house spirit **Bel** on this list. Affectionately referred to as the “little prince,” Bel is not a god in his own right and does not have any apparent priesthood or  followers. He does, however, have many admirers, who petition him for protection against disease, such as those sent by Erra. Many keep small Bel figurines on their highest shelves, unwittingly allowing the gaze of Erra to infiltrate their homes.

**Enemies of the faith:**

* The creation and continued existence of the cult of Erra is one of the greatest embarrassments of **Marduk**. The cult of Erra was originally an order among the Mardukites before violently splitting off into its own faith. Though the order of Marduk vehemently rebukes the cult of Erra, there are nonetheless many theorists who suspect Errian agents within Mardukite ranks. Although Marduk and Erra are avowed enemies, Erra is happy to let these rumors circulate to strike fear into the hearts of mortals who “learn too much.”
* Erra’s hatred of **Geshtinanna** is one leftover of his Mardukite past. He resents her not so much for her priests’ interventions, but for what she represents to many of her followers: escape from the law, subversion of authority, quiet un-servitude. Finding and destroying anything to do with Geshtinanna is one of the obsessions of states under Errian control. Geshtinanna, desiring her own annihilation, barely objects.
* Another target of Erra’s frustrations is the god and former king **Gilgamesh**, the first aasimar. To Erra, Gilgamesh represents the most warped applications and beliefs of un-servitude and justice. Gilgamesh’s ethos changed from cruel punishment to gentle mercy in godhood, something Erra cannot abide. Furthermore, Gilgamesh is the patron of kind rulers, impudent fools who betray the natural state of fear. But Erra does not pursue Gilgamesh, instead ever-scheming, waiting for the precise moment to strike.

**Clergy and temples:**

At the height of Erra’s power, clergy and temples displayed their faith outwardly, and their symbols were treated with genuine reverence. Erra’s temples were simple, brutalist pyramid structures; each was topped by an all-seeing eye. Where these pyramids did not yet exist, Erra’s statues enjoyed offerings of metals, gems, wine, and incense at their small shrines in Marduk’s temples. Individual shrines dedicated to Erra could also be found in the chambers of the political elite. The watchful seven-pointed star was respected as the emblem of investigators and police. Clergy’s clothing resembled ancient soldiers’ ceremonial uniforms. Their color (brown, red, or black) and intricately designed armbands designated a priest’s role and rank. Brown-clad priests were the lowest rank and numerous, though their role in carrying out Erra’s orders was no less significant. Priests in black were the highest rank and could often be seen in places of honor alongside politicians at coronations and other government celebrations. The ones in red could be of any station in between, though the higher-ranked ones would, at some point, be branded with the symbol of an eye on their foreheads (if they did not have an eye there already).

Today, virtually no priest, temple, or worshiper outwardly identifies themselves as Errian. Followers and priests, driven into secrecy, identify each other via secret passwords, codes, and handshakes. The branded priests of Erra were driven especially far underground, and the status and location of many of them are still unknown. Erra’s statues were eliminated from Marduk’s temples after his notorious coup, and the original temples have been destroyed or allowed to fall into disrepair. Some shrines haunt the catacombs of cities and castles; rituals, some of them quite bloody, may still take place there. However, Erra’s followers find other ways to pay tribute to their god: many grand architectural plans, spanning palaces, cities, or even countries, are the culmination of centuries of scheming and cooperation between Errian leaders. Their arcane symbolism is only apparent to the most perceptive.

**Holidays and festivals:**

In places where Erra was openly venerated, his priests had remarkable influence over political holidays, such as coronations and elections. Politicians of all types attempted to curry their favor; an endorsement by Erra carried divine weight. When the Errians’ choice won out (as they almost always did), those same priests would then grant blessings of safety, loyalty, and clear judgement to rulers and ruled alike. Some states continued to be relatively open about their worship of Erra until international pressure forced them to cut ties.

Now, no Errian holidays are celebrated publicly. The largest gatherings are clandestine masquerades permitted only to certain high-ranking Errians and their closest pawns. They are carefully choreographed rituals of blood sacrifice and other perverse things. After political holidays, some particularly bothersome perpetrators of un-servitude are curiously found mutilated and drained of blood. Such criminal cases are quickly closed, but this fails to quell rumors and fear among the people.

**Champions and avatars:**

The **Sebitti** are a council of seven lords, hand-picked by Erra himself for their brutality and cunning and to direct other mortal agents. Bound in secrecy, little is known about the details of their activities or identities. Many attempts have been made to identify the Sebitti among mortal rulers, but none of the Sebitti ever truly reveal themselves to the world, if they have been part of the world at large at all. Each are allotted segments of land to conquer and control in Erra’s name. However, he may deliberately play the Sebitti against each other, encouraging them to struggle for power amongst themselves in order to compete for his favor. At least one may also be an aasimar, possibly vying to topple Erra himself.

**Known sects and cults:**

A handful of Erra’s worshippers are **diviners** from all stripes of life, and not all of them are necessarily evil. Generally speaking, they admire Erra - obviously in secret - for his vigilance and pray to him for clear vision and the abolition of obstacles in their work. Some of them, consensually or not, have given up their eyes and ears to Erra - figuratively and/or literally - in exchange for his insight.

Not all of Erra’s venerators are members of some grand conspiracy theory. In fact, Erra’s name most commonly appears on **prophylactic amulets** and in common sayings to ward off disaster, especially disease. On the eve of disasters, Errian priests may quietly engage with the most loyal venerators in the trade of medicine, though their “preventative cures” may do more to diffuse disease to others than truly stop it. This does not deter states from going to great measures to pursue even ordinary citizens for having his image in their homes, often leaving those of higher-ups untouched. And wherever the law is riddled with paranoia and mercilessness, Erra rules.

**The backstory:**

Erra is the lawful evil anuna (minor god) of ambition, retribution, and vigilance. He is also a descendant and ex-servant of Marduk, god of judgement and one of the Stars Who Decree.

During his mortal lifetime, Erra was an outstanding inquisitor among the Mardukites. As an intelligent and charismatic man unafraid to root out corruption inside and outside of the church hierarchy, he eventually became a well-respected leader within the order. His third eye, a mark of his divine heritage, was also said to be supernaturally perceptive; no lawbreakers escaped Erra’s gaze. As Erra approached old age, Marduk chose to reward him for his service by bestowing him with *melam*, the splendor of divinity.

Shortly after his canonization, he became a popular symbol of authority and acquired many followers, particularly among the political elite. Erra and his newfound priesthood continued to carry out investigations and punishments against lawbreakers and heretics. Chief among them were the Sebitti, seven rulers to whom other priests reported. However, the Sebitti, themselves controlled by fallible and power-hungry politicians, conspired against the order of Marduk. Under the pretense of destroying corruption among the Mardukites, Errian followers successfully overthrew key Mardukite figures and replaced them with their own followers instead. The coup, however, was short-lived; competition and infighting within the new Errian leadership itself only facilitated the regime’s collapse. Disgraced, the cult of Erra went underground, and is rumored to control many political machinations from the shadows.

Though Erra was exceptionally devout to Marduk in life, his former righteousness has crumbled to nothing. But his keenness and power of perception remain, albeit warped for crueler purposes. Erra's ability to read emotions made him a skilled inquisitor; now it makes him an adept manipulator. To the unwary, he appears as a sincere and loyal friend. Occasionally this mask slips, revealing the depths of Erra's malice. But for the most part, he happily grants his blessing to spies, executioners, monarchs, juntas, and other agents of the state.

Deep down he is a bitter paranoiac: resentful of the rejection from Those Who Decree, fearful of the intentions of the other Anunaki (minor gods), and intent on usurping their power as well. To ease his anxieties, Erra sends some devout as spies or other infiltrators to control high-ranking positions in various governments and other organizations. Sometimes he even facilitates crises himself to allow them to do so. (Plagues are a favorite method of Erra's, and many mortals associate them with his name.) He especially enjoys planting and exploiting mortals' fears, so that they may unwittingly carry out his whims.

Erra pledges allegiance, but is an inevitable traitor. He preserves the state, but may remove his hand at any time; he finds the possibility of even more violent coups and purges alluring. No amount of kingly cruelty, even that committed in his name, will completely satisfy him as long as even a flicker of rebellion exists. He will have no rest, respite, or peace until every empire and village have been crushed beneath his heel.

*“Revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets, and cannons - authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror its arms inspire in the reactionaries.”*

* Friedrich Engels",1,"Erra (the Hanging Sword, Lord of Flies, Preserver) - 2.0"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,59,794,"I'm not a betting human, but if I were I'd put a gold piece down on at least some of you rolling your eyes a bit when reading that. The phrase ""Your Weight In Gold"" is something of a cliché in fantasy literature and historical fiction, a one-off sentence meant to instill in the reader a sense of ""Oh dang, this is a lot of money"". For me, personally, that line is generally incredibly far from my thinking when at the table, having been taught over and over again that cliché is something generally to be avoided unless you can appropriately subvert it.

However, as I battle with insomnia and reflect on my session soon to come, I suddenly recalled why that cliché became a cliché in the first place: it's understandable, even to fools and simpletons. In an era where precise weight measurement is difficult at best - say, for instance, the vaguely medieval times of your D&amp;D campaign - the phrase allows you to immediately estimate how much you're being paid for your work. As such, I am going to argue three points for using this line, as well as weight for treasure value in general, in your campaign.

First, in general - or at least, from what I've seen in D&amp;D adventures and discussion so far (which is admittedly minor) - when money is handed out as payment for a guild job, a noble's adventure-hook, or as loot in a dungeon, the DMs I've seen say, ""There's ### gold pieces, ### silver pieces, and ### copper pieces"". There's plenty of good reasons for this, the most of which being that it's easy. This is the money that you rolled on the table, the money you are giving out, and the money your players will eventually count and add to their inventory sheets. However, that's not how the player characters are perceiving this haul of treasure - they see a pile, a weight rather than a number. For veteran players, this is nothing new; the ""You find 200 gold... in copper pieces"" ruse came from the very beginnings of D&amp;D, forcing itself as its own problem to solve. In some campaigns, such a challenge will be fun and interesting; in others, it's a bit of a bore. However, the point remains - even if you later give out the exact numbers, don't introduce it that way: describe seeing thousands of pounds of precious metals before you, somewhat tarnished by lying derelict in an old, musty ruin for who knows how many years, or amassing a small pile of copper, silver, and gold pieces from the pouches of your fallen foes. In terms of pure RP, value as weight helps get your players into their characters' heads.

Second, D&amp;D is one of the few instances where the exact value of the saying ""Your Weight In Gold"" can be fully calculated. Each race in the Player's Handbook, under their **Size** subsection, has the general height and weight of its members. Players can then ballpark their weight or roll it on the *Random Height and Weight* table on page 121 of the PHB. I have been at a few tables where his value is ignored, because it's one more thing to fill out and when's it going to come into play, ***really***. However, not only does determining this value make traps like pressure plates more interesting, you can also use it to add verisimilitude to your world. When your players are ready for the big quest for the powerful ruler, who finally has the massive coffers to back up the claim that they will pay ""Your Weight In Gold"", you can immediately follow through. It's not even a particularly difficult calculation; page 143 of the PHB states that, ""A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound"". Okay everyone, what are your weights? Tiranox, let's start with you - you're a dragonborn, right, so you're around 250 pounds; what did you roll? 258? Okay then. 258 x 50 = **12,900** gold pieces worth of gold. Sure, you could have just said that number in the first place, or have just said 'You'll all get 10,000 gold pieces for this job', but having your players go through all the work to come out to a personalized payment (which is still 'fair' technically) does exactly what the cliché is intended to do: make you say ""Oh dang, that's a lot of money"".

Third, it's an opportunity to flesh out your players' characters and the world around them. In that prior example, I used a Dragonborn, one of the heaviest races available to your players. However, Dragonborn exist in the same world Gnomes, Goblins, Pixies, and all manner of small and light creatures. For the average gnome (40 lbs), that same ""Your Weight In Gold"" payment would only be **2,000** gold pieces - less than 1/6th the pay of the Dragonborn's. This leads to instant drama - sure, your Gnome Rogue is as important a part of the team as the Dragonborn, but this 'fair' payment method is inherently unfair. So... what does the party do? Does the Dragonborn agree to split part of it's extra gold with the rest to make sure everyone's looked after? Does the Gnome begin to harbor jealousy, perhaps thieving extra magic items and not telling? *Be warned, greed is a factor that has killed many a game, so be very careful with how you implement this with your players.* However, this doesn't stop at the party: if this phrase is as cliché in your world as it is in ours, cultures are going to start catching on and interpreting it for their own ends. Perhaps a desperate Human monarch uses it as a way of saying 'lets work out the details later, but it's a lot, I promise'; perhaps there are many a warning in Halfling slums never to take a job if the price is ""Your Weight In Gold"", because it's almost guaranteed to be hard work for little pay; or perhaps the Dwarves have mastered the art of giving ""Your Weight In Gold"" to the small folk and static prices to the large to keep their coffers full. Asking who uses this phrase and why inherently fleshes out your world in a way that simply using direct price calculations does not.

Anyway, that's my spiel done, advocating for breaking a cardinal rule of writing to help flesh out your campaign. It's quite possible this is something that has been covered before in some other third party material, and it's quite possible that this is some crazed foolishness brought about by lack of sleep; but maybe it's interesting enough to give some DM out there an idea to make something cool. I'm sure you'll let me know.",1,"""Your Weight In Gold"""
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,34,492,"So I never really liked lycanthropy in 5e. It didn't really make much sense to me, if it's cured with a 3rd level spell, how are there still lycanthropes around? I'm also not a fan of the fact that it's universally a bad thing to become a werewolf and I don't like mechanics that make players lose control of their characters. My current game has a story arc set in a land where one in three people are werewolves and most of them have mastered the condition and are able to control it. I knew there would be a chance of my players getting bit, so I drew up some quick home brew rules to reflect how I'd like lycanthropy to work in my world. Sure enough, one of my players has been infected, so I've gone to the trouble of typing the whole thing up and making it official. The idea was to have lycanthropy be something that was life changing while not being life ending, to present opportunities for struggles and drama and character growth and introspection without derailing a game.

I plan to have a one on one session with my infected player this week to go through their first transformation and drop some lore and rules on them. We run a very heavy RP game with a lot of emphasis on character and world interraction so it's not something I want to breeze through with a few dice rolls.

Anyway, here's the first edit of the rules, fair warning they haven't been tested yet but I think I've got everything covered. Sorry for the long post, you can find the [google docs version here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n8W3DYmn6C03t0Ggq5ft_W33VD29LnPx1kU4H2ALuaA/edit)

This version of Lycanthropy seeks to make the curse more interesting and require more than a simple third level spell to remove. I wanted lycanthropy to make sense and be appropriately scary and impactful without destroying the character or taking control away from the player. I wanted a version of lycanthropy that would be a struggle, but could eventually be controlled and mastered.

# Lycanthropy in my world works as follows:

Lycanthropy may be called a curse, or thought of as such, but if it is, it’s not like other curses. Those afflicted with lycanthropy often describe it as feeling like you are sharing a portion of your soul with another entity, and entity which can influence your thoughts and feelings. Some speculate that it’s some ancient forgotten wolf god that takes up residence within. Others suggest that it is some form of disease or parasite that has grown resistant to mast magical or mundane cures. Whatever the case may be, the affliction is passed on in one of two ways. Either receiving a bite from a lycanthrope in hybrid form, or genetically through the offspring of afflicted individuals.

# Legacies

If a lycanthrope has children with someone who is not afflicted, there is a one in four chance that the offspring will inherit lycanthropy. If both parents are afflicted, it becomes a three in four chance. It is believed that drinking Moon Tea before attempting conception can repress the affliction and increase the odds that the offspring will not inherit it, but this theory lacks proper testing and documentation. Inherited lycanthropy emerges around puberty and is usually more easily mastered as the afflicted individual has had years to prepare. Those who have inherited their lycanthropy are usually referred to as ‘Legacy Werewolves’, or ‘Legacies’.

Because Legacies have many of the the same stats as the default werewolf in the MM, I have not made rules for a PC to be a Legacy as I feel the damage immunities are too OP for a player character. Legacies in my world exist as NPCs only, and can be a good way to provide a mentor for a player character undergoing the transformation and attempting to master the affliction.

# First Generation

When bitten by a werewolf or other lycanthrope the victim must succeed on a DC12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the DM rolls 1D6. On a 1-2, the character contracts lycanthropy. On a 3-6 the character is infected with Sewer Plague (which can be found on pg 257 of the DMG). A DC15 Medicine check can determine if a bite has resulted in the disease or lycanthropy. Anyone who has mastered their own lycanthropy is also able to smell the infection in a fresh bite wound.

Those who are infected by a bite will experience their first transformation on the next full moon. How they handle that first transformation will determine how well they are able to control the affliction at first.

Those who are bitten will find their condition harder to manage and more often lose control. The horror stories of werewolves usually involve a first generation werewolf rather than a Legacy however through dedication, meditation and understanding it is possible even for a first generation lycanthrope to assume a measure of control, though they will never gain the full mastery a Legacy might have.

# Ferals

Whether inherited or infected, there will be a pivotal choice when the first transformation occurs. The first thing any lycanthrope must do when the transformation begins is to make a choice. Mastery, or submission. The lure of giving in to the beast, giving in to the power, the confidence and the pure animal instinct can be a great temptation for some. When the transformation process begins, the new lycanthrope must choose whether to give in to the wolf, surrendering themselves to its control or whether they will fight to maintain control themselves and work towards mastering the beast. Those who choose to give in become wild, uncontrollable beasts. The wolf takes them completely and is able to affect them more than it otherwise would. These are known as Feral Werewolves and use the rules for werewolves in the MM.

Often Ferals will find others of their kind and form little communities far from prying eyes where they live in a primal pack ruled by bestial ways. Often they’ll have an Alpha who leads them. They’re fearful and resentful of the human world they’ve left behind, acting with aggression towards any who encroach on their territory, surviving day by day and always waiting eagerly for the next full moon. Sometimes though, Ferals will try to maintain their human lives while keeping their condition a secret.

# First Transformation

This first transformation will assume a First Generation werewolf since I have no plans to let players be a Legacy werewolf. I am handling the first transformation as a one on one session with the infected player because it will be a skill challenge wrapped up in some lore and RP and will probably take a while to get through, however you could strip it down to the basics if you want.

I’d highly recommend finding a way to have a mentor accompany the player, or at least instruct them beforehand of what will occur. Legacies are great for this as they’ve been through it and mastered it and it also doesn’t matter if they get bit.

Mastering lycanthropy is a process and with more control come more pros and less cons. Depending on the style of game you’re running and how quickly you want your player to have access to some of the higher end features you can tweak how long the process of mastering it will take.

Under the first full moon after becoming infected, the character will experience a thrill of emotion, a rush of eagerness, fear, anger, exhilaration, rage and power. The beast within is stirring and will soon emerge. First though, it wants to weaken the resolve of the character, it will be a battle for dominance and there can only be one Alpha. Early in the night the process will begin and the character must choose to submit or fight. If they submit all this is for naught because that’s what the MM werewolf is for. If however they wish to fight, read on.

Lycanthropy affects the Mind, Body and Soul and will try to dominate each of these domains. There will be three saving throws in each for a total of nine. If the initial bite was treated with a poultice of Wolfsbane within 24 hours, the character can add +1 to all their saving throws as the treatment helps repress the wolfs influence to a small degree.

# Mind

Each attack against the mind requires a Wisdom saving throw. If a character drinks Moon Tea (a concoction brewed from exact amounts of Wolfsbane, Belladonna and Shimerleaf) they may choose one of their three Mind Saves to reroll and choose the higher of the two results. The decision to reroll must be made after the roll and before the next one. Knowledge of Moon Tea will usually be imparted by a mentor who will be able to instruct in it’s preparation or the information could be discovered as a result of research or a Medicine check.

The beast within preys on fear, recalling memories of the character when they have been afraid and promising the comfort and security that can be offered by the wolf.

The beast within glories in vengeance, bringing to mind those who have wronged the character .

The beast within promises power and those who lust for power will feel the influence, fear and respect that the wolf demands.

# Body

Each attack against the body requires a Constitution saving throw. If the character has fasted for a day before the transformation they can divert the focus of the wolf to the baser instinct to feed allowing them to choose one of their three Body Saves to reroll and choose the higher of the two results. The decision to reroll must be made after the roll and before the next one.

The beast within promises strength, rippling muscles and raw might. Characters who have been bested or overwhelmed by a superior foe might have flashbacks of those times.

The beast within promises life, an escape from death. If a character has ever been reduced to zero hit points or died they may relive that moment, knowing that the wolf could be there next time to stop it.

The beast within promises the freedom born of physical prowess. The character might experience fancies of running through the woods, leaping and climbing with ease. As with all the attacks, the beast will personalise this, perhaps emphasising speed for a slow character or the enhanced hearing and smell for a curious character.

# Soul

Each attack against the soul requires a Charisma saving throw. If the character has the support of close friends and/or family and has not been rejected or kept their condition a secret, they may choose one of their three Soul Saves to reroll and choose the higher of the two results. The decision to reroll must be made after the roll and before the next one.

The beast within preys upon the rejection of society, the stigma against werewolves. It will try to convince the character that they are alone now and that only the wolf is there for them.

The beast will prey upon anxiety and worry for the future. It will appeal to the side of a character that wants to run and hide in the woods where politics and wars don’t matter.

The beast will seed the idea that the character will be rejected by the gods. It may question their reliability if they are willing to let the character become infected. It will insist that only the wolf is worthy of worship, only the wolf can save them.

# Saving Throws

For each attack the beast makes, a saving throw must be made for a total of nine. The base DC is 12, however beating the DC by 5, 10 or 15 or by rolling a natural 20 a greater success will be had. Use the following table and keep a running tally of the score throughout. Note that it is possible for the score to drop into the negatives at this stage.

1-11 -1

12-16 +1

17-21 +2

22-26 +3

27+ +4

Nat 20 +5

By the end the character should have an overall score between -5 and 45 but will likely average somewhere between 5-20 depending on level, class and modifiers. At this point, if the score is less than 1, it becomes 1. This is the number of Mastery Points that will be applied to the Mastery Progress chart to determine how much of a grasp the character has on the affliction.

# Turning

After all the saving throws, the actual transformation occurs. The werewolves first transformation will result in the base stats regardless of the progress made on the chart. The advancements made there are learned as part of the first transformation and will take effect on any future transformations. A baseline werewolf has the following traits:

The werewolf takes stat scores from the character. Their highest stat number becomes the werewolves Strength score. For example if the character has a Wisdom of 20, the werewolf will have a strength of 20. The second highest score becomes Constitution and the third highest becomes Dexterity. These stats will always scale with the character.

At baseline the Werewolves Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores are 7

**Hybrid Form:** The werewolf transforms into its hybrid form. It’s total and current hit points are the same as the character has. Aside from that the werewolf uses a separate character sheet. No proficiencies or abilities are carried across. Hybrid form has a speed of 30 ft and AC10+Dexterity+Constitution. The werewolf cannot speak in hybrid form.

**The Beast Within:** If the character drops to zero hit points, an immediate transformation will occur even if the number of transformations per long rest has already been reached. On each turn after transforming the werewolf must succeed a DC15 Wisdom save or use all of its movement and actions to attack whatever creature caused the character to drop to zero hit points. If the creature is dead or cannot be reached or pursued (eg. flying or teleported away) the werewolf will target the next closest creature instead. After one minute the werewolf reverts to it’s true form at zero hit points and begins making death saves if necessary.

**Uncontrollable Transition:** The werewolf transforms into hybrid form at the full moon only and cannot transform at will. They remain in hybrid form until dawn. While transformed, they find it hard to differentiate friend from foe. On each turn after transforming the werewolf must succeed on a DC15 Wisdom saving throw or use all of its movement and action to attack the nearest creature.

**Shapechanger (Prolonged Transformation):** Transforming into hybrid form takes 10 minutes and is very noisy. Any equipment being worn or carried is not transformed and will be torn or dropped as appropriate. If the werewolf drops to zero hitpoints it reverts to its true form.

**Exhausting Ordeal:** After reverting back to humanoid form, the lycanthrope suffers two points of exhaustion

**Attack:** The werewolf makes one attack, either with its bite or its claws

**Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +Strength to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC10 Constitution saving throw or have the chance of becoming infected with lycanthropy

**Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +Strength to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (2d4 +Strength) slashing damage.

&amp;#x200B;

# Mastery

As the character becomes more capable and confident in their new form and gains a greater understanding of the affliction, they can begin to master it. Aside from those gained during the first transformation, Mastery Points can be gained by meditation, study and practice. The character gains 1 Mastery Point for every 8 hours spent studying the condition, meditating on the influence of the wolf or spending time in wolf or hybrid form. As they gain more points, more features and traits will be unlocked as show in the table below.

&amp;#x200B;

|1||Baseline for those who choose to control their lycanthropy. You cannot go below this score. At this point a new lycanthrop needs to manage their condition to ensure they don’t put  others at risk. Measures might include locking themselves up at the full moon, or regularly drinking Moon Tea.|
|2|||

|5|**Keen Hearing and Smell:** The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell while in hybrid form.||
|6|||

|10|**Meditative Transition:** The werewolf can transform into hybrid form at will once per long rest and can revert to their normal form at will. During the full moon they must make a DC12 Wisdom saving throw or be forcibly transformed. When transformed due to a failed save they find it hard to differentiate friend from foe. On each turn after transforming the werewolf must succeed on a DC12 Wisdom saving throw or use all of its movement and action to attack the nearest creature.(This replaces Uncontrollable Transition)||
|11|**Shapechanger:** Transforming into hybrid form takes 1 minute and is mildly noisy. Any equipment being worn or carried is absorbed into the new form. If the werewolf drops to zero hitpoints it reverts to its true form. (This replaces Shapechanger: Prolonged Transformation)||
|12|**It Speaks:** The werewolf gains the ability to speak in hybrid form. It knows all the languages the character does.||
|13|**The Beast Within:** If the character drops to zero hit points, an immediate transformation will occur even if the number of transformations per long rest has already been reached. The form gains 9d8 temporary hit points. On each turn after transforming the werewolf must either attack or be attacked to maintain the transformation. After one minute or if the werewolf fails to attack or be attacked it reverts to it’s true form at zero hit points and begins making death saves if necessary.|This milestone is recognised by mentors and Legacies as the new lycanthrope managing a degree of control. Their condition still needs to be managed, but they are less likely to hurt innocents by accident.|
|14|**Taxing Ordeal:** After reverting back to humanoid form, the lycanthrope suffers one point of exhaustion (This replaces Exhausting Ordeal)||
|15|**Multiattack:** The werewolf can make two claw attacks||
|16|**Reflexive Survival:** While in hybrid form, the werewolf inherits the saving throw proficiencies of the character, using the characters proficiency bonus.  The AC of the werewolf also becomes 12+Dexterity +Constitution||
|17|**Wolf Form:** The werewolf can transform into a wolf with the stats of a wolf. This transformation always takes the same amount of time as hybrid form based on Mastery. It counts towards the number of transformations per long rest.||
|18|**Running Wild:** Speed increased to 40 ft||
|19|**Diminished Influence:** The moon has less power over the werewolf and no longer forces a transformation. Edit Meditative Transformation to reflect this change.|When a lycanthrope can resist the call of the moon they are considered to have mastered the condition enough to be safe to themselves and others. This will often be the point in lycanthropic communities when they able to take on a disciple themselves, having enough of an understanding of the affliction to guide other new lycanthropes through the process.|
|20|**Presence of Mind:** Pick one ability score from the character (either Intelligence, Charisma or Wisdom). This score will be retained when transforming into Wolf or Hybrid form.||
|21|**Skinchanger:** The lycanthrope no longer suffers exhaustion after a transformation, remove Taxing Ordeal.||
|22|**Effortless Transition:** The werewolf can transform into hybrid form at will once per long rest and can revert to their normal form at will. (This replaces Meditative Transition) **Shapechanger:** Transforming into wolf or hybrid form takes 1 action and is silent. Any equipment being worn or carried is absorbed into the new form. If the werewolf drops to zero hitpoints it reverts to its true form. (This replaces the previous Shapechanger)||
|23|**Envenomed Bite:** The saving throw on the bite attack becomes a DC12||
|24|**Multiattack:** The werewolf can make three claw attacks (This replaces the previous Multiattack)||
|25|**Climb:** The werewolf can climb any surface that gives purchase to claws. It has a climb speed equal to its movement speed.||
|26|**Alpha:** Wolf form now has the stats of a Dire Wolf. The character can now also transform into a wolf once per long rest and into hybrid form once per long rest. Edit Effortless Transition to reflect this change||
|27|**Strange Familiarity:** In hybrid form, the werewolf inherits all the proficiencies of the character, using the characters proficiency bonus.||
|28|**Resilient:** Resistant to Bludgeoning, Piercing and Slashing damage from non-magical non-silvered attacks while in hybrid form||
|29|**One Self:** Hybrid form now retains the ability scores of the character for Charisma, Wisdom and Intelligence when transforming.||
|30|**Master of Forms:** The lycanthrope can transform into wolf or hybrid form at will twice per long rest.||

# Remove Curse

If a remove curse spell is attempted early on, describe the spell as sinking into the character, seeking out a curse. The spell settles around something, not quite a curse perhaps, but something wrong. It can be sensed as a mass buried within the essence of the character with long bramble-like tendrils twisting out, around and through the soul. Attempting to remove the curse like this would result in severe damage. As the Mastery progresses, the curse becomes more ordered, more in line with the soul. A remove curse spell cast at 30 Mastery Points might show the curse as a clean round mass nestled within the soul. My ruling is that when a lycanthrope has 30 Mastery points, a remove curse spell cast at 7th level can remove lycanthropy with no damage to the character.

# Moon Tea

Many lycanthropes have discovered the benefits of Moon Tea in repressing the influence of the wolf and allowing greater control. Moon Tea is brewed with very precise amounts of Wolfsbane, Belladonna and Shimmerleaf (*I made that last one up*). Whenever a lycanthrope has to make a saving throw relating to maintaining control (either due to The Beast Within or Uncontrollable Transition) they gain advantage if they have ingested Moon Tea within the past 8 hours. Moon tea is slightly toxic however and if it ingested more than once every 12 hours the character will become poisoned for 1d4 hours.

The layout for this card started as simulation of the fantastic Arcana Note's style of item cards. While I shamelessly simulated their card style, I made these from scratch in GIMP, and believe there are enough differences that I shouldn't be stepping on anyone's toes. With that out of the way, here is what they look like:

[The Devil in the Details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2uwC8j82TlaLWkydm5YSF9fQjlpd083cmdGTVZJby1iVGo4/view?usp=drivesdk)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Setup**

&amp;#x200B;

Your adventurers come into possession of an envelope, sealed with wax and marked with an address that has been badly smudged, making it mostly unreadable, apart from the name of the city. Within the envelope, they find a letter written on fine paper with the practiced, measured hand one would expect of a scribe or scholar, which discusses an arrangement between two parties that is being pushed beyond its expected bounds, and the dangers involved. It is clear that more letters will likely follow, containing vital and potentially dangerous information. Through intercepting this letter, and those that follow--or finding the sender or receiver of the letters--the party learns that a special, powerful ritual to summon and bind a Greater Devil is being researched and planned.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Details**

&amp;#x200B;

Rolling tables have been put together to give the DM ready-made ideas for how the initial letter is discovered, what city it is addressed to, what the relationship is between the sender and receiver, what the consequences are if the ritual is complete, and what Greater Devil would be summoned by the ritual. These are only suggestions, of course, and you can easily fill in those blanks with whatever best fits your game, or expand them to suit your needs. Essentially, one person is trying to summon and bind a Greater Devil to their service for some reason, and has made arrangements with someone else to do the research and send information to them on how to do it. The party can make plans to intercept the letters, allow them to continue, forge replacement letters, try to find the sender, try to find the recipient, or any number of other hijinks. If the party intercepts the letters, and doesn't allow them to reach the recipient, the sender will be notified of the failure and will simply send the letters again, so this will only delay the ritual, rather than prevent it, if that is the party's goal.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Letters**

&amp;#x200B;

The researcher sending the letters has copied the original mage's words, verbatim, into three separate letters, which they send at different times. The first letter summarizes the original mage's thoughts on the development of the summoning ritual (basically Summon Greater Demon, tweaked for Devils, and a fluffed-up Magic Circle, with some elements of Geas), along with the material components required to complete this ritual. The bottom of this description also features a seemingly random collection of letters that do not spell out anything. The second letter details the process of setting up for the ritual, and illustrates one of two Magic Circles required for the spell. The third and final letter describes and illustrates how to form the second Magic Circle, and also features a collection of seemingly random letters at the bottom. It also gives the party a glimpse into the mindset of the original author of the ritual, and suggests that they may have found The Book of Vile Darkness, or something like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ritual**

&amp;#x200B;

When combined, the letters provide all the instructions necessary to complete the spell, and the two collections of letters can be overlaid, one on top of the other, to spell out an incantation, which includes the True Name of the Devil being summoned. In the case of the pre-written letters, this incantation is ""VOCAT PER PORTAS LIGANT OCCULTA OKKYR ISUMAIMUAM."" Of course, without putting together the incantation, the ritual cannot be performed, at all. If the incantation is spoken without the Magic Circles being successfully completed, as the letters suggest, the Devil is summoned, not under control, and immediately hostile. If a player collects the necessary components and attempts the ritual, they must make a DC 25 Charisma Save, or the Devil that is summoned will not be under their control.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point or another, the adventuring party may choose to set up a camp and rest for a time in the wilderness. Inspired by *Critical Role*, this is a set of general rules I use to pass nights spent outside. A long rest is considered six hours, and three sentries take turns covering three two-hour shifts. This time can be changed based on the circumstances in your campaign, and the following information is intended only as a general guideline to make long rests more interesting. Use the following table to help guide the group as the set up a camp. Get one member of the party to make a *survival* check to help determine the quality of lodging that the party is able to find in the area. You may choose to grant the investigator advantage if the party is in possession of particularly good camping gear, such as tents, fire-starters, food, etc.

The party are assumed to understand how to properly set up camp, but if they lack the resources to do so, or they find themselves in a bad spot where they must set up camp, you can make them make additional *survival* checks to set up a suitable camp. If the camp is not suitable, make any *long rests* become *short rests*.

I've found a fun way to both hand out DM Inspiration fairly, and also get the players to roleplay a little bit more than they might on their own, all while giving you, the DM, slightly less to do for next session.

I have given my players the option to recap the previous week's session in-character, whether that be in journal form, just a stream of consciousness in their head, talking to their god/patron/totem of choice, whatever, sky's the limit. Typically it will be decided at the end of the previous session whether or not someone wanted to recap, and I'd let my players decide if one of them felt interested enough to do so. It usually ends up being the player whose character had the most traumatic, or exciting, or otherwise memorable/unique things happen to them. My players, who are decent at roleplaying, really have a chance to shine in their own unique way at the beginning of the session.

My barbarian usually speaks to his totem spirits, my bard rewrote lyrics to a song to be about the session, the sad paladin writes in his sad journal, and the Half-elf rogue writes Elven poetry. It's all good fun. And of course, when they do their recap, they get a point of DM inspiration as an incentive.

# Introduction

*The locals are scared of their local well, which is situated in the ruined courtyard of a once-stately home. After an old lady didn't come back from fetching water one evening, her grandson went to investigate. There was a yelp, and he was followed by his father. The next morning, their neighbor drew up a pale of water, only to find it red with blood. Now no one wants to go near it or the courtyard. The local guard have rope ladders they can drop down, but if something is big enough to drag people in then they need back-up.  That's where our adventurous step in...*

The courtyard is a vestige of a once grand Roman-style house, where the 70x70 garden sat within the middle. Now all that remains is the original well, a handful of the pillars, and a few weathered walls overgrown with ivy. The rest of the houses are all newer constructions that were erected around the site and use the well every day. For now, no one is willing to go near it.

# What the players don't know

The well itself is, asides from the introduction of dead bodies, otherwise absolutely fine. However a man who once lived in the area many years ago, Yinobe Griffon, has sneaked back to revel in a murder rampage in the name of the God of Murder Bhaal. His weapon of choice is a blowgun, with a dagger to finish off his paralyzed prey, however things did not go to plan. He had hoped to arrange the bodies in ""a pretty pattern"" but half-way through his macabre arrangement of the old lady he was discovered by her grandson. Paralyzing him too, he feared too much noise had been made so we threw their bodies down the well: letting the fall finish off the boy. As victim number three came round the corner, he hid himself behind the well before using a third dart to repeat his attack. Not wanting to push his luck, and with most of  his art supplies in the water, he dumped the final body and fled to his camp on the outskirts. The next night, he hopes to continue his killing spree.

# The Locals

The people living here haven't had much scandal or anything to worry about for quite some time, and are therefor very rattled by the death of three people in one night. Since the courtyard is also the oldest area, people are also very superstitious and are talking about ghosts, curses and all manner of supernatural shenanigans. The Nana Twins are especially vocal about their belief that the Earl who once lived there now haunts the well and hates everyone for trespassing.  On a successful Insight check (DC 15) a player will be able to determine that whilst some locals like the twins are quite convinced by their own stories, they are also exceptionally panicked and are looking for any kind of affirmation. Should the party feel inclined to lie to them about what has happened, their Deception checks will be at advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbor of the victims, a crotchety old man named Maurmill Griffon, thinks the family were involved in devil-worship, but is easily identified as a liar with an Insight check (DC 10) or a quick Investigation check (DC 10) of their house which shows regular worship of Lathander (or any NG deity). If the party somehow manages to search Maurmill's house, an Investigation check (DC 15) will find several journals where we obsessively spied on his neighbors and wrote petty comments about them. If pressed, he will also admit that he is lonely because his son left many years ago (Yinobe Griffon).

# The Well and courtyard

The well itself is quite pretty, with a top bar and slate-tile roofing. There is a stone boundary built around the opening and two iron rings set into the edge so a rope ladder can be attached in the case of an emergency. A History check (DC 10) will show that all of this is part of the original architecture, and the only thing that has been changed is the rope and bucket. Said bucket is currently on the floor by the well and still has some bloodied water in it. The shaft of the well is about 4 feet across and approximately 100 foot deep. Seeing down to the bottom is difficult but a character with Dark Vision or a light source they can direct down will be able to just make out the water's surface and some dark, still shapes. These shapes are the three bodies of our victims, and are easily identified if someone goes down the well (that can see) or the bodies are brought back up.

&amp;#x200B;

Nearby to the well, there is a blood stain on the grassy flagstones which can be spotted with a Perception or Investigation check (DC 15). There's not much blood, but a trickle leads back to the well itself. With a successful Survival check (DC 18) a player can determine that someone else was here who had been sat among the long grass around the sides, and that nearer to the well bodies had been dragged and someone had come and gone around the area. Among the pillars, rubble,  ivy and long grass: there are a lot of places someone could hide.

# The Bodies

The old lady's body has a single puncture wound in the chest, leaving a bloody tear in her blouse. Her expression is blank. The boy has a bloody head, suggesting blunt trauma (from hitting the sides of the well on the way down) and has a shocked expression. The grown man has no obvious wounds and a frown. A successful Medicine check (DC 15) will identify that all three bodies have puncture marks from darts, and the skin is red and swollen around those areas from a venom. A roll of 20 or more will identify that the man died from drowning and was alive when he went down the well.

# The attacker

Whilst the players are in the courtyard investigating, Yinobe will sneak back and attack the party for meddling with his work. A stat block for a Spy or Assassin should work, so long as he is a Chaotic Evil Humanoid with high Dexterity and proficiency with the Stealth skill. He wields the magic weapons 'The Pipe of Bhaal' and 'The Bhaal Ritual Rondel'. Sneaking in through one of the gaps in the wall, he will stealthily approach until he is within range of his blowpipe, and shoot his first dart as soon as everyone looks suitably distracted or are about to leave.

If Yinobe is outnumbered in melee combat, or the PCs attempt to get help or leave, he will change strategy. Fleeing toward his father's house, he will kill his father and attempt to barricade himself inside his house: sniping from the windows and fighting to the death if cornered inside. He cannot be negotiated with, but he may admit that his father was a very cruel man who ""made me who I am today"".

# The Pipe &amp; Rondel

**The Pipe of Bhaal** is a +1 Blowgun made from a very dark wood and decorated with tiny red stones around the mouth piece. Any dart shot from it whilst in dim light or darkness makes a living target it hits take a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save they are paralyzed until the end of the attacker's next turn. If they make the save by 5 or less, they are poisoned until the end of the attacker's next turn instead. A target who has been paralyzed before by this effect during this current combat has advantage on the saving throw.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bhaal Ritual Rondel** is a long thin +1 Dagger designed purely for stabbing. The handle is made from a matching dark wood to the pipe and a ring of small red stones adorns the pommel. If it is used to reduce a living creature to zero hit points, the attacker may immediately move an additional 10 feet and any opportunity attacks against them are at disadvantage.

# Conclusion

With Yinobe taken care of, the local guard will thank the players and pay them with a small amount of gold (they are thankful but not well funded.) They may also ask the players to investigate Bhaal worship in the neighboring area and will offer to pay for any information they might find.

If Griffon survives and learns that the killer was his son, he will also pay the party some money, and will concede that he ""didn't treat that troubled boy well"".  


(EDIT: Spelling mistakes)",1,Mystery at the Well (A misleading side quest)
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,41,"Last night I sat down and made the decision to really hammer down my setting's gods, religions, and faith practices. What I came up with isn't complete, but it *is* a sight better than just a list of names and portfolios, which is what I'm so often relegated to when brainstorming gods on the fly. I should say that these deities have been revised, inserted into and yanked out of world conflicts, and polished quite a bit to get them where they are. 

The gods take a significant amount of inspiration from Greek mythology, with gods having human-like emotional spectrum and a certain amount of fallibility that lends them to creative storytelling. 

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to a little side piece on gods in gaming: I believe wholeheartedly that gods should be divorced from the alignment system. My reasons are the following.

* It's too easy for a character playing a paladin, cleric, of faith-based character to simply look at deity alignments, choose one that mirrors their own, and then jump ass-first into that character without considering the god as a character in the world. That is to say, what if your paladin values honesty and the lawful neutral deity she's chosen to follow is a renowned patron of litigators and legal loopholes? You might argue that such a god wouldn't be lawful neutral, but this is my example and in my campaign world I can do whatever I want. Nevertheless, that paladin would be ill-served by adhering to the god simply because of an alignment chart that is predicated on cosmic planar laws. That leads me to my second point...
* The alignment system is founded on the idea that the world you're playing in is part of a diverse array of cosmic planes which each have some predilection to chaos, law, evil, good, or an absence or mixture of those things. Your campaign world doesn't have to follow that model, so alignment can easily be a moot point.
* Finally, gods should be interesting individuals with grand stories to their name. The greatest stories ever told are the ones that involve them. We don't have to look any farther than pop culture to know that. But the gods in those stories (Kratos, Thor, Wonder Woman) are only interesting because of their fallible, human-like aspects. Simply calling the god of knowledge a bookworm true neutral deity with no care for relationships can work. But if there is a why embedded in there -- why is he a loner? why does he trust so slowly? why does he prefer automatons to others like him? where did he get that scar? -- and the alignment is removed from the equation, suddenly we have creative liberty to design the god however we want. However you want. 
* Actually finally, alignment isn't all bad and I use it to constrain myself when I want to subvert tropes, limit the impact a character or deity can have in a situation or narrative, and produce the familiar to make my players feel at ease when I want them to feel at ease. Nothing is more refreshing after a litany of trope-bending characters than one who meets exactly our expectations and then slowly shifts them over time. I still don't slap an alignment on my gods; instead I explore them in a framework provided by an alignment.

That turned into a long aside rather than the short one I thought it would be. Eh.

For your viewing pleasure, I offer you the Niovit. These are a pantheon of gods who did not create the world, but who created the living creatures that inhabit it. They are family, as befitting a pantheon which stakes itself in mortalkind's continued survival. And they are mythological deities, with tales and fables attributed to them to explain natural phenomena. The world is entering a new age, and as such gods like these help people understand their environment and model their lives. Most mortals will venerate at least one or two of the gods, though not all find them worthy of worship.

The faiths of the Niovit are communal forms of worship. They bring people together, joining them through commonalities and the need for support, and uplift each other. Individuals may pray alone, meditate, or consider the miracles of the gods in solitude, but they worship by engaging the community in their revelations. Chapels and large, physical edifices of worship are erected to the Gods of Society, the Church of the Three Mothers, and Rophion, though they hardly resemble each other in construction and purpose. Other gods have shrines, holy sites, and forums where worshipers come together to pray together, eat together, and discuss among themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Church of the Three Mothers** builds holy houses where the sick, poor, lonely, and afraid congregate. These houses are usually existing buildings repurposed for the means of the Church, or are humble buildings built with donated funds and time from citizens. They resemble soup kitchens and homeless shelters, but the blessing of the Three Mothers prevents disease from spreading in their confines, and punishes those who would siege the houses themselves.

**The Gods of Society** have large, elaborate, beautiful stone and glass chapels built where idols to the three deities of civilization are arranged for the worship of large congregations. These chapels are modeled after the mosques of the half-orcs, who popularized the buildings before the Long War through mission work. In Ceilia, the chapels are less opulent and more utilitarian, resembling a single large building with numerous halls and rooms where the functions of the chapel are housed. Often, Ceilian chapels are circular and feature a promenade which encircles them, where trade and debate can be waged.

**The churches of Rophion** are less frequently a singular building and more often look like large, sprawling villas crossed with academic campuses. They are low to the ground, have numerous distinct buildings, and feature long outdoor walkways paved with stone and crisscrossing beautiful gardens and lawns. Oftentimes, the buildings have gardens on their roofs where people gather for lunch and talk about current affairs. Rophion's churches almost always have a chamber of the Holy Niovit, a small shrine built to glorify all of the gods of the pantheon, where worshippers of other deities may come and pay their respects. These chambers are dimly lit, quiet, and usually have one or two priests who attend the devotees by providing holy texts, incense, holy water, and garb appropriate to mediation and prayer. Rophion's churches are nearly always the location of a bath house and steam room, allowing travelers and citizens alike the luxury of cleanliness.

The gods are as follows.

* Maonos, god of dragons, is one of the most powerful deities. He is worshipped by the various intelligent dragons which reside on Ordain, as well as dragonborn and other sentient folk who rightfully fear and respect the mighty and terrible dragons. He has a son, the Wyvern King, who is the demigod ruler of the nation of Odetsa in Ahlvator. Maonos is said to have built the kingdom of heaven himself, using all the wealth of that realm to create a resplendent, shining city where all the gods now reside. It is his daughter, Tiamat, who led the first uprising against the city of heaven in what is known as the First War. Many angels followed her, including one who would come to be known as the Adversary of Igdione.
* The goddess of song and travel, Palanthia, is one of three gods known as the Gods of Society. The other two, Gideon and Talon, are venerated alongside her in the civilized parts of the world. They are the patron gods of the Ceilian empire, and are among the only gods to require churches or other edifices constructed in their name (other gods usually ask that worshippers construct shrines in their homes or in the wilderness). Gideon is the god of magic, while Talon is the god of light, law, and knowledge.
* Igdione is the mother of the gods, including Maonos and the Gods of Society. She is the goddess of stars, and as such she is said to be all-seeing and all-knowing. Her eldest sons are the gods of the sun and the moons, and because of this she is viewed as a goddess of fertility. She is worshipped alongside her daughters Heqdea and Palanthia in a faith known as the Church of the Three Mothers. Members of this faith come from all walks, seeking healing, wisdom, alms, and sometimes just a place to lay their head at night. The Three Mothers faith only allows women into the clergy, and commands numerous members to quest in the aid of families, mothers, and children who cannot help or protect themselves. Clerics of the faith are called Daughters.
* Phoberar and Akramhu are the god of the moons and sun, respectively. Phoberar is also venerated as the sky god, bringing rain, health, and seasons to the people of Ordain. Akramhu is known as the fertility god, as well as the god of protection and forethought. They are twins, and are often depicted fighting the Adversary of Igdione while their mother shelters the mortals of Ordain. Phoberar is a somewhat aloof god, who frequently muses over philosophy and art, while Akramhu is the passionate brother, loving and quarreling in equal measure.
* Rophion is the god of the earth, crafts, rivers, and music, and is the patron of cities and towns across Ordain. People revere him even if they don't worship him, as he takes comfort from trade, craftsmanship, festivals, dance, and a strong family. He is also the god of brewing, and brewers, vintners, and distillers usually offer the first barrel or keg of a batch to him out of respect, blessing it and pouring the first cup into a specially prepared plot of earth. Some longtime brewers bury their loved ones in these plots, which more often than not grow bounteous fruit trees -- even if none were planted there.
* Heqdea is Igdione's eldest daughter and firstborn, and she is the goddess of fate, sleep, darkness, and forests, and is venerated by elves the world over. She was the first being to set foot on Ordain, and she is said to have walked every step of the land at least three times before she was sure of the world's safety. She is a watchful, silent guardian, and owls are her favored animal. She sees wildlife, especially the creatures of the forest, as kin, and her most devout are vegetarian, taking no sustenance from the flesh or products of animals of any kind. She was also the first being to give birth after Igdione, and she bore Acros, the god of paths, luck, and animals. Her son is the exact opposite of her pensive nature, and he fills the halls of heaven with dance, levity, and wit, and enjoys debating his elder aunts and uncles. He is not allowed to drink, however, as the one time he did he broke into Phoberar's vault of the sky and -- filled with uncharacteristic malice -- dumped a cup of wine on a model of one of the moons. Since then, both drink and the moon have driven men to madness, though each in their own way.
* Curphorian is Igdione's youngest son, and he is viewed with suspicion and distrust at best by his siblings. He is the god of war, storms, death, and the oceans, and was instrumental in defeating the Adversary in the early days of the world. He has sired sons among the world since the first days, and each of them has grown to great strength and influence. His siblings do not hate him, they simply see his ways of war and destruction as a necessary evil for the world to continue on its course.

The following are 2nd generation gods, and are more likely to be patron deities to cults or smaller religious systems.

* Atrix is the daughter of Rophion, and is the goddess of honesty, peace, and justice. She is the patron god of dwarves, and worked with her father to gift them with long life and memory so that they might never forget the lessons of their history, even after the history itself has faded. She is close to her grandmother, and the two are alike in their omnipotent vision of the world. Atrix is present at the swearing of oaths, ceremonies, and death, signing the final compact that puts a soul to rest. Ghosts are said to be those Atrix forgets or punishes, forcing them to live out a past evil until they can be absolved.
* Mortar, son of Akramhu, is the god of miracles, victory, and zeal. He is his father's passion incarnate, and he is one of the only gods who finds the company of Curphorian enjoyable. Together, the two have led many an army to glory, and together they have engineered the downfall of kingdoms and empires. Paladins of all kinds pray to Mortar for the conviction and strength to do right by their oaths and charges, and find that the god rewards those who take risks and punish the apathy of evil.
* Oziphan, god of reason and language, is the son of Rophion. He is the close confidant of his sister Atrix and of Phoberar, his uncle. Together, the three of them have stoked the flames of philosophy and learning among mortals, giving them the desire to learn and wonder at the mysteries of the world and worlds beyond. Half-orcs view Oziphan as their patron, though their relationship with him is less cozy than that of Atrix her people. Instead, they see Oziphan as the greatest teacher and thinker of all, and strive to emulate his intellectual ways.
* Hibelia, the daughter of Heqdea, is the goddess of thresholds. She guards every transitory space, be it the eaves beneath a home or the veil of life and death. She is invoked by name at the beginning of a journey and thanked when home at last. She is one of the most sworn-by gods, and many are fond of the phrase, ""By Hibelia's keys…"" in reference to her fabled ring of keys which unlock the gates between realms. She is said to be the only one among the gods who knows how to unlock the door between heaven and hell, and she presides over the march of souls that are shepherded through by the fey psychopomps, the faeries.
* Esparath, the daughter of Palanthia, is the goddess of martyrdom and suffering. She is said to have walked in the wake of her mother as travelers spread the first plague and borne the agony of those afflicted, granting them reprieve in lieu of her mother's folly. Since then, Palanthia has adopted the sick and the weary into her faith, and lepers and the cursed are said to sometimes be cured by making the Traveler's Pilgrimage. Esparath never fully recovered from the first suffering, and as a result she is also the goddess of pain. Her faithful are never with her for long, usually passing from the world. She soothes the wounded in battle as they die, and consoles mothers when their children are taken early.

I originally posted this to my blog, but I'm not a regular, recognizable contributor yet, so I'll settle for a little copy-paste. Let me know what you think and if you have thoughts on the gods, the religions, the fables, or on my opinionated rant on alignment.",1,Use My Gods: A Mythological Pantheon and Sermon on Alignment
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,72,1020,"Full NPC's aren't allowed over at r/DMAcademy, so let's try here.

My campaign has officially fizzled out due to personal issues amongst my players (breakups suck) and as such, I'm losing all my favorite NPC's. That being the case, I would like for my personal favorite creation to live on in other games.

Khajid is a stark white Tabaxi merchant who travels the lands with his caravan of magical oddities, The Stirred Pot. The Stirred Pot is a typical magic item caravan. I would stock it with 2-3 level appropriate wondrous items and 4-5 items rolled from a magic loot table. The catch with The Stirred Pot is that Khajid will give you a discount if you give him a good rumor. This is my secret tool for having players actually pay attention and remember story beats. Want that immovable rod at a steep discount? Then you better have remembered that the Lord of the land is having an affair! If your players decide to be little shits and lie to Khajid, his +15 to insight will probably beat whatever deception they manage. In this case, prices for the afformentioned liar are doubled for life, and they will only be referred to as ""liar"" from then on.

Khajid always seems to be around when it's convenient. This is due to the fact that he's a very high level druid, and travels the land using Transport Via Plants. In my specific game he was a level 20 circle of dreams druid due to plot reasons, but he can be whatever you want him to in yours.

Khajid is also a walking side quest machine when you have some downtime or missing players. Here are a few I used that you can springboard off:

The Missing Haversack: Khajid keeps a ludicrous amount of Handy Haversacks. He's got to keep all the goods somewhere, right? However, during your shopping spree, you notice (DC 10 insight), that Khajid is nervously fidgeting around his caravan. Upon asking, one of his Haversacks is missing. In my campaign, this Haversack contained a ton of gold and 3 cards to the Deck of Many Things (We have a long running quest to retrieve the cards). In your campaign, it could be anything!

An Uninvited Journey: Up until now, the player's have noticed that Khajid purposefully takes his time leaving via plants, taking the whole six seconds allowing no one behind him. This time, he is in a rush and leaves immediately, leaving 5 seconds of the spell left for players to follow suit. A DC 15 dexterity check from the majority of the party will allow them all to pass through. On the other side is a deep, dark wooded area, home to many other worldly flora and fauna. In my personal campaign, these woods held portals to the feywild and a pathway to the underdark, and allowed for a fun no-rails style session.

Khajid fills the roll of a convenient place to spend gold while also having an explanation as to why he's always around. Playing their cards right, he can also be a powerful ally.",1,Steal My NPC: Khajid the Traveling Merchant
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,100,334,"This is my first version. I felt the need to create this from a few situations in which my players tried to kill someone who was sleeping and just failing to kill them with one hit, even though they had a knife to the throat or to the heart of the person. So here it is, please be as critic as you want.

**KILL HELPLESS/SLEEPING/UNCONSCIOUS CREATURE**

If a Dexterity (Stealth) check is required, it must be successful against either the enemy’s passive Perception or the enemy’s Wisdom (Perception) check with the circumstance bonus or penalty depending on the situation.

The attacker must know a specific target on a creature that causes instant death. On humanoids, for example, this could be the head, the neck or the heart. Only by knowing this, the following rule applies:

* The attacker has “double” advantage on a melee attack roll made against the helpless creature. The hit is an automatic critical hit and deals maximum damage. A rogue’s sneak attack is applied here, as they have even more expertise in attacking the vital parts of creatures than other people.
* If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points it dies outright, unless it has some trait or feature that prevents that from happening (effects such as the *death ward* spell, for example).
* A creature that isn’t reduced to 0 hit points, is then reduced to 0 hit points and starts making death saving throws.",1,My first try at creating a rule for killing helpless characters
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,21,58,"So I DM regularly on a Twitch channel, the campaign is coming to an end and it's unlikely the players will find this item at this point. So I've decided to release it to the masses. Enjoy.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,369,"*Most often we only see the entrance of sea caves never delving further to stray from the beaches.  I tell you there is much more to a cave on the coast than many give them credit for.* - Druid of the 7th Circle

---------------------------------

# Introduction

When exploring further into caves along the sea researchers have come back with all new variations of some creatures adapted to life in both water and caves.  These often secluded areas provide unique adaptations for life to survive and even thrive.

-----------------------------------

## Eel Plesiosaurs [...](https://redd.it/3ddyay)

Uniquely adapted to hide in the protection of a sea cave the Eel Plesiosaur is an ambush predator.  With large bulbous eyes that proportionally are 3 times the size of any other snatcher (as halflings call them).  Their necks are hard to tell from their bodies as they are only slightly different in width.  The only way you can really tell the body is by small fins 2 on each side.  Structurally they are the same as any Plesiosaur but have immensely thicker and longer necks.  Only found in coastal regions where deep sea caves can be in the shores.  They are air breathers and depend on the tides to recede far enough for them to breath.  They can hold their breath for up to a day but much longer they will have to leave their protective den.

---------------------------------------

## Coastal Lizardfolk [...](https://redd.it/4134hi)

Lizardfolk, as discovered previously, are usually found near water although up to this point only fresh water.  However with the further exploration of coastal sea caves we've discovered tribes of smaller lizardfolk that dwell in these areas.  These lizardfolk are quite similar to their larger brethren in society but are only about 3 feet tall at most.  Colored with brilliant teals and blues they blend well in the more tropical reefs they hunt in for food.  Usually very secluded often they avoid contact with other sentient races, however, a pirate or 2 has been boarded and raided by what they called ""tiny Sea Trolls"".

-----------------------------------

## Salt Water Catoblepas [...](https://redd.it/6ap7if)

Larger and deadly omnivores the Catoblepases are already rare creatures and these cave dwelling varieties are even more so.  Thought to have been moaning ghosts of shipwrecked sailors or heartbroken wives, the whails of the Salt Water Catoblepas are haunting indeed.  Low throaty to high reverberating calls echoing out of caves as they look for a mate.  While this only occurs for a small portion of their life, the memory to outsiders of such a call can last eons.  Dark purple in hue and usually just as large as the swamp-dwelling varieties, not many caves near oceans can house these slow moving beasts.  Retaining the death ray as described hunting can be a quick endeavor.  They will usually persist on the many mushrooms and plants in these cave systems more often with a meal of flesh occasionally.

------------------------------------------------

## SeaWeed Hydras [...](https://redd.it/63zx1m)

True to their amazing adaptability, we're discovering even more Hydra as we explore.  SeaWeed Hydras are adapted to live in shallow water caves near the seas often disguised as patches of green sea plants floating in calm pools.  They have long leafy dark green flanges that appear as tall seaweed or algae.  As many Hydras, they are ambush predators snapping at creatures coming to close to them in their homes.  They have adapted to both air and water breathing with heads seemingly at random having gills to process air from water.

Thanks for reading!  Linked under the ... is the original Eco I wrote to support the more specific details of the larger species.  If you would like to read more ecologies and my supplemental articles you can do so [here](https://redd.it/8p0qt1)",1,Environmental Ecological Variations: Sea Caves
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,52,"I recently read a post about why someone had made enchantment magic illegal in their work. It drove people insane etc. Now I thought this was a fascinating Idea but the consequences were to harsh for my setting so in this post I'm proposing an alternate version of the same idea. Specifically a softer effect for long term charm spells such as geas. 

The two examples of player spells that relate to this idea are geas and to a lesser extent antipathy/sympathy. The common factor that both these spells have is they encourage the victim to take a certain action but when under the effects of the spell they maintain their free will. Geas being a perfect example. If you don't violate the restrictions you can do whatever you want and the victim is conscious and aware of the entire experience. Moving into the territory of non-player spells this idea becomes far more relevant in cases of possession or long term influence. 

If a person is possessed by a ghost or their mind is subtly influenced by a outside force such as a good or demon they may never notice while under the effects but once the effects cease they suddenly lose something they've become accustomed too.

Mechanically this expresses itself as regular will saves.

If a sentient being is under the effects of some form of mind altering magic (see enchantment magic or ghostly influence)  for a period longer than a week have them make a dc 10 will save at the start of each day, increasing the difficulty of the roll by 1 each time they succeed. 

On a failed save no immediate effect manifests but they stop making saves. If the effects of the enchantment magic or other outside influence are removed and the being in question has failed the save they display symptoms of addiction.

Failing the save represents that the person has become reliant on the outside influence accepting it as a part of their mind. Hence the loss of this influence causes a intense feeling of loneliness which drives the affected being to constantly seek something to fill this void. 

Example: 
Your heroic party of adventurers has freed the villages of stone town front the clutches of a evil demon worshipping cult. Escorting them back home the villagers show signs of unrest. In the dark of the night you feel the cold, hardness of metal against your throat and see own to the villagers staring back at you with blood shot eyes. He begins screaming at you saying "" you robbed us of her glory. We're empty so empty..."" trailing off into sobs the villager prepare to drive his blade home into your throat.

This same scene could play out with cultists players attempt to reform among others. To heal this effect you'd need a greater restoration or other equivalent spell. By making the effect difficult cure especially on a large scale it two forces the role play consequences of the use of these spells, no poor villager is going to have access to 5th level spell giving these spells a lingering effect on their victims hopefully giving your villains or your players actions a strong narrative impact.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,50,754,"Hello, this is my first post in this community and I want to share something I've been using successfully for the last three years.

&amp;#x200B;

I DM'd a sandbox campaign and I was in need of lots of random encounter tables, but I'm also a ""wing it"" type of DM so I made my own encounter table, designed to be easy, even to be memorized, and add some of the stuff I want to see in my games to remember to include it from time to time. So it's more of an **inspiration table.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's originally designed for wilderness travels but it worked for dungeons and urban exploration.

Of course, you can **tweak the table**, moving categories up and down as you want them to happen. You can also choose how often you want to roll on the table depending on how eventful you want the exploration to be.

* Roll **2d10 and take the lowest**.
* **Double digits** means an **exceptional result**, something related to an ongoing plot or something that brings backs the effects of the players' actions.
* You can use the **second die** to determine **secondary data** if needed: Number, difficulty, time, etc...
* You need to know beforehand what kind of inhabitants, fauna and monsters reside in the area.

# Examples: In the jungle

&amp;#x200B;

* \[10, 9: Magic, wonder\] There is a stone totem covered in vines. Its face is savage and disfigured, its eyes look like two emeralds. When the characters approach, the totem starts wailing and a thick, green tear-like liquid flows from the eyes. Any character trying to remove the emeralds will be cursed, crying non-stop until their next critical success. Drinking the liquid gives the blinded condition for 1d6 hours. Comforting the crying idol grants a blessing and makes the idol stop crying.
* \[7, 4: People's signs\] Distant drums echo through the woods. If the group isn't careful they might attract some savages. If they follow the sound they'll find 7 savages.
* \[3, 4: Minor setback\] This area of the jungle is swamped. The first ""lucky"" players to ""notice"" it will need to make a Constitution save DC13 to escape from the quicksand of they'll start drowning.
* \[7, 10: Secondary monster\] These are the hunting grounds of a group of 2d4 arborean raptors. Ambush!
* \[9, 2: Interesting detail or place\] This area of the jungle seems less densely-packed with trees, long vines hang down to the ground, and the floor is covered with guano and hundreds of little bones.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,45,442,"# The Urban Druid

Ecosystems come in all forms, and the ""urban jungle"" is no exception. It has a ground, mid-and-upper canopies, and some have an underground. There is life, myriad in its composition, all over the urban landscape. It is here that the *urbana flaminis*, the Urban Druid, takes its place as shepherd, shaman, and steward of this natural/unnatural place. 

Urban Druids tend to the gardens, parks, wildlife, and cobbled ecosystems that can be found within a cityscape. Their allies are the stray cat and dog, the pigeon, the owl, the roach, the rat and the snake. Their terrain crosses and crisscrosses over miles of stone and wood, and a mid-sized city with half-a-dozen parks may only have 1 or 2 druids in attendence - each constantly on the move like the Judges of the Old West. They listen to the troubles and complaints of the locals, brew tisanes and make poultices for the infirm and sick, and mete out justice when the legal mechanisms fail to uphold their responsibilities. Some serve as religious leaders, ministering to flocks of city folk who wish to remain in contact with the old, natural ways, in spite of their modern lifestyles. 

Urban Druids can be formidable foes. Some are able to call upon Urban Rangers, who generally serve in very large cityscapes, to aid them in times of crisis. Many attempt to ally with the guilds and factions that surround their natural guardianships, and are skilled at both diplomacy and guerilla warfare. It is said that the Weeping Willow park in downtown Galron was the result of a war with an Urban Druid that turned both sides into sleeping trees - a fully grown garden that sprang up overnight and turned a crossroads into a 4 acre open-air parkland. 

Urban Druids are limited in their ability to wildshape - they must take only forms that are commonly found (as mentioned in the list of allies, above), and they rarely get to commune with others of their Order through standing stones or other natural conduits. 

Their navigational and survival abilities are geared towards the urban landscape. They will be well versed in traveling through any of the parts of the biosphere, from sewer to rooftop, and many cultivate food and healing plants and herbs in secluded locations against future need. Safe houses abound (sometimes within stately trees and boulders!) and they are in constant contact with others of their kind, if any are present. 



# NPC Examples

* **Map**: This Druid lives in the sewers of a large city. He could rightfully be called a Guardian Druid, but his senses extend the length and width of the city. If something occurs, Map knows about it. He is unfriendly and has no time for non-Druids (or most Druids, either). He will never leave his underground lair unless forced. His purpose is to protect the city as a whole. 

* **Bogs Wallop**: This Gnomish Druid lives as migrant, moving from green space to green space within the city. He tends to the gardens, assists the feral animal population (of which there are many individuals), and tries to ensure that any visitors to the green spaces respect the simple rules that govern these areas (no open fires, no littering, no destruction of property). Unfortunately, these rules are not always adhered to, and in these times the Druid will sometimes take the wildshape of a large brown bear and try to scare off the offenders. The Druid wants only to be left alone to do his work, and it not concerned with the larger concerns of society and politics.

* **Nishka Harun**: This elven Druid primarily dwells in abandoned buildings or in sections of the sewer system that are not frequently visited by others. She is an Avenger Druid and has taken it upon herself to punish those whom she sees as wrongdoers. Her weapons in this war are the vermin that surround her - the pigeon, the rats, the roaches, the fleas, the flies, and any feral animals that she comes across. This is her ""Vermin Army"" and woe to anyone whom she deems as worthy of her revenge. Her personality is driven  by an event in her past when her former superior (a high-level Druid) was found to have been corrupted, and many hundreds died in a successful terrorist plot planned by her superior. 


# Plot Hooks

* A druid finds the party, lost in a vast urban landscape. The druid offers to show them a shortcut in exchange for the delivery of a message to a dangerous individual.
* The party is confronted by a druid who claims that this part of the city is forbidden to outsiders and will back up his claim with a very large rat swarm (200 individuals) and a dozen feral dogs. 
* A druid on a woven mat is selling herbal remedies at half the price of the commercial shops. The druid claims that the city provides all it needs to survive if we know where to look. If friendly, the Druid will ask the party to harvest some rare herbs in exchange for some herbal recipes. 
* The party is stalked through the city by a huge pack of feral dogs (20+ individuals). The leader is a shapechanged Druid and is simply keeping an eye on some dangerous individuals (the party). If the party starts any trouble, the pack will intervene. 
* The city's parks have been closed down by overgrown plant growth and the local Druid council has declared them off limits until the crisis is over (the details of which are not announced).
* The city's trees have been Awakened into a malevolent state and the local Druids are attempting to contain them, with little success.

Hey everyone! I'm glad to say that after a few months I decided to pick up my Racial Stat Chart again and try to make it work better. In a few days I was able to improve the logic used in the sheet and make things a lot prettier than before. If you want some further details as to how to use the sheet and how it works, read below. Otherwise, the link is above.

The sheet works by using a simple logical 'and' system, checking each race for the determined qualities that you need. For example, does the race provide strength *and* dexterity *and* is included in at least one of the allowed sources? If so, it is displayed. I also did some fancy conditional formatting to highlight and cross out whenever a race is not included in the specified sources. You can hover over the stats to see what checks they are used for as well as what classes use them.

I've had a few requests recently from people wanting me to update the sheet, which is what inspired me to work on it again. My previous method had some really crappy logicals and made it hard to update for any future races WotC publishes, but I've made sure to make the sheet able to be updated easier now. Hopefully you guys enjoy, and if you have any suggestions feel free to post them in the comments below!",1,5e Racial Stat Bonus Chart v2.0
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,17,247,"Hi guys. The following is a small, contained dungeon that I ran as a one-off when taking over from someone else's campaign. I like the idea of dungeons that can be placed inside of any setting, and this one is effective because it is literally just plonking down a self-contained adventure into any landscape.

It was written to be more humorous than grim, and to have a balance of roleplaying and combat encounters. That said, the script could easily be rewritten to make this a pure combat dungeon, or indeed a light-hearted one with no fighting at all. I hope you enjoy it.

**THE GRAND AND HISTORIC HOUSE OF MESMERIC BIJOUX AND EQUIPAGE AND OTHER PHANTASTICAL WHIMSIES**

Or

*Some Nights at the Museum*

&amp;nbsp;

**Synopsis**


A colossal building has quite suddenly teleported into a nearby countryside. This is not normal. The humans swear that it wasn't their fault, the gnomes are clueless. The elves won't go near the thing. Goes against the nature of buildings really, flying around and crash landing. Some of the peasants have gone up to see it, said it looks a bit like a city hall. But bigger. Much bigger.

Still- doesn't really matter. Somebody's going to have to explore this new place. Never mind the strange arcs of colour that filter out of its windows, the unearthly screams, the occasional quake that spangles the ground with loose masonry. It can't be *that* bad inside.

&amp;nbsp;

**Themes**

The Grand and Historic House of Mesmeric Bijoux and Equipage and Other Phantastical Whimsies, also known colloquially as The House, is a mystery-themed dungeon for a group of adventurers of any level. It deals primarily with occult Victorian themes, and is written to allow for the natural generation of humour and suspense. As it is almost completely impossible to actually guess the real problem with the House, the central mystery cannot be taken too seriously- though obviously humour your players to whatever they become invested in.

&amp;nbsp;

**Setup**

The nice thing about literally dropping a building into a landscape is that hooks are relatively easy to write. Even if the players don't notice the House teleporting into their dimension, the sudden manifestation of the museum is likely to cause quite a stir amongst any nearby NPCs. The House can be used as a tool to advance the goals of some other NPC, or it can simply be a curiosity that the party explores organically.

&amp;nbsp;

**DM Notes**

As this is a relatively small dungeon, the House doesn't require a lot of strategic thought or narrative trickery to deal with. It can be presented as a grim Victorian area with a splash of surrealism, or as a more light-hearted adventure with a host of occult museum curators. Just remember that the Museum Staff are not aware of why the House has teleported, and desire only to return to their home dimension.

There are only two twists to remember: the first is that the obvious villain of the dungeon, Ms. Encarria Lych, is not the actual villain at all. She should be haughty, indignant, and act as a reverse Scooby Doo bad guy. However, as the main villain is actually &gt;!the undead dinosaur wizard, mention the dinosaur bones enough that the players are aware of the number of dinosaurs in the House!&lt;.

&amp;nbsp;

**Acts**

&amp;nbsp;

**Act I: The Entrance**

&amp;nbsp;

Depending on how knowledgeable or aware the party is on their way into the building, they'll notice a few things. The stones that make up the incredible façades of the building are not from around here. The architecture is stylish, though of an unfamiliar style. All writing is in a crazed, alien script. The building, titanic as it is, seems to be proportioned to human size. 

Once the party makes it inside the front doors of the House, they find themselves observing a pitched battle between the museum staff, lead by NPC Sir Phineas Armoire II, and a rogue exhibit (say, a collection of statues riding wooden ants, a literal cloud of hammers, or a sentient pantry and its horde of carnivorous vegetables). Once the characters save the museum staff, and figure out how to communicate with them, they will be informed that although the staff have no idea how the museum got here, they're trying desperately to return home. Sir Phineas II reckons he can teleport the building back with three key ingredients: 


1) A Sulphur Core, last seen with Doctor Silas Ramsay in the Arboretum

2) The *Dislocation Journals*, written by the Curator of the Art Gallery, Ms. Encarria Lych

3) A Pinch of Splendour, which should be with Doctor Chaya Foxworth in the Astronomy Department


As far as roleplaying is concerned, the Staff are an affable lot, essentially identical to a Victorian English staff, except they have gargantuan lightning rifles fed by backpack-mounted power sources.

&amp;nbsp;

**Act II: The Arboretum**

&amp;nbsp;

As the players make their way past the weird number of dinosaur skeletons, they find themselves in the Arboretum. It's hot, it's sweaty, it probably used to be really nice before all the exhibits got loose and the glass broke everywhere. There are lots of potential combat encounters here- fungal dogs, carnivorous plants, sentient butterfly swarms, etc. 

Doctor Silas Ramsay has locked himself in his own exhibit cell, and refuses to open the pressure door. Any conversations had with the players will have to be done through muffled shouting, as he's got about four inches of reinforced glass protecting him. He's holding the Sulphur Core like a grenade launcher, and he'll be damned if he's leaving the cell before the players can confirm they've killed something he calls a Brightflower.

The Brightflower is a mind-controlling plant that has captured and possessed most of the Arboretum's staff. It is currently basking in the heat of one of the museum's boilers, so the combat encounter between the party, the Brightflower, and the horde of zombified museum staff members will take place in a large, sweltering room. As the control panel for the boiler is basically unintelligible, pulling random levers and knobs can add a randomness to the fight. Once the Brightflower is killed, Doctor Ramsay will emerge from his cell and surrender the Core. He'll be much happier with the party if they didn't murder all of his staff, who will return to normal after the Brightflower is killed. He will absolutely mention that Ms. Encarria Lych has been behaving erratically as of late, and will return to the safety of the Entrance Hall when he's happy with the situation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Act III: The Art Gallery**

&amp;nbsp;

The Art Gallery is, unsurprisingly, absolutely filled with different paintings, sculptures, mosaics, pieces of pottery, and everything in between. Combat encounters could potentially include a painting-hopping blue paint elemental, a host of partying statues that demand a competition with the party, and a ghostly collection of instruments that make a phantom orchestra. The Art Gallery also has several wheeled wrought-iron mirrors, which may be useful for when the players explore the Astronomy Department.

Once the players find Encarria Lych, she will be aghast at their sudden intrusion and will immediately threaten to set her Turpentine Golem on them. This is not a joke- the Golem is about four meters tall and is similarly acrid in temperament. Ms. Lych will immediately attempt to hide whatever she was doing, and demand to know what the party wants. She will surrender her *Journals* with some trepidation, and will refuse to accompany the party back to the Entrance Hall.

Ms. Encarria Lych has been attempting to paint a portrait of Sir Phineas Armoire II for several weeks, in preparation for his birthday. She can't get it right, and the stress is making her furious. This true motive will not be obvious unless the players take some drastic measures (interrogating her, killing her, or sneaking around her office). The party should definitely Feel Bad if they take a darker route to inspecting Ms. Lych.

&amp;nbsp;

**Act IV: The Astronomy Department**

&amp;nbsp;

The halls to the Astronomy Department are unique in the House, because they are bathed in a subtle amber light. Indeed, opening the door to the first exhibit in the Department reveals why- the entire room is empty, save for an exhibit labelled *The Summersmith's Skull*. A glorious and blinding light is shining out of a crack in the exhibit case, which is made of thick smoked glass. Viewing the exhibit through the glass reveals what looks like for all intents and purposes a purple human skull.

Breaking the exhibit is a bad idea, because the Skull has roughly identical properties to a star the size of a human head.

The Astronomy Department has a few potential encounters. The first is with a lunar elemental, which is a sort of combination of an angry squid and a sword collection, which the party can find within a room that is set inside with two rotating gyroscopes (it seemed like a good idea at the time). The second is with Doctor Chaya Foxwith, who actually has the Pinch of Splendour with her. Doctor Foxwith won't give the party the Pinch until they deal with a rather more serious issue- the Astronomy Department has lost its Ixoloth.

The Ixoloth, which basically looks like an owl, a moth, a fungus, and a worm, was recovered from a comet impact a few decades ago. They thought it was dead, but it appears to be waking up, and it is *extremely angry*. It speaks with two voices- the first sounds a lot like human blood being simultaneously boiled and frozen, and the second appears to generate localised gravitational distortions. It doesn't appear to be saying anything in particular, it's just generally vile-sounding.

Killing the Ixoloth is tricky. For one, it damages XP directly, so any fight with it will be costly. For two, it's actually a part of the host of terrible watchers who lurk outside every solar system, waiting billions of years to eat the stars. Fighting it directly is a Bad Idea. This one is still groggy from its stasis, though it gains strength and intelligence every day it is awake. 

The easiest way to kill the Ixoloth will be to expose it directly to the light of the Summersmith's Skull, but it's not stupid enough to be lured into that trap. Using the mirrors from the Gallery might do the trick. Either way, when Doctor Foxworth is happy with the results, she'll give the Pinch of Splendour to the party.

&amp;nbsp;

**Act V: The Basement**

&amp;nbsp;

When the party returns to the Entrance Hall with all three ingredients, they'll find Sir Phineas asleep in a sort of armoured yurt. He'll be guarded by a burly Staff member with a lightning cannon. If the players wake up Sir Phineas, they'll find a pair of tiny dinosaur skeletons stealing a necklace by his bedside.

Chasing the dinosaurs (or killing them) should in some way trigger the appearance of the actual main villain of the House. She'll be found either underneath the Hall, in a basement, or she'll simply break her way through the floor and demand an audience. She is Queen Horatia Brutality, an undead t-rex wizard who spent decades attempting to teleport the House back to the distant past, so she could be rid of the grotesque apes that keep her and her court in museum exhibits. Although she worked on the maths for about thirty years, she made a mistake, and teleported the museum sideways in space, rather than backwards in time. When she appears, *every single fossil* in the museum will begin to animate. Even the ones that are only partially complete. Even the petrified flowers! Those ones in particular won't do much, but the triceratops and giant sloths might.

Queen Horatia will demand that the party give her the Sulphur Core, the *Dislocation Journals*, and the Pinch of Splendour. She will attempt to teleport the House back in time again, though this time she claims she'll get it right. She won't, because dinosaurs are pretty stupid and pretty bad at maths, but she'll keep trying. 

Obviously the Staff do not want this, so the players are left with the choice of helping the museum staff or helping the dinosaurs. Either way, the fight should be a great time. 

Regardless of who wins the fight (unless literally everybody dies), the museum should be shifted out of the player's dimension only a few hours afterwards. The prizes and rewards that you give the party are extremely variable, and really up to you. Either way, hopefully they had fun, and if they didn't then honestly there's no saving them because I personally think that t-rex liches are great.",1,Dungeon: Transdimensional Museum Mystery

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,81,543,"Recently, within my Wednesday group, I brought up the idea of playing Gestalt Characters. For those unfamiliar, a Gestalt Character is a character which has a pair of classes, rather than a single class. It was initially in 3.5e, and i haven't heard much about it in 5th. I've done a bit of testing, and all my players are excited to do more. And I am excited to share the concept with you all, ported to 5th Edition.

I've written out the character creation rules for a Gestalt campaign within a Homebrewery document, which can be found [Here](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/H1OBqNJDN) for anyone who is interested in checking them out.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: This covers the basic rules. The link contains a few Variant Rules and other additional information.

# Gestalt

Gestalt is a variant character creation rule which was present in D&amp;D 3.5e. To put it simply, a Gestalt Character is a character who has full class progression of 2 classes simultaneously, with the experience gain as though they had a single class.

In practice, Gestalt is one way to give your players quite a bit more power, even at low levels of play. Having access to the options a second class gives you can give any class quite a bit more power. Giving an Abjuration Wizard the power of Armor of Agathys, having full progression between 2 of Warlock/Sorcerer/Paladin, giving an Assassin Rogue the Shadow-bending powers of a Shadow Monk, anything is possible.

While it may seem that Gestalt Characters break the balance of the game, it is important to note that a gestalt class, while it will outpace a standard character, will not outpace the normal balance of the game by a ton. Your players will have more versatile characters, but not more Powerful characters, per se. The 3.5 Source of Gestalt suggests that a party of 4 will be able to handle creatures of about 1 CR higher than normal, with exception given to 'save or die' creatures such as the Medusa or Basilisk, since players having better saving throws make them worse overall.

## Original Source of the Homebrew

[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/gestaltCharacters.htm](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/gestaltCharacters.htm)

## Preface

To Preface, D&amp;D 5e does have rather good rules for handling the interactions between multiple classes. Any rules which are not mentioned within this document likely have a solution which is covered by basic rules, or basic multiclassing rules.

## Creating a Gestalt Character

When creating a Gestalt Character, from whichever level you begin, you choose 2 different classes. This class pairing is now your Gestalt class. Despite being a character that has 2 classes, your progression is handled as though you only had one. Anything which refers to your total character level treats your combined level as the level both your pairings have. This is referred to as your Gestalt level from now onwards.

*Example: Building a Fighter1/Bard1, i would have a Gestalt level of 1, Proficiency bonus of +2, etc.*

## Your First Level

As a Gestalt Character, you will have 2 seperate class pages to reference for building your Level 1 character. As a general rule, you will be able to pick the best of either class.

* **HP**: The Hit Die you use is whichever class has the higher hit die.

*The Fighter has a d10, while the Bard has a d8. When using Hit Dice, we will always use the Fighter's d10. Your Starting HP is 10+CON, your Hit Die is 1d10 per Gestalt Level, and when levelling up, your HP increases by 1d10(6) + CON*

* **Weapon/Armor/Tool Proficiency**: Take any option offered by either class.

*The Fighter gains access to Simple/Martial weapons, as well as All Armor/Shields. The Bard has lesser Weapons and Armors, but brings 3 Instruments as Tool Proficiencies. In the end, Fighter/Bard will have All Armor/Shields, Simple/Martial Weapons, and 3 Instruments.*

* **Starting Equipment**: Start with Anything from Either List, unless the DM has a reason to limit it.

*From the Bard List, it makes sense to take Longsword, Entertainer's Pack, and Musical Instrument. From Fighter, Chainmail sounds nice, as well as Another Martial Weapon, the Shield, and a Pair of Handaxes.*

* **Saving Throws and Skills**: For Saving Throws, choose one class as your Base Class. You will gain both of their saving throws, and one extra saving throw from the other class. For Skills, repeat the process, choosing one class as base for skills, and taking one from the other class's list.

*Fighter brings STR and CON saves to the table, while Bard offers DEX and CHA saves. I'll take fighter as the base, and choose Bard's DEX saves, leaving us with proficiency in STR, DEX and CON saves.*

*For Skills, Bard offers us 3 from any list, while Fighter offers us 2 from a limited list. Choosing bard as the base, I will have more skills, and better options, so in the end i will have 1 skill from the fighter list, and 3 of any other skills.*

## At Higher Levels

When levelling up, you will gain the abilities from both classes at the rate in which a normal class would obtain them. Any Feature which you would gain access to twice, Such as Extra Attack, or Spellcasting, you only follow the progression of whichever class has the Stronger Feature. As an Example, Paladin/Sorcerer would have full-caster progression from Sorcerer, and would Ignore the Paladin's Spellcasting feature when considering spell slots, or a Fighter/Barbarian would only have 2 attacks per turn at 5, and gain more at 11 and 20 (From Fighter). Refer to this rule as **Single Progression**

When using spellcasting, Despite the Single Progression rule, still prepare/learn/cast spells as though you had both spellcasting classes. Single Progression will only effect the number of Spell Slots you have per day.

## Flavor Additions

As a personal rule, I recommend giving your Gestalt Character combination a special name. Since a character who learns, or gets stronger at an increased rate, this could manifest itself as a title or nickname within the game.

I recommend using a name which is relevant to the character you wish to roleplay, *such as Ninja for Shadow Monk/Rogue*, or relevant to the class combination, *such as Theurge for Cleric/Wizard*.

I hope each of you are as excited for this as me and my group are.",1,5th Edition Gestalt - Rules for Combination Classes for a high-power campaign
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,23,125,"In my setting, I like the creation of magic items to feel a lot more involved. As a result, I often have characters supply specific rare materials in order to create magic items. Sometimes these resources come from creatures directly (such as dragon scales or Umber Hulk chitin) but other resources are more traditional materials. Xanathar's Guide introduced some nice rules for such a system on page 129, but outside of Mithral and Adamantine, D&amp;D 5e doesn't really mention many materials that are useful for creating magic items. So I decided to create my own magical resources for my setting and share some of them here. Hopefully, these are useful for inspiring your own work or perhaps you'll feel inclined to include them directly.

#Elven Gossamer

Many centuries ago when the Weave was stronger, the elves were capable of creating a type of magical silk that made incredibly tough armour and exquisitely comfortable clothing. Creating elven gossamer now seems impossible, so all sources of it are kept as prized possessions or looted from tombs and ruins. The Drow seem to have retained the ability to make a material similar to elven gossamer, sometimes called Dark Gossamer or Drow Silk. The Drow make this from spider silk and imbue the material with Lolth's dark blessing. However, any magic item creating with this dark gossamer permanently loses its magic when exposed to sunlight for too long.

Elven gossamer makes very strong light armour and can even supplement medium and heavy armour creation when combined with mithral. Additionally, most magic items created with elven gossamer are Boots and Cloaks of Elven Kind.

#Luminous Platinum

As the myth goes, luminous platinum was showered across the Elam Desert by the god of good dragons Bahamut. The god cast some of his own scales, some as large as buildings, and they crashed through the sand forming rich veins of this mystic metal. Due to its appearance, luminous platinum is often mistaken for mithral but luminous platinum is considerably denser and lacks the untarnishable nature of mithral. In ore veins, luminous platinum glows a faint blue, making it easy to spot in caverns.

Luminous platinum is highly prized for its use in arcane focuses. Some of the most powerful wands and staves are crafted using the metal and it seems to have an innate property connecting it to the weave. Due to its connection to Bahamut, luminous platinum wands are very popular amongst draconic sorcerers. In addition to arcane focuses, luminous platinum is sometimes minted into coins. These coins are known as ""Bahamut Scales"" and they have a value of 50 gold pieces. Due to their rarity and somewhat exclusivity to the Elam Desert, they are often kept as prized trinkets by nobles in other lands.

#Sentient Timber

Powerful and ancient Treants are created from some of the strongest nature magic found within the Weave. When slain, their timber can be used to create powerful magic items associated with nature, but it is equally useful for creating sentient magic items as the timber is already accustomed to containing a life essence. Due to most Treants being good-aligned, killing them for their timber is generally considered an evil act and many enchanters will refuse to use the ingredient in their craft. Rarely, a treant will willingly shed a branch from itself to reward loyal servants, most often powerful druids and other guardians of nature.

Sentient timber is often used to create druid focuses as well as wooden weapons and shields. Many of these magic items exhibit some form of nature magic within them. There is a popular legend of a powerful monk that would patrol forests armed with a sentient timber quarterstaff.

#Shadowed Iron and Shadowed Timber

Sometimes when crossings to the Shadowfell open, the dark energy seeps through and manifests inside iron ore veins or through forests. Both materials adopt a black colour and their ability to reflect light is greatly diminished. Due to its association with the Shadowfell, both shadowed iron and shadowed timber are seen as products of pure evil by many. Both materials are incredibly popular amongst followers of the Raven Queen as they seem to make superior holy symbols for her clerics and paladins.

Due to their ties to the Shadowfell, both shadowed iron and shadowed timber are ideal for creating magic items that benefit stealth or magic items designed to inflict necrotic damage. Magic items created from these materials seem to have a latent effect that induces depressions for their users.

Hopefully, these magical materials are inspiring for your own creations. I had a lot of fun writing them and using them within my campaign so far, it would be awesome if other DMs can benefit too.",1,Materials For Magic Items
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,95,"So this is a first post of an encounter concept I came up with when rereading one of my favourite Pratchett’ stories, Thief Of Time.

My favourite elements are the concept of a fight in frozen time, the Procrastinators (that you can’t charge yourself), the Auditors, and that getting out involves smashing a big clock. I’ve brought those together with some rules for a fun combat. The most challenging element is keeping the Auditors skills in check. I really felt that a monster that learns your skills from you is a pretty cool concept. 

**The setting:** An optional set up for the combat what might have happened before to get the players into this mess. 

**Combat changer:** Combats are fun but can get repetitive, This is how I suggest you make the combat more hectic without just throwing enemies at the players.

**The monster:** Does what it says on the tin

## The setting

*Sitting in the wizard’s workshop you hear him grumbling and mumbling to himself. Trilby the ever-paranoid has an inkling that his longtime rival Thornton is messing with forces far beyond his control. He’s started some long rant about time being more like a load of large men wrestling on a rubber sheet when everything turns to crystal. Ice blue lines cover each surface and are slowly receding across your body, you hear your heat give a few slow beats before returning to normal. Before you screwdriver hangs in the air, in terror, you turn to look out the window. Seeing that all of the Canyons have come to a stop, great riding dragons frozen mid flap and flying ships nailed to the sky. For all but you and, you’d guess from the fussings of Trilby, the wizard it appears that time has stopped.* 

Some damn fool has stopped time, thankfully you were with Trilby. He’s slapped a Time Battery onto each of your and sent you to go smash, break or otherwise stop whatever is messing with the time streams. He suspects that Thornton might be to blame as he stole some Tachyogauges off him recently and set you off across the frozen city to go investigate the laboratories.

## Combat changer

*These vibrating backpacks appear cobbled out of a steel cylinder and some leather straps. A crank juts out from the top of the cylinder. Mystic runes are cut crudely into the leather and etched onto the steel.* 

The Time Battery is the device that allows the players to move through this frozen world. Unfortunately, Trilby isn’t much of a designer and has left a couple of problems with it. The batteries are strapped to the player’s backs and require recharging by someone standing behind the player or some other inventive solution to spin the crank. If the player’s pack runs down they get stuck in time and can only rejoin the fight if they are wound back up.

How fast they wind down is up to you, it should be easily trackable by players though. I personally like using two rules in combat and out of combat. When out of combat don’t track it, it’s a pain for players to keep stopping to charge and can ruin the flow. 

In combat, it’s a resource. The more a player does the more the pack runs down. If they don’t have a chance to charge up before the battle allows them 10+ 1d20 points, the batteries can hold a maximum charge of 30 points. These points are consumed for every action a player takes, that includes movement, reactions and bonus actions. To give you an idea each player can expect to consume a minimum two points every round so a six-round combat will run them down twelve points without any reactions or bonus actions. 

This introduces some interesting questions for players. A low beginning number will limit their options, A high number might make them overconfident. It also challenges the players to think of recharging the battery by having another player use an action to crank the lever. I think giving 2d4+5 (or +dex bonus if you want more player agency) is a good way to resolve the kind of charge boost the player gets. The constant threat of dropping out of the world means that people need to think carefully about how to survive long combats.

## The monster

*These things look human, two ears, two eyes, a nose and a mouth it’s all there but it doesn’t have that spark of true life about it. Their faces are symmetrical, emotionless and without any imperfections. Clothed in plain robes the colour of a dust covered page these ‘wrong things’ watch you in a manner that makes you feel like nothing but a piece of grit stuck in the teeth of an otherwise perfect machine.* 

Auditors are one of my favourite concepts from Pratchett’s works and I think the way they are portrayed in the Thief of Time is a wonderfully threatening concept. The auditors here are heavily edited from the incarnate Auditors of the book. They aren’t weak to chocolate for instance but they retain the essence of what made them dangerous.

Found in groups of three and ideally in a group of nine which is three threes these monsters rapidly go from next to useless to very dangerous. So when using them make it clear they are learning. As a DM build time into the game for this knowledge to spread and make it feasible that each new group has the information needed

This makes for more interesting battles as goal of the combat goes from ‘kill the guys next to us’ to ‘let’s make sure that none escape’ it also adds more thought to how the murder is dished out. It can also add to the strategy of the fight as the players know what skills might be used against them in future battles.

As a DM you have to be ready for these Auditors to pick up weapons and adapt. Allowing them to use new items and fully access the abilities they’ve been offered. My advice is to work this out before the game and make some notes so you don’t have to pause to look up what damage a spell or weapon does.

&amp;#x200B;",1,A thief of time encounter and Auditor monster
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,36,397,"I like to shake up my games and experiences. At my 0 sessions I like to get to know my player's characters or their blueprints to build one. One thing I like to do differently, something I incorporate from the man who taught me how to play, is the addition of what he called ""avatar powers."" 

My first DM was what you would consider that older, quintessential D&amp;D player/DM, having started with AD&amp;D in his college years back in the 80s. If you watch an older movie or show with the neon glitz, the Duran Duran soundtrack in the back, Wargames playing on a CRT tv, with people playing the old tabletop version of D&amp;D on graphing paper in a dorm or basement... that was him. He was a dinosaur and I've adopted his style in some ways, keeping with paper, pencils, handmade (poor quality) props and scrolls, and the idea of my players feeling ""heroic."" This doesn't have to mean they're all white knights and heart of gold rogues but that they are special, powerful, and most of all, *important*.

His reasoning for the added player abilities was that when you read older fantasy literature like ""The Simarillion"" or watched movies like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" you saw the villain being opposed by one lone hero in a desperate and skillful battle. Or, likewise, Drizzt Do'Urden or Conan fight against impossible odds in a valiant struggle where normal people would be swept aside like leaves. These moments shouldn't be regulated to players bum rushing the BBEG or cheesing mechanics (though sometimes that's even more fun) but instead highlight a single player in the moment. This gives the player of that session a particular investment, especially if they've interacted with the villain beforehand, perhaps even becoming something of a rival. Imagine a single player fighting against an insanely powerful enemy with new powers and strengths (temporary though they may be) to even the playing field while the rest of the party accomplishes the time sensitive objective. I feel that these options give a great opportunity to spice game play and story up in a way that really no other mechanic so far can.

First, I get to know my player's character. I like to sit down with them, alone, and discuss their history, their ideals, bonds, flaws, and goals. Many of my characters are new to the game, so I help guide them as much as I can. I ask them, ""who have you read about or watched in a show that you feel resonates with you?"" I use that as a rubric to build their character while trying to stay original and unique. Then I give the idea that I want them to build an avatar power. I tell them the idea of the mechanics and how I want it to tie into their character. To me, it's another way a player can personalize, customize, and invest into their character to make it really feel like their own. Lastly, I ask them to keep their new abilities secret until I reveal it in the game.

Then I use that power as an equalizer. I'm sure we've all had times when we've planned this great encounter that we feel will challenge the players but seem fair; a great time they will be sure to remember! Then the dice just roll against them at every turn, no one can land a hit or make a save, and even the low level fodder is crushing the players into the dirt. The avatar power is perfect for these moments. Used like a defense mechanism, players who are down can take a moment to try and save themselves and those who are wounded can fall back tactically. Nothing changes things in a battle like when the tiefling sorcerer rises up from an unconscious state, starts exuding an aura of shimmering heat and power like Naruto Uzumaki when he tapped into the demon fox, and starts throwing customized spells that I've created for him to use in this form. When the dust settles the enemies are dead or routed, the remaining players are licking their wounds or trying to stabilize their fallen companions, and the sorcerer descends from levitating five feet from the ground to pass out from exhaustion, saving the party with awe and fear in equal parts.

&amp;#x200B;

""What the hell happened? Why did he start melting the stones and throwing knives made of crystal?! HOW CAN HE DO THAT?"" No one else in the party knew he could do that. Now they have something to talk about when they limp back to their camp and everyone has something to consider.

Admittedly, this is not applicable to every kind of game and group. Some might see this as an easy mode or safety net for several reasons. Some DMs are starting to adopt a ""Dark Souls"" like mentality of gameplay. 

[DMs Now A Day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFFo7xz69t0)

And that's fine! I, however, like to give my players a lot of options. I also very much play a Gygax like style. ""Are you sure about that course of action?"" I say through narrowed, cautious eyes. If my players die I want it to be apparent they either failed on their part or they went out swinging like champions. And if they do go down, players will be talking about their noble sacrifice, icons and heroes that will be spoken of for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know, fellow DMs if you like the idea that my mentor has put forth and if you'd like examples and character histories. I'd be happy to provide them. My first character died nobly, fighting a terrible adult dragon with his avatar power, taking his opponent with him in an explosion that rocked the mountain chains to their foundations.

When it comes to world-building there are some really useful guidelines out there to help DMs create settlements, societies and governments. In fact, one of the most useful can be found in the first chapter of the DMG 5e, which describes the attributes of settlements of various sizes and different forms of government. This article on medieval demographics is also often cited in these sorts of discussions: https://gamingballistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medieval-Demographics-Made-Easy-1.pdf. However, both of these sources assume that the people you meet and the sites you visit exist within state societies. There is little mention of how non-state societies are organized. 

What follows will allow you to better model non-state societies in your settings, including those of savage humanoids and other social creatures. To do so, I want to briefly define social complexity, which is a concept used in anthropology to categorize a society according to the number of parts it contains and the degree of connectivity between those parts. Generally speaking, social complexity is positively correlated with changes in economic organization, inequality, population size, and the ability of leaders to exercise coercive force. There are a few different frameworks which have been proposed to capture social complexity; however, the one that I will be laying out here was produced by Morton Fried. It consists of the following ordinal levels of complexity: egalitarian, ranked, stratified, and state.

**Egalitarian**

The lowest level on the complexity ladder is the egalitarian society. In your game, these societies might be represented by bands of hunter-gatherers, halfling villages, or druidic enclaves. Egalitarian societies tend to be small (under 150 individuals) with little differentiation between members. This is not to say that everyone is perfectly equal. Rather, status tends to be based on factors like skill or age and is typically not hereditary. Economic activity is organized at the level of the household, and each family unit is largely self-sufficient. Craft specialization is limited, and your players will not find shops or factories, or even people who are able to devote all their time to a single craft. Almost everyone is involved in the acquisition or processing of food in some way. Exchange between members is governed by the principle of reciprocity, characterized by the giving of gifts. Your players may be able to exchange goods but their coinage will likely not be accepted - they will need to put up something of intrinsic value.

**Ranked**

The next level up in the ranked society. In ranked societies, there is evidence of incipient hierarchy and status differences between members. However, status continues to be based on simple, sometimes arbitrary criteria such as age or birth order. While there are status differences, these differences do not afford high status individuals with privileged access to resources. In fact, leaders within ranked societies commonly function to redistribute resources. Although, they might organize economic activity, they are expected to share the wealth evenly, and insure that everyone is cared for on a basic level. 

Ranked societies are also sometimes called ""Big Man"" societies because of the way that leaders acquire and maintain power and the forms of influence they are able to exert. Leaders in big man societies occupy their position because of their persuasive ability, skill, and wisdom. They do not have the ability to coerce members under threat of force and instead must, cajole, convince and lead by example. This is the level of complexity that most savage humanoids such as orcs and goblins seem to cap out at. For instance, orc leaders rule on the basis of their abilities, namely their strength. They don't inherit their power and they are subject to losing their status if they fail.  They also don't have much ability to monopolize resources to any significant extent.

**Stratified**

Stratified societies are more complex than hierarchical and ranked societies without being full-blown states. A key distinguisher that sets stratified societies apart from ranked and egalitarian societies is that leaders are almost always hereditary. What is more, leaders and other elites have privileged access to resources and experience a standard of living that may far surpass that of the common people. Elites may also have the ability to coerce action from lower status individuals, demanding service rather than soliciting it. Finally, stratified societies commonly feature a level of economic specialization. It will be possible for your players to encounter merchants and skilled trades people willing to do business. Some might be willing to exchange coin, but the majority would still rather barter and trade for commodities. Even so, the quality of items for sale is close to rivaling what they might find in a state society. 

A nice example of a stratified society in D&amp;D is Hobgoblin society. In particular, their leaders have coercive power over their followers and don't need to lead by example in the same way as the leaders of ranked societies need to. The Drow might also be considered a stratified society. Elite status amongst the Drow is hereditary, and related to family membership. Drow elites also clearly have a much higher standard of living than non-elites in their societies, reflecting their ability to monopolize wealth. The only thing missing from Drow society that would qualify them for state-hood is the existence of a bureaucracy.  We don't hear anything about Drow tax collector or census takers; although it's certainly possible that writers on the Drow found these topics too mundane to mention! 

**States**

Chances are, if you are reading this, you live in a state society. State societies are the most complex on Fried's scale, and as such tend to be the most populous, hierarchical and unequal. They share many aspects in common with stratified societies, but the defining feature of states that sets them apart is the existence of a bureaucracy. Most ancient states in human history were autocratic with a single powerful ruler. However, state level complexity is too much for a single ruler to effectively handle, with hundreds of thousands of subjects to manage, alliances and trade to negotiate, war to wage, and taxes to collect. As a result, autocratic heads of state are supported in these tasks by an elite group of individuals for whom it falls the nuts and bolts tasks of administering the state. These people may be appointed by the ruler or may hold their position by virtue of their own power independent from the ruler. A diagnostic trait of a state society is the existence of a literate scribal class. A class of people devoted to producing and keeping records. 

**TL;DR**

The concept of social complexity gives anthropologists (and DMs) a useful framework for understanding how state societies and non-state societies are organized. In the context of D&amp;D, the notion of social complexity can help DMs to model the behaviour of different societies and create believable organizations and events. Although there are always exceptions, most societies fall within the categories espoused by Martin Fried, who observed that as societies become larger and more complex they also become more specialized and unequal.

*""These devices are relatively similar in nature, but vary in appearance and effect. Wands are the smallest of these, usually being about 1 ft long and narrow. Rods are the next largest, about 3 ft long and 3⁄4 in thick. Staves are the largest, usually being 6 ft long and about 2 in thick... Any staff will be made of wood, unless otherwise noted, with ornate carving and complex shape. Most of these devices use charges... Should a device reach zero charges, it will disintegrate, thus rendering recharging impossible.""*



Each week we are doing a different theme for the treasure.

The weekly themes are as follows.

The goal of this month is to ~~give me a list of unique magical treasures that I can give my players~~ expand upon the list of treasures that any DM can pull from, so don't just copy or reskin stuff out of  the treasure section of the DMG.

Treasure should be ""balanced"" in terms of 5e... Wether or not your item is ""balanced"" in terms of too much/not enough damage is not for us to judge here. Just make sure your item is in 5e terms.



I am currently collecting all of these treasures into a documents that anyone may access. I will make this document available at the end of the month.

Natural doesn't have to be good or bad, it may not be a net positive, but provides a necessary bonus. I have tried to concoct something for every role, but I'm sure I've missed something.

I find exhaustion is a bit under used, so to have a bit of fun with my players resource economy I gave each single use item a drawback of one level of exhaustion after end of effect. It may seem harsh, but bear in mind what these items are doing, and more importantly are NOT doing. They are redirecting energy within a closed system(adventurer). They are not introducing outside energy (magic) into that system. The cost of 'overclocking' that system for the desired effect? One exhaustion, please.

(ante imperium), but the nature of the plane wasn't understood until some time between the third and fifth century P.C. (post cataclysmus), when it was discovered to be an inner plane of both Ignean and Auran energy, as opposed to merely a way to summon deadly firestorms.

In-depth research and expedition into the plane was initially extraordinarily rare, if extant beyond a few isolationist archwizard's laboratories, as total immunity to fire was necessary to enter the plane beyond a rudimentary level. Eventually, however, when [Helm](http://miniworld.com/adnd/spelljammer/reigar-lifeboat-by-a-semushina.png) technology was discovered and made widespread less than a century ago, exploration boomed. However, fully exploring the plane beyond a superficial level is still extremely difficult, dangerous, and expensive.

Someone clever or with good connections would be able to befriend, hire, or trick some other creature, like an eldjotun or an azer into going in, but even they couldn't stay for very long because of all the smoke stop you from breathing! You had to be deliberate, had to plan encounters very carefully, and be an absolute master Conjurer of portals to set down exactly where you needed to be for the few minutes you had. Nowadays everybody has those fancy plane-ships, and they've got elementals in their armor, it saps all the strategy and skill out of it. Anybody who can hire a mage can galavant around the conflagration until their hearts give out, where's the craftsmanship in exploration anymore?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-* Daevos, Arborean Royal Conjurer.

There are two fundamental obstacles to exploration in the plane of smoke: it's similarity to the plane of fire, and its similarity to the plane of air.

&amp;#x200B;

Early on in our understanding of the world, portals to the plane of smoke were usually conflated with portals to the Elemental Chaos of Fire- the realm beyond the more grounded areas of the plane of fire where that destructive element storms around infinitely. And like that plane, total fire immunity is necessary to survive on the plane for any length of time.

Traditionally, the most common way to obtain this (for those who do not already have it, of course) was magical armor. The plane of fire (and the environmentally similar Muspelheim in Ysgard) has a noticeably high portion of prominent smithing species- armor built by the [Efreeti](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/7/204/1000/1000/636284730637980614.jpeg), the [Fire Giants](https://img00.deviantart.net/963b/i/2009/351/c/f/fire_giant_armors_by_brenze.jpg), and the [Azers](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/monsterhunter/images/4/4f/Guran_armor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121211101142) all convey immunity to the fiery elements to whoever wears them. If you can find [free Azers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/35ok4e/azer/), befriending them is the best way to have a suit crafted for yourself; the fire giants, and especially the Efreeti, are extremely hostile to most outsiders and working with them is dangerous. Failing that, you may find or acquire a magical ring from a grand wizard to the same effect, but this will be expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one largest commonality between the plane of air, and the plane of smoke: neither have ground. Both planes are spatially infinite, and that means a vast sea of air, with the potential to fall indefinitely. The Great Conflagration does have far more land masses than the plane of air (which has virtually zero), but one still must be able to fly on one's own power in order to make any progress here. There are a myriad of magical items, of varying rarities and difficulties in obtaining, which could supplement this weakness; brooms of flying, wings of flying, and boots of flying are all somewhat straightforward. It is strongly recommended that you do not rely on the magical spell ""fly;"" while this is a reasonable temporary fix, its reliance on the spellcaster's ability to concentrate in such a hostile plane, and its temporary nature, make mistakes inevitable. Smaller groups have been known to rely on a few members capable of naturally flying to carry the rest; this is perfectly feasible, but far from ideal, especially for longer trips.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the plane introduces one major obstacle of its own: the inability to breathe. The air here is filled with soot and smoke, hence the name; while this isn't always visible outside some darker realms, even the fire-immune will eventually suffocate with prolonged exposure to the air, and may face serious long-term health problems decades after their excursions. For centuries, this was solved with a simple cloth over the face, thin enough to let air through without letting the particles in it; this works for short times, but it isn't perfect; the longer you intend on staying, the more likely it is the cloth will simply fall, burn, or be lost, and even if all goes perfectly, it will not be enough for multiple day adventures. Some, such as the children of Djinni, do not need to breathe and will not have issue with this. Most, however, must find such magical items commissioned specifically for this purpose; globes of air, or items based off the magic of rings of swimming and caps of water breathing which can expand those features into not breathing at all.

Even with all of these issues addressed fully, which is absolutely imperative in order to explore the plane, the nature of the conflagration makes it extremely difficult to see further than ten to thirty feet, depending on the weather. One must move cautiously and slowly to better avoid barely-hidden threats.

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you reading this in more primitive realms, that's the end of the story. It's basically impossible to explore here, barring extreme preparation, extenuating circumstances, or excellent cleverness.

However, less than a century ago, explorers began using planeships to explore. [Planeships](http://www.enworld.org/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=70271&amp;d=1442430105) work via Helms installed in their systems, which allow an arcane spellcaster to pilot the ship through the air. These Helms are powered by **wonderstone**, some of the most potent soul-binding material possible. Traditionally, astral elementals are bound to massive chunks of wonderstone to allow the planeship to travel through planes. Air elemental souls are also commonly bound to ships, which allow them to create and maintain a bubble of air around the ship up to a certain amount of feet. In the plane of Smoke, this bubble keeps out the soot and the flame, and allows indefinite exploration as long as food supplies last. However, this exploration must be from outside the ship, and the above methods must still be used to investigate findings in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

# Locals and Locales

Despite the seemingly inhospitable environment, there are three notable population centers on the plane of Smoke. In fact, if one looks closely, one will see that the plane is filled with life- though perhaps not in the way we expect to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

Called **Al-Dakhan** by its ignean inhabitants, and Eshn by the auran peoples, the [Realm of Smoke](https://68.media.tumblr.com/1847fa70987d1332d95cd4b0a9169c6f/tumblr_inline_mpvbohHsFz1qz4rgp.jpg) is a significant expanse of darker flame and dirtier air within the Conflagration. The realmspace is weak here, which manifests as networks of temporary portals opening up to the quasi-elemental planes of Vacuum and Soot, allowing negative air and negative fire to seep in. As a result, it's harder to breathe, and harder to see. Many fools come here expecting a respite- an area with influence of negative energy will be less harsh, both in air and in fire, but the winds blow harder here than anywhere, rushing to the portals, and the bits of soot are as hot as the fire beside it.

&gt;*And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last, for the ruler of this Smoken land*  
&gt;  
&gt;*is a fearsome* ***lich****,* *with a huge, ashen keep- at least, that's what I have come to understand.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And I've also heard it told, that he's something to behold! Like a genie-* ***huge*** *and* ***red***  
&gt;  
&gt;*and sets out to slay with his undead horde,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*each with flaming fist, or with smoking sword!- that is, so I've heard it said.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And with that elemental fright, in that sweltering light,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*he flies into the soot, like a wojek in the sky!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And they call him:* ***Sultan-Lich***

The above in an excerpt from ""Where the Shadows Creep In,"" Jack (of the Lantern)'s recount of places in the multiverse where negative energy mingles with some other kind of magical energy. He's referencing the **Smoke Palace**, where the lich-Sultan of the Efreeti, enemy to the City of Brass, makes keep in the Realm of Smoke; his undead are fused with souls of elemental fire, giving them strange burnings and powers. Several of these undead roam the Realm of Smoke freely now, and passive magic from the Sultan's experiments have caused air elemental souls to latch on to certain undead in a similar way, creating its own unique obstacles.

This is also the most common place to find one of the most infamous [smoke elementals](http://t15.deviantart.net/SvqSScfZeXqZnX5q5_V8WmnIajA=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre08/15ca/th/pre/f/2012/219/6/6/belker_by_watjong-d5a6pbx.jpg), the [Belker](http://kaluta.com/pages/games/dnd/belker10.jpg). 

[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/belker.htm](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/belker.htm)

These elemental spirits can be found all around the Great Conflagration, but are most common in the Realm of smoke. They occupy only a semi-solid form, with the ability to complete transform into smoke. Some horror stories tell of belkers diving into the lungs of a target and solidifying, brutally destroying its victim. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Alriyah-Nar,** or Alruwh for our auran friends, is known as the [Whirling Realm](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/328/32888.ngsversion.1421959870103.jpg), and is the portion of the Great Conflagration cosmically nearest the pure Elemental Plane of Air. The fire here eases up considerably, although you will still need full immunity to stay for long, and breathing is noticeably less harmful (though still strongly recommended against if possible- elsewhere in the plane may be akin to constantly smoking a cigar, while the Whirling Realm may be more akin to 2-3 cigarettes in a day).

The winds here are very strong, creating powerful tunnels and currents capable of lifting most humanoids off the ground (and the strongest capable of lifting some giants!). This is both a boon and a detriment. The nature of this plane means that losing your magical flight will be less punishing; you will not fall to your death, nor will you fall forever. You will most likely be brought to a nearby land mass or keep, or at worst will eventually be carried to one of the bordering pure elemental planes. However, this means that even *with* your flight abilities, it will be difficult (if possible) to control your movement against the winds, and you may be caught in a fire tornado for quite some time, or be carried off to a bordering plane regardless of your preparation. It's important to keep in mind that while there is a stronger presence of elemental air here, there is no less elemental fire, and vision will still be obscured by the red smoke while the current carries you at high speeds. Physical protection strongly recommended.

The Whirling Realm is said to contain the hut of one **Hawa Hayya,** a small vaguely human-like being of primordial fire, taking the appearance of a kindly grandmother of whatever race or species finds her;c 0; . There have been no *confirmed* encounters with Hawa Hayya, but she features prominently in aarokocran, firenewt, and genasi writings and stories across the elemental planes of fire and air. Her house is said to be warded against the smoke in much the same way a planeship is, but to nearly one hundred feet out, and it sits on an acre-large earthberg where she grows waving grains and exotic vegetables for weary travelers she finds. One Victor Coalsmile, paladin of the sea goddess Ceto, claims to have received his Volcanic Arm as a boon from Hawa Hayya after she looked into his future, on behalf of Pelor, god of light and the sun, as evidence of his right to rule and the backing of two different gods on his side. This report is of extremely questionable accuracy, but it not the only story of a gift from Hawa Hayya, if she really exists.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lahab-Kabir,** known to the aurans as Gdola, is the Realm of Great Flame. This realm makes up the popular image of ""The Great Conflagration,"" with massive storms of fire and flame searing at the skin, intermingled with embers and smoke.

&gt;*A candle's wick, it has a life about it. Now, maybe not a life like you and me, but somewhere there's a single streak of soul inside it, waiting for the right time to be seen.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Dicken Gringleglitter, gnomish gardener for Aganazzar's Fiery Keep

The Realm of Great Flame is most emblematic of a strong truth about the Plane of Smoke: there is life everywhere. To an untrained eye, nothing lives here at all; there are no structures or buildings, you cannot hear any language or struggle, what little land floats in the currents here is barren and scorched firerack, and there seem to be no wandering creatures here. This first glance is deceiving. In reality, one can hardly move ten feet in Gdola without unknowingly passing through some fire elemental that makes up part of the flame. Storms here are filled with magmins and mephits as material storms can be filled with swarms of insects. If one can call out in primordial, a nearby living creature will certainly be able to hear you, so explorers here must be equipped to deal with powerful elementals in addition to the heat. Many fire elementals pose no threat to you if you come properly equipped against fire, but keep their presence in mind as you sail.

&amp;#x200B;",1,"The Para-elemental Plane of Smoke, or ""The Great Conflagration"""
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,55,516,"Up next in the Deep Dive series, we are going to take a break from the spells and move into the realm of character classes. The best place to start is the Barbarian, which, is a heavy damage focused class, and has continued that tradition up to and including 5e.  So let’s take a look at the men in loincloths, the Barbarian.

The Barbarian was introduced in Unearthed Arcana for AD&amp;D in 1985. A subclass of the Fighter, the Barbarian quickly became the go to “hit things” class in the game.  As they progressed through the editions, the class quickly became a fan favorite in the Fighter class (replacing the Paladin, who, while they got spells, does a great deal less damage than the Barbarian). Some of the more important key stats for the Barbarian class by edition are listed below. Please note that some of the editions have a ridiculous amount of information on the Barbarian class - looking at you 2e - so we are only hitting on some of the information we felt was most important. If you feel like we are missing a key piece of knowledge or have a delightful story of being in a loincloth, please let us know in the comments below!

&amp;nbsp;

**AD&amp;D Barbarian**

*Key Features*

* HP Die: d12 through 8th level, then 4 HP per level
* Saving Throw Bonuses: +4 to poison; +3 to paralysis, death magic, petrifaction and polymorphism; +2 to rod, staff, and breath weapon attacks.
* Must be Human, can be any non-lawful Alignment
* Hatred of magic, including magic items and magic users
* Can hit creatures immune to non-magical attacks starting at 4th level
* Summon the Barbarian Horde at 8th level

The first incarnation of the Barbarian felt more like a combination of Tarzan and a Viking. They were skilled in running, jumping, climbing and a whole bunch of other skills that were extremely helpful in an unforgiving wilderness. But they were also tough and hardy warriors, many times wielding a shield and an axe, with animal skins for armor.  This combination of skills made them incredibly powerful in outdoor surroundings, but less so in dungeon and city settings.


The hatred of magic in AD&amp;D puts them at a grave disadvantage in the early levels.  They refuse to use magical weapons or armor, and will go out of their way to destroy any magical items they may find in their early adventures. Of course, this is immediately watered down starting at 3rd level, where they can start using potions, and at 4th level where they can use magic weapons. They still dislike like magic users with the passion of a thousand burning suns, but it seems like such a waste to take such an interesting disadvantage, and eliminate it right away.

Going further, this hatred of magic puts them at odds with magic users of all types and makes for an interesting party dichotomy. While Clerics aren’t hated as much, they are still viewed with suspicion. What we also found interesting is that for a class that hates magic so intensely, they are given the ability to detect illusions and magic starting at first level. It seems odd that a class that shuns magic, and therefore knows very little about it, would have a 25% chance at 1st level to be able to detect magic, but I suppose it helps them track down those artifacts to destroy. 

And finally, we reach the Barbarian Horde, an insanely OP ability the Barbarian gains at 8th level. If the Barbarian is in their natural terrain, they can summon a horde of Barbarians numbering the Barbarian experience-point total divided by 1000. So at 8th level the Barbarian can summon 275 of his comrades to assist in any number of ways. While it takes a week for the horde to arrive, and they will only follow a very specific set of directions, imagine having a small army of 500 Barbarians, when you are only 9th level no less, helping you storm the walls of a castle for a number of weeks equal to your level! (To be fair though, level 9 is a MASSIVE achievement in AD&amp;D and other Fighters were getting castles at this point.)

&amp;nbsp;

**2e Barbarian**

Before we dive into the 2e version, let us say that TSR went full blown into the money making business.  There are handbooks for every character class (including the Ninja, which I totally forgot about and will be getting soon) and the Barbarian is no exception.  At 134 pages, the information can become overwhelming.  I’ve been struggling to plod through, and I can tell you it’s been painful at times. I now see that the layout of D&amp;D hardcovers has always been horrible, whether by TSR or WotC. Why do I find the spell progression chart three pages after we talked about spells for the shaman, and are now in the subsection of Homeland terrain? Please, please, please hire a halfway decent editor WotC.

There is no way we can hit everything here, but hopefully we can hit upon the highlights. It was a difficult decision to decide on what to put in and what to leave out. 

*Key Features*

* HP Die: 1d12 through 8th level, then 3 HP per level
* Addition of Shaman subclass
* Fighter/Cleric Kits

So while there is a TON more information available now, we are going to focus on a few main things - the Shaman, Homeland Terrain, and the Fighter/Cleric Kits.  There is just too much information to discuss (unless we wanted the article to also be 134 pages long) and these are probably the two biggest additions to the class.


But before we dive in, I wanted to point out one interesting change from AD&amp;D to 2e. Barbarians can now be lawful.  I think this is an underrated, but necessary and important change for the class.  Yes, when I normally think of a Barbarian, I think Chaotic.  But Barbarians have a very strict class structure within the horde, so lawful makes a lot of sense as an alignment option. 

Now, onto the meat of the 2e Barbarian.

&amp;nbsp;

*Shaman*

The shaman is a combo spellcaster/fighter. He starts with 1d10 hit die. He’s basically a Barbarian lite and a pretty damn good spellcaster.  They also have the same access to Barbarian armor and weapons.  Again, a pretty good spellcaster that can take a punch.

How and what spells the Shaman gets is simplistic and slightly confusing.  There are only a couple of small paragraphs that describe what spells the Shaman gets and how they get them. The first paragraph describes how a Shaman gets access to their spells.

&gt; ”Shamans have access to a limited number of spheres. If the DM allows a shaman to worship a specific mythos, additional sphere limitations may apply. A nature deity, for instance, may allow major access only to the animal and plant spheres. Some deities may allow spells normally denied to shamans; a fire deity might give major access to the sun and elemental spheres but deny access to the charm and necromantic spheres.”

Major access means that they can cast all levels of spells of that sphere, while minor means they can only access the 1st through 3rd level spells of that sphere.  I assume it is up to the DM to decide what access the Shaman has, based on what deity they choose.  This requires the Shaman and the DM to have an intimate knowledge of the deities, something that wasn’t as prevalent in old school D&amp;D.  Maybe it was just me and my friends, but the Gods were something we gave very little thought too.  Sure, they released a Deities and Demigods book for AD&amp;D, but I didn’t know that many people who actually used it. So based on what deity the Shaman chooses, the access to spells was listed as follows:

&gt;*Major access:* All, animal, combat, divination, healing, plant.

&gt;*Minor access:* Charm, elemental, necromantic, protection, sun, weather.

&gt;*No access:* Astral, creation, guardian, summoning.

Once again, the wording of this list is a bit confusing. When they say Major Access to All, they don’t mean they get access to ALL spells, but rather a set of utility spells that ALL Clerics/Shamans get access too. Yea, it’s a bit stupid the way it’s worded. The No Access list is interesting, and I agree wholeheartedly with not allowing astral spells, since the backwater shaman would have little to no idea of the astral plane.  Lastly, Shamans cannot use scrolls, since they cannot read or write because… of course they’re illiterate… I guess?

Shamans also have the ability to turn undead.  They are not as adept at doing so as the Cleric, being able to turn undead at two levels less than the Cleric can.  This seems weird to me for some reason, I have to wonder how much exposure the Shaman would have to undead in certain terrains, and feels a bit off to me. All Shamans must use their talismans to turn undead, much like a Cleric uses his holy symbol. But here’s what gets me when looking at the Barbarian guide for 2e. Where spells for the Shaman get a couple paragraphs that leave you wondering, the talisman gets over a page of information.  It goes into some detail about what the talisman can be and what happens if they lose it.  I don’t remember seeing anything about the Cleric losing his holy symbol in any of the editions and it makes me think that the writers really think that people who play Barbarians are complete morons.

*Fighter/Cleric Kits*

Kits are the first foray into both backstory and class archetypes. Each Barbarian picks a kit, either a Fighter or Cleric kit, during the character creation process and it determines a wide variety of skills and proficiencies available to the specific kits. Below is a list of what a Barbarian Kit consists of:

&gt;Description  - Appearance

&gt;Requirements - Ability scores needed for the kit

&gt;Homeland Terrain - Where they live 

&gt;Role - Barbarian belief system

&gt;Secondary Skills - Specific skills the barbarian may or may not have

&gt;Weapon Proficiencies - Weapons they can use. Some kits have a required weapon

&gt;Wealth Options - Player’s starting funds

&gt;Armor and Equipment  - The starting weapon and armor the barbarian starts with for free

&gt;Special Benefits - Advantages specific to the kits chosen

&gt;Special Hindrances - Disadvantages specific to the kits chosen

&gt;Spheres (Clerics only) - Spell types the cleric has access to 

&gt;Talisman (Clerics only) - suggested type of talisman 

&gt;*Note - Where it says Clerics only, it is referring to the fact that they also include reflavoring for Clerics to be Barbarian-like or from a Barbarian society. They make a note that Wizards are too sophisticated to be a Barbarian, and Rogues can only be from the city.*

This is nothing mind blowing for those that have only played 5e, but when it came out, it added a whole new dimension to characters.  A character now had a story before they started playing.  The kits also introduced the idea of what we now call archetypes.  Previously, subclasses were actually just classes of their own, such as Fighter subclasses were Ranger and Paladin, but they were, for all intents and purposes, their own unique class. These kits provided flavor to the Fighter/Cleric class in the form of choosing a Barbarian Kit.

Below is a list of all the Kits.  The ones we found most interesting also have an edited description of them, and you can find the full descriptions of all the kits in the 2nd Edition The Complete Barbarian's Handbook. There is no way to go into much depth on each kit, but this brief synopsis will hopefully help you understand what color each one brings to the game.

* ***Brushrunner (Fighter)*** - Nearly naked running through fields Barbarians.
* ***Brute (Fighter)*** - Caveman Barbarians.
* ***Forest Lord (Fighter)*** - The Ranger Barbarians.
* ***Islander (Fighter)*** - Jamaican Barbarians.
* ***Plainsrider (Fighter)*** - Think Githyanki Barbarians.
* ***Dreamwalker (Cleric)*** - Dropping peyote with your spirit animal Barbarians.
* ***Flamespeaker (Cleric)*** - Pyromaniac Barbarians.
* ***Seer (Cleric)*** - Arrogant Fortune Teller Barbarians.
* ***Spiritist (Cleric)*** - I’d rather be a Druid Barbarians.
* ***Witchman (Cleric)*** - I see ghosts Barbarians.

***Ravager (Fighter)***
&gt;*The Ultimate Raging Barbarians.*

&gt;Culled from the strongest and most bloodthirsty members of their tribes, Ravagers serve as bodyguards and manhunters, trained to kill with weapons as well as their bare hands. So violent is their reputation, Ravagers are even feared by their fellow tribesmen, who consider them unpredictable and perhaps mentally unbalanced. . . A strong sense of pride is perhaps their biggest flaw; he who insults or offends a Ravager may pay with his blood, if not his life. In many barbarian societies, Ravagers are considered the personal property of the leaders. They are bound to obey the leader’s every command and may even be traded to other tribes. Ravagers often resist such servitude, abandoning their homelands for the life of a nomad. . . He is contemptuous of civilization and has no patience for intellectuals. He considers hygiene the province of the weak; he takes pride in his mud-caked skin, his filthy loincloth, and his greasy hair. . . The Ravager’s mood swings are dram’s a list of all atic, even frightening. One moment, he may return a wounded bird to its nest; the next, he may fly into a rage because he has misplaced his axe. He smashes trees with his fists and screams at the top of his lungs, then dissolve into laughter if a companion trips and falls.

***Wizard Slayer (Fighter)***
&gt;*Magic is the worst Barbarians.*

&gt;The Wizard Slayer has few interests aside from destroying evil magic. He cooperates with his companions as circumstances dictate, but he is always seeking evil practitioners of magic. . . Grim and brooding, he may go for days without saying a word, brightening only at the prospect of encountering one of his hated foes. Wary of all forms of outworld magic, he avoids associating with the magic-wielding members of his party unless forced by circumstance.

***Medicine Man/Woman (Cleric)***
&gt;*The healer, spiritual advisor and teacher of the tribe Barbarians.*

&gt;The Medicine Man assumes the role of caretaker for any group with whom he aligns. He gathers healing herbs for the wounded, stays up through the night with the sick, and presides over funeral rites for the dead. While the concerns of outworld companions may be beyond his understanding, he is quick to lend a sympathetic ear. Despite his crude manner, many find his mere presence a source of comfort. The Medicine Man is unusually reflective for a barbarian, spending hours brooding over the cruelty of life or his failure to heal to someone in his care. On the battlefield, he fights fiercely and selflessly, risking his life to aid endangered companions.

2e really helped redefine a Barbarian and focused on where they came from as opposed to just being a class and abilities. It’s also fascinating how you could pick up being a Shaman, Fighter or a Cleric Barbarian… which is a weird thing to think about.

**3.5e Barbarian**

Thanks to whatever god you pray to… I prefer Tempus, after the insanity that was the 2e Barbarian, 3.5e returns to its senses and gives a complete class description in under 3 pages.  Added to that is the fact that there have been some additions to the class that take the class to another level. The rage mechanic once again pushes the Barbarian into OP territory, lest we thought he was slipping in ferocity.

*Key Features*

* Hit Dice: 12 + Con Modifier at first level, d12 + Con Modifier every level
* Fast Movement
* Rage Mechanics
* Illiteracy

First and foremost, the Barbarian is no longer allowed to be of Lawful alignment. Sigh. This won’t be the last time they change this rule, and it does get tiresome after a while. I’ve argued why I think the lawful alignment works in 2e.  Though there is an interesting little tidbit added to the last paragraph on alignment for the Barbarian. It states that any Barbarian that becomes Lawful loses their ability to rage, and then becomes an Ex-Barbarian. Pretty stiff penalty, but they do get to keep all their other abilities. That said, Chaotic still makes the most sense for a Barbarian.

Fast Movement is an interesting ability added to the Barbarian, but it does get bogged down in the rules that come along with it. The 3.5 PHB describes the fast movement skill as such:

A barbarian’s land speed is fast than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. For example, a human barbarian has a speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet. A halfling barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.

Keeping track of this may seem easier in the time of D&amp;D Beyond, but back when 3.5e was released, it was a bit more difficult. Sure, what armor you were wearing is easy enough to track. But weight load is an entirely different beast. It was rare that someone wrote down the weight of every single item they had in their backpack, and even if they did, then they’d have to track additions and subtraction for items to see how if that changed the weight load. It’s not as easy as it sounds, trust me.  Also, can you picture a halfling barbarian? They sound adorable.

The big add in 3.5e was the addition of the Rage mechanic. Now, the Barbarian could become even more powerful in battle. Rage increased the Barbarian’s Strength by 4, Constitution by 4, +2 to Will saves (Wisdom save), but reduces their AC by 2. The Con increase is pretty nice, since it increases the Barbarian’s hit points by 2 per level. These are not temporary HP either.  For as long as the rage lasts, the hit points are treated like normal HP. Speaking of length, the rage lasts for 3 rounds plus their con modifier. The Barbarian can use his rage only once per encounter, and can only use it once a day until 4th level.  At 4th and every other four levels after, the barbarian gains the ability to use rage one more time per day. He can end the rage before the encounter ends, but the penalty is pretty stiff if you are still in battle; -2 to Str and Dex and can’t charge or run. 

The improvements to the Barbarian in 3.5e vastly improve the Barbarian from the previous editions.  Rage is a huge addition to the class, and really helps shape the Barbarian through the next two editions. I also want to take this time to complain about how Barbarians can’t Read or Write unless you spend 2 skill points to give them literacy. Why do they think that every angry person with an axe can’t read? 

&amp;nbsp;

**4e Barbarian**

*Key Features*

* Hit Points: 15 + Con, gain an additional 6HP per level
* Rage Powers
* Huge variety of abilities

Oh 4e, the ill-favored middle child of DnD. While the system may be lambasted for being too video game-y, I enjoy how they went about creating unique powers for every class, and the Barbarian is no different, starting with the Rage powers. 

Rage, in the past edition, was a set effect that did a specific thing and maybe at higher levels got a little bit better, in 4e they introduce a wide variety of choices and flavor for your Rage. Starting at level 1, you got one use of your Daily Evocation (which is your Rage) and you had four different Evocations you could choose from to modify your Rage, this could be a flat bonus to your melee damage to temporary HP every time you hit to more movement every time you were raging, and your Rage lasted for the entire encounter or if you entered a new Rage. 

From 1st to 4th level you could Rage once a day, hence it being a Daily Evocation, starting at 5th level you got to choose another Daily Evocation, so you could now Rage twice a day, and these new 5th level Evocations had different effects like: make a secondary attack, regenerate HP every round, or deal lightning damage to everyone around you. Your rages were tied directly to the number of Daily Evocations you got and by Level 20 you had 4 uses of Rage a day and they all did something different! That’s pretty awesome and a lot better than just hitting things with the same mechanic over and over all day.

The other part of being a Barbarian in 4e meant you had a ton of options besides just raging and hitting things. You had different Daily and At-Will powers that you could use to help you in combat. These abilities were more than just you hit something and deal damage and was stuff like: bonuses to your initiative, regain Hit Points, allow enemies to hit you so that you get a bonus to your attack rolls and so much more. With all these different abilities that allow you to do more than just roll to hit for your action, it’s almost like you are a warrior wizard whose spells are different types of attacks. It’s a pretty exciting way to play a dude that hits things. 

One last point to make about the 4e Barbarian is that they have several paths they can take once they reach 11th Level, they can go the more stock path of a Barbarian or choose a weird Paragon Path that gave them different powers that they could use through a day. This helps add more flavor to their build, even if it does come a bit later in the game. Here are the four paths in the Player’s Handbook 2 for 4e:

* ***Bear Warrior*** - Become a literal bear Barbarians.
* ***Fearbringer Thane*** - All your enemies quake in fear Barbarians.
* ***Frenzied Berserker*** - Just keep hitting it until its dead Barbarians.
* ***Wildrunner*** - Speedy Barbarians.

&amp;nbsp;

**5e Barbarian**

*Key Features*

* Hit Dice: 12 + Con Modifier at first level, d12 + Con Modifier every level
* Rage
* Primal Path

5e has been universally acclaimed for going back to the basics for the grognard DnD players, combining a streamlined system with familiar mechanics from the past editions, and it seems like Barbarian takes a lot of inspiration from 3/3.5e of DnD. Not only does our Rage do a set mechanic, but we are back to Fast Movement(at 5th level), Unarmored Defense and being a simple “I hit things” class. I’ll be honest, it’s a bit of a let down compared to all the neat things you could pick and choose in 4e, but you do get more abilities in 5e than in 3.5e so that’s a win I suppose.

Let’s talk about Rage: it lasts a minute, which is different from other editions as 3.5 relied on your Con modifier to determine the duration, and 4e was the entire encounter. This is also the first time where your Rage can end early if you don’t get hurt and you don’t make an attack against a hostile creature in a turn. Also with Rage, you take half damage from Bludgeoning, Piercing &amp; Slashing damage, easily the three biggest damage types in 5e. That’s pretty awesome, and if that isn’t good enough for you, you also deal extra damage per attack! You truly are a murder-hobo when you go the Barbarian path.

After your Rage, the next thing you have to look forward to is your Primal Path you get to choose at 3rd level, this is a subclass/archetype for the Barbarian that allows you to add more flavor to them. In the PHB, you have two options: a Berserker or a Totem Warrior. The Berserker is more focused on dealing damage and ending combat quickly. They get an extra attack if they go into a Frenzy Rage and can use their mere presence to scare away creatures. The Berserker is a pretty straightforward class for those not wanting to get too far into mechanics. 

The Totem Warrior on the other hand really gives you the feel of a spiritual fighter. You have options at 3rd, 6th and 14th level to add to your Totem and gain abilities pertaining to that totem animal. This can be the Bear (3rd level) to give you resistance to all damage except psychic, a huge boon for those fighting more than just bandits, and at 14th level you can fly in short bursts as an Eagle totem! It’s pretty cool that you can mix and match Totem Spirit Animals and adds a bit of customization for you, though you only ever get 3 options per Totem Spirit in the PHB. 

All-in-all, the 5e Barbarian is a great class for dealing damage, and some might even say its OP when it comes to doing just that. Personally, I really like all the flavor you get out of a Barbarian in 2e and love all the options you get in 4e. The Barbarian has had an incredible transformation throughout the editions, starting as a Fighter option and eventually becoming its own class in 3e and continuing it’s non-stop fury into 5e. ",1,Let's take a look at the long history of the men in loincloths... the Barbarian!
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,43,"I started a Ravnica campaign with brand new players a few weeks ago and couldn't find any premade PCs like WotC has - so I made a bunch! Two PCs per guild. I made a hearty effort to primarily use races specific to this setting, and flavour their backgrounds according to their guild's values. Just as a heads-up: in making these, I dealt with a couple issues with the downloaded form-fillable .pdf's that may be worth noting:

- The fillable boxes do not show up on mobile devices. I don't know why. I tried re-uploading, different kinds of mobile devices, etc... but none of them like this format.

- A couple of the skills are joined (if you fill in one box, another will also fill in, ditto for the text boxes) in the Wisdom and Intelligence areas. To compensate, I either ticked off the box, or filled in the modifier to indicate that the skill has been selected. Missing information can be filled in with pencil after being printed out.

Anyways, I hope you guys get good use of these!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,28,122,"So hello fellow GMs. I'm a newbie GM and working on a simple add-on for the LMoP adventure I'm currently running with 2 different parties. This add-on will make the PCs want to explore a haunted keep on the western side of the Neverwinter Woods.

Given that it's at the base of the mountain, I added some mines that could be explored. And for the purpose of my campaign and with great influence from **Path of Exile Delve Mechanic** I created this.

Since I am a newbie, I cannot guarantee the balance, but I can say it will work for my parties. I will update it after your feedback, if need be.

The mechanic is called **Encroaching Darkness**, the name being copied from [here](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Encroaching_Darkness).

# Mechanics

**Mine Depth** \-- This works when players explore lost mines. Each mine is a complex labyrinth with multiple depths (**3**\-**7**depending on the mine). Each depth adds an **Encroaching Darkness** stack to a maximum of **5**.

**Encroaching Darkness** \-- As you go deeper into the mine, the darkness, the cold and the decay smell makes you question your sanity. For each half hour spent into the mine every PC must pass a **Wisdom Saving Throw** based on the number of stacks he gained, or suffer an insanity penalty.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,79,1504,"D&amp;D 5e has many background options that allow for weary heroes to find rest and respite among locals in whatever city or village they may find themselves in. Here's a list of colorful hosts, from warm to begrudging and innocent to suspicious.

1. A large family of gnomes. They are quite welcoming to guests, and serve dishes upon dishes of rich, steaming food at their meals, often accompanied by the father and the older sons singing.
2. A young tiefling loner who's willing to share his small, spartan flat. A starving-artist type (well, not quite starving, he does pretty well) who specializes in portraits. He doesn't bother the guests if they don't bother him. Keeps his work depicting who he remembers as his mother (an Erinyes) in a safe in his room.
3. A soft-spoken Half-orc librarian and his wife, an Elvish herbalist. She isn't as welcoming as him, but is alright with guests as long as they stay out of the workshop. They both do some of the cooking, so the meals are...unique.
4. A Kobold matriarch. While her children have all moved out, *their* children are dropped off at Grandma's house quite frequently, and she teaches them all she knows. She also runs a small shrine to Bahamut in the cellar.
5. A hot-headed, wealthy heiress and her more rational lady-in-waiting.
6. The prince of a corroding noble line, of late taken to dressing in black, composing gloomy poems, and brooding on the battlements of his manor.
7. A dwarvish professor with a magnificent walrus mustache, as well as his warm, old-fashioned wife (a dressmaker) and their daughter, who's visiting for a month or so from her apprenticeship.
8. The quiet Mother of a hostel run by the temple of the god of the poor. The tragedy and despair of many of her visitors has rubbed off on her a little. The food is outstanding.
9. A not-quite-right young man with ambitions to become a psychologist. Asks far too many personal questions, then goes off on rants about what he thinks shaped his guests to the people they are today. Total quack psychologist, doesn't know what he's saying at all.
10. An Eladrin who's spending a few centuries ""indulging in kindness"". There's a too-good-to-be-true air to the stay. Breakfast in bed, indoor training arena, a small dungeon built underneath the manor and stocked with inexpensive monsters, a wizard's study, everything they could possibly want. And the host is always smiling.
11. A jovial Goliath with an Australian accent who spends most of his time wrestling with various dangerous forms of wildlife. Owns a large merchant company, spends most of his time doing push-ups or lifting weights or wrestling yetis.
12. A shriveled, wrinkled, hobbling old Bullywug whose sentences are out of order, and seems to speak in riddles. He wears a slightly threadbare robe and carries a walking stick.
13. A stern Halfing dance instructor. She's quite sprightly, humming waltz tunes as she works. She corrects people's postures out of force of habit.
14. An old Dragonborn mercenary who frequently lapses into a thousand-yard-stare. While not tormented by nightmares, he's a good-humored guy with quite a few tips on adventuring.
15. A water genasi weaver whose skill isn't quite unmatched, but it's up there. Naturally, the curtains and carpets of his house are expertly made and quite flamboyant.
16. A cackling, bitter old woman. Actually a Green Hag, and her curse is the reason the couple next door (whom she finds insufferable) have been trying for a child for years without success. Serves stew or porridge for every meal from a huge, battered-looking black cauldron.
17. A hard-as-nails half-elf rancher. Owns stables upon stables of pure-bred racing horses. Despises city-slickers.
18. An old Minotaur noble. He wears huge suits, custom-made for him, and has a staff of Animated Objects who sing, dance, and make dinner.
19. A slightly suspicious young woman. Knows far too much about weapons, disappears for long periods of time, and locks the basement door very heavily. She's an assassin for a local gang of racketeers, and will skip town if she's found out.
20. An Animated Armor that speaks like the Discworld golems (That Is, She Talks Like This) and moves very jerkily. She (well, it's built for a female humanoid) used to work for an evil artificer before a band of adventurers gave her full free will. Knows a thing or sixty-four about dungeoneering, and considers herself indebted to all adventurers.
21. A goblin horse-jockey who loves nothing more than the thrill of a race. Talks a mile a minute, usually boasting about his races, and his house is full of trophies that he polishes devoutly.
22. A human card-sharp who won his entire house in a game of Triple Ogres. He's married to the shrewd but not very welcoming owner of a local tavern. She brings home the latest gossip each night.
23. A kobold artificer who's trying to turn his species' natural affinity for mechanisms to the good. Owns all sorts of fascinating contraptions, like an automatic pencil-sharpener or a tiny construct that writes down any good ideas he has mid-conversation.
24. A merry old smuggler, although he's put his pirating days behind him aside from the odd chorus of Dead Man's Chest. His house is adorned with model ships and sketches of exotic shores. Drinks strong home-brewed grog.
25. The town doctor. There's something odd about her of late. She stays up past midnight, tends to skip meals, and always seems to be tearing up some piece of paper and tossing it in the trash. (She's smitten with the blacksmith's apprentice, but can't bring herself to tell him.)
26. A rough-and-ready frontier-dwelling female Dwarf, who lives in a quaint cottage. She's older than most of the village, and knows all the skills of the hinterlands: medicine, hunting, cooking, the lot.
27. An old man who can't seem to look you in the eye. He has one craft, and one craft only: he's a knife maker. Assassins from every syndicate, court or gang come to him for their daggers. Even the odd Drow comes in the dead of the night to buy an honest-to-Lolth Master Work dagger.
28. A scheming duke who tries to see if the party thinks his power-plays would work without hinting too obviously at his massive ambitions.
29. A satyr couple who are, well, typical satyrs. They love wine, music, food, the usual revel stuff. Enjoy having guests, of course, but can't stand 'sticks in the mud', 'killjoys' or 'introverts'.
30. A female Drow who left the Underdark because she's claustrophobic. Polite, in a regal sort of way. Her house doesn't have hallways so much as long, broad halls, with bookcases or coffee tables or armchairs.
31. A newer vampire who is having a little bit of an identity crisis. He *gets* the 'nocturnal' part, yes, he gets that, but isn't the whole 'domination' thing a little unethical? and similar conversation. Keeps forgetting that garlic tastes disgusting to him now.
32. The best Dwarvish pastry-chef that has ever walked the earth. And she knows it. Quite boastful.
33. The keeper of a local shrine to the fire god. He'll just sit by the fireplace, staring into it for hours on end. Has a very large and overly friendly golden retriever.
34. The local 'crazy cat lady'. An Air Genasi whose hair is *always* blowing in a gentle breeze. This confuses her cats to no end. She has forty-three of them, and one Mimic who enjoys it's current lifestyle and has decided to stay shaped like a cat.
35. A Tabaxi game-warden. His wolfhound isn't part wolf, it's part Displacer Beast, which means people often think he has two dogs. Pleasant but fairly quiet.
36. A grizzled old human war veteran. Wears an eyepatch. Has a suit of plate-armor stained with horrific, otherworldly humors in his front hall. Retired after ridding his ancestral estate of some kind of great beast he refuses to describe.
37. A gnomish scientist who studies modrons. He's utterly fascinated by them, and can go on for *hours* with horrifically dull facts and factoids about them. His house is littered with mounted modrons, dissected modrons, everything modron-related you could imagine.
38. A time-wizard who messes with his personal time for kicks. Making himself twelve years old, being in four places at once. He thinks it's a riot. His house is full of books of temporal magic, or at least it was, twelve minutes before you try to open one of them. Opening one book makes them all vanish to the past. It's his security system.
39. A noble Knight Lord who lives in a small castle and commands an order of chivalrous Knights. A former adventurer.
40. A wise Grand Wizard who lives in a magic tower and commands a guild of powerful Wizards. A former adventurer.
41. A clever Spymaster who lives in a heavily-secured manor and commands a guild of Spies. A former adventurer.
42. A pious High Priest of Light who lives in a modest house attached to a glorious Temple. A former adventurer.
43. A homely man with balding white hair, a small beard and eyeglasses. Meets with friends often, talking for hours in the cellar. Are they...acting? Playing some sort of dice-game? It's not quite clear. Says he hails from the realm of Greyhawk.
44. An elvish professor of languages who, despite having fought in several wars, is a honorable, straight-laced, old-fashioned gentleman. He's writing a rather long book. Apparently it's about halflings and some kind of Ring?
45. A razor-witted Dwarvish comedian who does standup at local taverns, dishing out the side-clutchers and knee-slappers galore. Willing to share a few jokes with the party, too. His 'why did the cockatrice cross the road?' always gets 'em.
46. A Bugbear leg-breaker for the local mob is trying way too hard to be polite and gracious. His apartment's nice, of course, but he seems to think that the entire party are some sort of sting operation.
47. A former Underdark delver, this calm but dispassionate female Tiefling is married to a far more bubbly and cheery Wood Elf. They bicker regularly about what ""acceptable decorations"" are, stuffed Troglodyte heads or singing roses.
48. A brawny whiskey-maker who meets over a nice, old keg with rogues and grave-robbers every night, it seems. His house is above his tavern.
49. An Eladrin woodcarver who has recently taken up trying to enchant things. She's terribly confident it'll work out eventually, but for now you'll have to put up with wooden busts that hurl abuse or curse words and cutlery that work together to spell out rather rude slang.
50. A Halfling balloonist with a terrible case of wanderlust. Half of his things haven't been unpacked yet, half of them are already ready to go.
51. A master wizard who crafts Golems. Has some shady deals with dungeon overlords, but is still a good man. Might cut the Evil Overlords off from his business if approached; he's a man of principles, just needs a push of sorts to get him to stand his ground for them.
52. An Aasimar teamster who's moving into the song business. He's got quite the voice, and a few songs already written: All Shook Up, 500 Miles, and he's working on a few more.
53. A slightly edgy Tiefling who wants to be both friendly and intimidating. Budding metalhead. His apartment is nearly plastered with band posters and song lyrics.
54. A genteel, aristocratic Red Dragon who lives in an enormous castle.
55. A curious young man enamored by the sea. Despite his youth, his hair is receding. He never seems to blink, either. His house is full of weird idols and jewelry of ancient civilizations.
56. A charlatan 'wizard' who's really just a chemist. Tries to keep her lab hidden. Nearly has a breakdown if she's confronted about her fraud.
57. A Goliath strongman of the local circus. His quarters are rather large, because *he's* rather large. They're right next to the acrobats' and the lion tamer's.
58. A vain elvish wizard who spends most of her time in front of her magic mirror, and the rest of it complaining about upload schedules and dislike mobs and ad revenue.
59. A dwarvish butcher. His wife is an author. Both of his daughters are in preschool. He himself is a pescitarian (thanks, u/Nym_Stargazer) . Spends his evenings playing pool in the cellar with his friends, or going on walks with his daughters.
60. A professional court-jester of the local duke or lord. Not as cheery off the job; gripes to anyone who'll listen about his poor wages and difficult job. His house is a small cottage within the bailey of the castle.
61. A tight-lipped priest who seems to have a shrine to every god in his tiny house. The hallways are crammed with altars and icons, and the whole place smells like incense 24/7.
62. An unintentionally insufferable Aasimar ballerina. Lets the guests have the run of the kitchen; she's too busy practicing for her next performance in the studio downstairs.
63. A young bachelor Mountain Dwarf, who's bitter about getting turned down by the local army or militia. He's drinking a little more than is good for him.
64. A gnomish jeweler, his wife and three children. They have a pretty large townhouse. The husband is a little busy with an important order: a new crown for an anonymous nobleman.
65. A halfling priest of various gods of knowledge and nature. He's a part-time biologist, running a few experiments in the lab in his basement. He'd love to meet a Druid or Ranger with more hands-on experience than himself.
66. A Fey who lives in a checkers-themed tower. May kick the guests out if they mention chess or use chess analogies. Most of the food is circular (pie, pancakes, etc.), the tablecloths and bedsheets all have checkered patterns. Writes long letters to a bitter rival.
67. A Fey who lives in a chess-themed tower. Gets rather testy if people mention checkers. The staff are construct automatons that only move like particular chess pieces. Complains about a completely irrational rival who sends him storms of nonsense letters every day.
68. A professional human trick-shot-archer. She goes on tour with the circus now and then. Her favorite one is nailing a playing card out of someone's hand from one hundred paces.
69. A stout Dwarf who's a master cook. He puts his heart and soul into every slab of beef, taking hours just to prepare them for barbecuing. Doesn't spend much time with the guests.
70. A human former doctor (she's still got the beak-mask hung up on the wall in an airtight case, and she warns the party that it's quite contaminated) who retired after fighting some sort of otherworldly entity beneath her ancestral estate. Recently took up horse-riding.
71. A human comedian whose jokes tend to be at his own expense. Unmarried but pretty well-off, for a comedian. He tends to leave in the evening and come back close to midnight after his show.
72. An eladrin priest of Tymora. Closer to his fey ancestry than most Eladrin. He's scheming with a local gang to spring some of their hooligans from prison- after all, the whims of chance are unpredictable, or so he'll say if the party threatens to inform the authorities. Then he will try and bribe them.
73. A calm Oriental-looking man who works as a janitor during the day. His apartment isn't exactly barren, but it's certainly unextravagant. He's teaching a local child the various martial arts he mastered in his time as a Monk.
74. A simple Halfling herb-farmer. She has a small plot of land behind her house, where she grows things like spices and vegetables. Patient, because as she says, you can't hurry peppers. Spends most of her time reading novels.
75. A dragonborn tale-weaver. No, not an author, she's quite firm. A tale-weaver, the kind that don't get written down so much as passed along. Though she doesn't exactly have it in writing, she's very familiar with the wording and themes that make a riveting tale.
76. A solemn, gods-fearing Dwarvish carpenter. They call him the Pious Benchmaker, which baffles him. His wife is of somewhat better cheer, but tolerates no nonsense in her house. The furniture is first-rate. You could hit it with a battle-hammer and it wouldn't dent.
77. An Aasimar mattress-maker. Laments his own misfortune: his mattresses are so good, he either sleeps on them and can't get himself out of bed, or he sleeps on a couch or armchair and doesn't sleep well. It's a DC X Strength save to get off his guest-beds (the best ones, for he's quite hospitable), where X is 10 plus the number of days since the sleeper has been in a normal bed instead of a bedroll or cot.
78. A slightly unhinged half-orc scholar. He's studying all sorts of bizarre phenomena at once, and keeps a wall covered in notes, sketches, and pieces of twine connecting them. The statistical anomalies of coin flips, the way the planet is tilted, all those sorts of things. Frequently becomes so engrossed in his studies he forgets to eat.
79. A ratcatcher who is quite ferocious in his task. He's got mousetraps all over the place, and hundreds of rat skulls nailed to his wall. Grim, adamant, and talks at length about what utter vermin rodents are.
80. A friendly, jocular doppelganger illusionist and it's tame mimic pets. The house *appears* to have a large staff of servants and much finely-made furniture...
81. A gnomish Expert Clown. He doesn't just study mere tossing and tumbling, mind you. He studies the *psychology* of clowning. What makes a pie to the face so funny? Or what is the thrill-inducing factor of juggling eggs? He can tell you. He can tell you for several hours.
82. A human stone-carver and his teenage son. The son's a little worried about his father, as the latter seems to be losing interest in the craft. Their house is full of half-finished works.
83. A high elf mask-maker. It's a delicate craft, she'll tell you. Fey come to call every so often, picking up their masks but also staying to chat with her a bit. So do some actors. And one or two assassins.
84. A scruffy human gravedigger. He isn't exactly a philosopher, but tends to make incisive remarks about mortality and time. Doesn't like elves, because they don't give him business.
85. An old man with a bald head and gleaming eyes. If asked, he only gives his profession as 'chemist', and spends a lot of time in his lab. He's less harmless than he seems; he's the master poison-brewer for a local assassin's guild. If he's found out, he calls in his allies on whoever discovered his true identity.
86. A young couple of a Tiefling and an Aasimar. Their ancestors didn't like the marriage much, and it couldn't exactly get officiated by a priest (but the local marriage law did allow for a Fey to do the job). They're getting along fine.
87. A pious couple who are gravely concerned about their young daughter. She claims to see 'shadowy people' in the cellar, and apparently brought the family dog back to life. They're both nearly nervous wrecks, and priests of every Good god have been coming and going all week to try and exorcise the child.
88. A white-haired old man and his shrill wife, both the village healers, although the Mr. recently got fired by the prince whose father he used to work for.
89. A playwright who is outraged at his rivals trying to spread the rumor that his work was ghostwritten for him. Insists on reading off sonnets and scenes to the guests to prove that he's genuine.
90. A grizzled, scarred town guard. He's only in during the day, usually asleep, and spends the nights walking the streets and smoking very particular cheap cigars. Moody but not hostile.
91. A 'professional quest-giver' who pampers the heroes with everything he can. He's in kahoots with a local dungeon-lord, and gets a share of the armor, weapons and loot of the heroes killed in the dungeon he directs them towards. He'll take to the hills if he's found out.
92. A young priestess of a god of the wilds. Her house is on the very outskirts of town, and has a terrible case of rats, which she doesn't mind as long as they don't bother the guests. Rats that do bother the guests get speared. She doesn't take nonsense, but has some sense of humor.
93. A Kenku minstrel who rents a room above the tavern he performs in. It's covered in posters from his ""glory-days""- although a keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will note that they're actually *other* bards' posters, with the minstrel's name altered into them.
94. An apprentice baker and his wife, a schoolteacher. Their house was a cheap deal, and is a little run-down but still serviceable. Gets a little drafty, though.
95. A Kobold who claims to be an architect and interior designer. Actually, she's a dungeon planner who designs catacombs, lairs and castles galore. Highly sought-after by evil overlords, and frantically tries to direct them away while the guests are there. If she's found out, she'll flee to the safety of one of her closer creations.
96. A Swordsmith who has been at it for years. He keeps a display case of splintered, shattered or blunted swords recovered from various dungeons and battlefields, each with the tale of a fallen hero attached to it.
97. A halfling gourmand with an affinity for candies. He's a longstanding foe of witches who use his creations, or mockeries thereof, to lure children into their cook-pots.
98. A Dwarvish family of four- father, mother, son, daughter -who are rather new in town. Hospitable, but the house is still full of moving crates. The father is a lumberjack, the mother is a stay-at-home parent.
99. The High Priest of a local shrine of the god of travelers and messengers. He's an unmatched source of information, references and road maps, and will greet anybody with a smile so long as they return the favor.
100. An old Elvish couple. The husband spends most of his time golfing or whittling, the wife is busy giving advice to her newly-married daughter. They live in a nice old house, although there's a ghost in the attic. Don't worry, it's very polite during the day, and it can't leave the attic.

# Overview of the Guide

DM Development Guides are designed to enhance flavor and mechanics for a more detailed world and player engagement. The devil is in the details as the saying goes, and thus the guides will incorporate lore, background and mechanics that are easy to insert in any campaign. Each guide is designed to work together or individually to help a DM grow their world to the level of detail they wish. The guides could even work in the hands of a player who wants information to use in roleplay of a character that is proficient in the topic of focus. The different topics will range from wilderness biology and ecology, survival and medicine, geosciences, to urban civics and economics.

This guide is about Orienteering and Navigation. It is designed to supplement the survival skill with actual information regarding navigation and travel - those moments where a party is lost or trying to figure out which way to go should have more narrative action than a d20 roll and “you (do/don’t) find your way.”

# Orienteering and Navigation

*Orient yourself with purpose; you’ll never feel lost if you’re always on the way to your destination*.

***Lore and Background***

**Aiming Off**

&gt;When following linear features (handrails) in the terrain, aiming off helps ensure a traveler can safely reach the desired feature by deliberately aiming to one side. By aiming left or right of the desired handrail, the traveler will always know which way to turn and look for the feature even if their pacing takes them off line slightly. For instance, if the traveler deliberately aims their path to the left of their target handrail before they start pacing, when they reach their pace distance they know with confidence that the checkpoint feature they want to attack the next point from is on their right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Attack Points**

&gt;Orienting yourself in the world is a lost art - especially as you traverse the wilds. Use notable landmarks when roads and paths are not available - a good attack point should be easy to see on the horizon and close to the direction of the ultimate destination. A strong point of attack keeps travelers from fading into endless or circular wandering. Identify a landmark on the horizon, navigate to it with a predatory instinct and handrails, then identify the next landmark to attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**Controlling Points**

&gt;Travelers should use a catch feature to ensure they do not overshoot their desired target by over pacing. Pick a linear landmark (rivers work well) that crosses perpendicular to the desired travel route and is beyond the next handrail or attack point. If the traveler reaches their catch feature, they know definitely that they have strayed from course and traveled too far. Employ relocation strategy and plot a new course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Handrails**

&gt;Using linear features in line of sight is the simplest, and most important, aspect of setting and keeping a course. Consider it a checkpoint on the way to an attack point. Aim off and set a control point as boundary safeguards - then pace from handrail to handrail until the attack point is reached.

&amp;#x200B;

**Panic Azimuth**

&gt;A panic azimuth is the last safeguard from becoming lost in travels. Pick a direction that will assuredly lead back to civilization or safe harbor. If the control and attack points somehow fail and orientation is obscured, set a course along the panic azimuth and head back to civilization.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scaling a Map**

&gt;Determining the distance in sight is significantly easier than on a map. The simplest method for scaling a map will be to find two marked landmarks on the map, or a single landmark if the traveler can reliably mark their current location on the same map. Determine distance (furlongs) in sight and compare it to the space between the two landmarks or the traveler and the landmark on the map. Use a thumb width and measure that space on the map and calculate how many furlongs are within a thumb.

&amp;#x200B;

**Travelers**

&gt;To travel is to embrace exposure. Natural dangers pose a constant threat, but it is often the artificial dangers created by other travelers that pose the greatest risk. Always rely on the self for survival when possible. Check your path with your own devices - the easiest way to lose oneself is to attempt a traverse on the path of another.

&amp;#x200B;

***Applicable Tools and Skills***

**Compass and Map**

&gt;A map and compass are the most reliable tools for crossing wilderness. The map must indicate which direction is magnetic north by something like a compass rose or some other clear notation and the traveler must know where they are on the map before they set a course. Hold the map in the non-dominant hand and then press the compass flat on the map near the compass rose. Rotate the compass so that the indicator for north aligns with the notation for north on the map. Use the map and look at the compass to identify the direction to travel - the course a traveler sets in this direction is called a bearing. Holding the compass and map in front, turn to face the desired bearing and seek any marked landmarks for visual confirmation of the compass bearing and map accuracy. Set an attack point on the horizon and a handrail within reliable sight (calculate the paces to the handrail). Aim off, anticipate control points with a catch feature and start pacing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Contour Interpretation and Topography**

&gt;If a traveler is lucky enough to have a map that measures three dimensional landscapes then it probably uses contour lines to indicate the topography (the rise and fall in elevation across the landscape). The contour lines connect parts of the landscape of equal elevation, so the gaps between contours indicate rises and falls in elevation, usually by a standard amount. The closer the contours, the steeper the climb or fall; the further apart the more gradual the change in elevation. Paying attention to contours could help a tracker plot the fastest course or, if they are being pursued, lead their pursuers into a trap. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pace Counting &amp; Measuring Distance**

&gt;The most useful units of measurement on land are the furlong and the pace. In a clear field there are about 24 furlongs to the horizon (meta: based on the curvature of Earth the horizon is about 3 miles away). A furlong is the length of a standard lordly horse yard.   
&gt;  
&gt;Each traveler will have to track their gait across a furlong to establish their pace. Walking and counting normal steps across a horse yard will be sufficient to gauge a travelers standard pace. For the type of travelers that find themselves in pursuit or retreat with regularity, it might be prudent to measure pace with deliberately long strides or brisk running as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the field, set handrails at a specific distance in furlongs (base this on visibility conditions and determine the most distant handrail that is within reasonable sight). Then, aim off and count the paces (furlongs multiplied by pace rate) on heading to reach the appropriate distance and locate the handrail.   
&gt;  
&gt;At sea, the furlong is replaced by the cable, and there are about 30 cables to the horizon on open water. Depth is also important for setting course and depth is measured in fathoms. A fathom can be measured as the head to toe length of a large human male (meta: 6 feet). Sea depth may serve as a navigation tool if depth is charted along the course and can be measured reliably from the vessel. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Relocation Technique**

&gt;When a traveler has lost their location, they can relocate their position on their map with by using a compass and a marked landmark that is within view. Press the compass on the map and face the landmark. Read what directional bearing to get to the landmark and judge distance. Determine location by reversing the directional bearing from the compass to the landmark (so if, for example, the landmark is on a northeast bearing, the relocation bearing is southwest) and measuring back using the reversed bearing on the map for the approximate distance starting from the landmark. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Star Navigation (Nautical and Night)**

&gt;Travelling at night can be troublesome as landmarks and horizons become tougher to track in the sky. The same methods apply at sea, where landmarks may be nonexistent. Polaris (on Earth), is the north star, and critical for navigating by stars. Recognize the constellation known as the saucepan or the big dipper and use the two stars on the front of the pan or cup to point directly to the north star. The constellation Cassiopeia always rests directly across the north star from the saucepan so a traveler who can spot both of these star groupings will always know north at night. This star rests directly above the northern pole and will always mark north, and if the traveler is in the northern hemisphere can also determine approximate latitude on their chart by measuring the angle of the north star in the night sky. An average fist makes an angle of 10 degrees on the horizon, so simply count fists to the north star and that is the latitude heading. Those travelling in the southern hemisphere may use the star Mimosa, the bright star that forms the left hand of a constellation known as the southern cross, or the Crux similarly to determine true south and latitude.

***Mechanics and Progression***

Navigating in the wild should feel a little more elaborate than a simple die roll and then flat success/fail transit. Perhaps consider employing some tables with wilderness encounters, puzzles where the party has to relocate because they stray off course or at the minimum use some of the tables below to populate landmarks or vignettes along the path so the player who is keeping a map or a path can have some flavor to go on instead of “we go back the way we came.” Urban navigation is entirely different and probably shouldn’t require a compass and tools. These are opportunities for social encounters, combat ambush, con games, hooks and mystery vignettes. 

***Tables***

**Landmarks (d20)**

These tables are to flavor the path of a travelling party. They are not intended to include any of the pre-planned content (so don’t expect to see taverns, equipment shops and the places any DM would already have in mind). Instead, these are for random settings, vignettes and quick moments of story development that will enrich the experience for any group, albeit they certainly could be used to offer plot hooks as well. Decide which environment is most appropriate, roll a d20 and then narrate the scene.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,38,657,"I was running a side session for two characters who needed a red herring. They entered a ruined tower, and upon ascending to the second floor they find only 4 dusty sarcophagi. When they descend back down the stairs the room below is almost an exact copy of the one they exited, but a sarcophagus has it's lid set aside. 

Inside is a lever, and the lid of each sarcophagus has a letter carved in it. E, I, T, and X. As you go up or down the stairs the open sarcophagus moves clockwise or counter clockwise respectively. To open it they have to pull levers 1, 4, 2, and then 3, spelling exit. 

You can change the letters or number of sarcophagi, but this worked really well for me, thanks for reading!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,22,580,"Inspired by a question I saw on /r/DnD, I thought about how most quest rewards now are in the form of magical items and gold. These are great foundations that the party ""requires"" to adventure. I say ""requires"" because they are what the players expect to hear at the end of a quest. We killed a dragon? How much was in its hoard? Ooh a Flaming Dragon Tongue +3! Etc. But quests in many other games and especially in DnD should result in more than just additional numbers on a character sheet. So here are some other rewards I have noticed elsewhere and tried to implement in my own campaign.

# Renown    

Might as well get the obvious one out of the way. Let's say your party killed a dragon, and goes back into town toting all the dragon scales and hoard. People should take notice. Dragon slayers aren't common and if you knew the person you were dealing with is one of the Slayers of the Western Dragon, you'd be much more nicer to them if only out of fear.

But more importantly, lack of renown should also be apparent to make the importance of renown actually mean something. If your no-name level 2 characters can meet with the King of the land just by asking nicely, then it's not as rewarding as needing to have prove themselves by doing something like fighting off the goblin invasion in a nearby village. 

# Connections

Tied closely with renown, but on a more personal basis. Connections can mean anything from having a NPC follower in the party to just having a certain NPC know your name. Important connections can be things like Merchants, Blacksmiths, Explorers, Cartographers, Captains of ships, Guard Captains, etc. Each of these has a real benefit that they can offer the party, but favor like that should be earned. Whether that's by finding their lost cat or delving deep into an ancient tomb to recover old space metal, it doesn't matter, but it also does help to flesh out your NPCs in a different way. Other characters that could be important and an excellent reward for quests like these is the discovery of/ meeting NPCs from a character's backstory.

# Disconnections

These are people you really annoyed by doing a quest. I call this a reward for the simple fact it is a reward for the DM. Enemies are always fun to play with and sometimes the best way to finish a quest is just to have the angry Dragon Keeper show up at the end of the quest to declare their inevitable and long winded revenge. From a safe distance of course.

Other disconnections could be factions or countries that no longer care for you based off of the people you helped with your quests. Not everyone will like your party and that should be something you embrace, albeit sparingly unless your party wants to be literally hated by the world. 

# Lore

Lore can be it's own reward. If your party really wants to know the secrets of how the ancient lich got his start, that could be entirely it's own quest! They delve into the ruins of a long destroyed village and have to try to piece together what it might have been like living there and how this place was destroyed. If the secret of this reveals a possible location of the phylactery, all the better! But it doesn't have to.    
For example, in one of the Harry Potter moves, Harry and Dumbledore visit Tom Riddle's orphanage home. This is a very, very short quest, and the only real reward from it was more background of who Tom Riddle was, and clues for future investigations.

# Rumors

Going alongside Lore a bit, rumors are slightly different. Rumors are potential plot hooks for their own side quests. They can be rumors about the 5 pieces of armor scattered throughout the world that once assembled can create the world's most powerful defense. Or they can be rumors about how a beloved NPC has been seen in the back alleys of a different city. Rumors tend to be quite powerful, as players will almost always assume them to be true, however they do not have to be. Rumors are things to investigate cautiously, a careless player could be easily lead into a trap if they followed a bad rumor. 

# Pets

Now this one is probably one that a lot of new DMs run into on accident almost. The party will inevitably at some point, try to save a dog or cat or other animal poorly suited to adventuring like a displacer beast. The best thing you can do as a DM, is to provide the party with an excellent adventuring and dungeon delving friend like a frilled lizard that definitely is a dragon no matter what anybody else says. 

# Cake

A nice change of pace for everyone. These rewards are just nice, fun things to help the party roleplay/ wind down after a long stressful quest. Bonus points for actually bringing a cake/ other desserts for everybody to enjoy alongside their characters. This can be anything from desserts to drinks, to parties, to salon/spa days. Characters need to relax sometimes too!

# Conclusion

Now not every quest should have one of these rewards, sometimes a goblin cleanup is just a post on a quest board and that's it. But good, plot heavy, or just memorable quest probably has multiple elements to varying degrees outside of just a single reward. I hope that this helps a couple of people looking for other ideas for questing rewards. Anyway, happy adventuring!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,32,414,"These are some ideas for adverse combat conditions and interesting encounters I've come up with or gleaned from other posts on various RPG forums.

Update: Thank you, Redditors, for the upvotes, and the 2 silver pieces. If you do use these ideas, feel free to tell me how your players reacted to the problems, or solved them. 

1. Time warp, minor: Initiative has a 10% chance of being re-rolled on each turn.
2. Time warp, major: Initiative has a 25% chance of being re-rolled on each turn.
3. Temporal Havoc I: Re-roll initiative each turn.
4. Temporal Havoc II: Players and monsters have a 10% chance of gaining 1 level of exhaustion every turn. Being healed removes Exhaustion.
5. Temporal Havoc III Use With Caution: Players have a 10% chance of losing or gaining (evens: gain, odds: lose) 1d4 levels until end of turn each turn.
6. Non-Euclidean Space: A classic, but tricky. Simple way to run it: describe the battlefield as skewed and warped from the actual map to the players. A pillar is described 10 feet to the left of itself, a room is 20 meters longer than it really is, and so on.
7. Feywild Fighting: Damage cannot be inflicted with mere weapons. Use things like insulting poetry or the embarrassing personal history of your opponent to damage their resolve.
8. Fighting while sliding down a rope.
9. Running fight in tight alleyways- try not to get lost.
10. Night-fighting/Blindfighting/Free-for-all: Players run the risk of losing one another in the melee and/or accidentally attacking each other. Works best in a hectic fight in tight spaces.
11. Losing battle: Players must muster demoralized allies or be overwhelmed.
12. Pillbox: Enemy ranged troops are secured in a bunker on a hill, peppering attackers with spells, arrows, javelins or slingstones.
13. Fortunate Son: Fighting in a trackless jungle against natives who know the terrain better than you.
14. Home Alone: Fighting against an enemy cornered in some kind of fortress. They've had plenty of prep time and are determined to fight to the end.
15. Fighting in a strictly formal duel, with ancient codes of combat that are held nearly sacred.
16. Disrupted Decorum: Fighting amidst fleeing crowds in an opulent hall with fountains, buffet tables and, of course, chandeliers.
17. Police Brutality: Fighting against riled peasants who think all heroes are murder-hobos. Killing them will only damage your reputation further.
18. Take This Outside: Fistfight. More people will pile into the brawl as it goes along, eventually getting to the guards coming to try and break it up.
19. Carriage/wagon/horse chase.
20. Arena: Players must make their fighting entertaining to a bloodthirsty crowd.
21. Illusory Terrain, minor: Enemy spellcasters conjure obstacles and cover where there are none.
22. Illusory Terrain, major: Enemy spellcasters use their magic to stimulate complete change of terrain, powerful monsters fighting for them, or a myriad more troops than there really are.
23. Battle Amidst the Flames: Smoke inhalation, burning terrain, intense heat.
24. Kreuger Combat I: Fighting inside dreams or somebody's mind. Dream-figments, imaginary friends or memories of real people may join the fight on either side.

28. Zero-gravity environment.
29. Low-gravity environment, with a particularly large enemy pulling all other combatants towards it.
30. Slippery Slope: Fighting downhill. The more physical an action is, the further you might slide: swinging a warhammer destabilizes you more than casting a spell.
31. Stealth Optional: Fighting must be completely silent, at the risk of attracting more enemies.
32. Ground Pound: A large enemy periodically uses moves like stomping or slamming the ground. Players and NPC combatants must make Acrobatics checks or similar saves to prevent themselves from being knocked prone.

36. Fog of War: Fighting obscured by smoke, fog, or fumes, with enemy archers or artillery firing into the battle.
37. Sparta: Fighting against resolute enemies holding a bottleneck area.

39. Blink And You Miss It: Fighting against extraplanar enemies who pop into the Material Plane momentarily to attack.
40. This Is Halloween: Root out and quietly put paid to genuine monsters mingling among the royal costume-ball with malicious intent towards the monarch. Raising a ruckus will only cause panic, and allow the monsters to make use of that to take out the monarch.
41. Retroactively: Combatants start combat dead, and fight backwards, gaining life with each attack until they're alive and well- but each knows the other's weaknesses and strategies now.

58. House of mirrors fight.
59. Jungle canopy fight.
60. Enemies with attack dogs. Or attack wolves. Or attack worgs.
61. Landslide. Boulders tumble through the fight.
62. Shuffle Mode. Enemies change with other monsters of equal CR every 1d8 rounds. Re-roll the round counter after each replacement.
63. Concert: enemy war-chants, beast roaring or similar loud noises prevent verbal communication on either side of the fight.

69. Dungeon boss got over-enthusiastic. Work *with* weary, underpaid minions to get to his control center through flame gouts, dart spitters, poison-needle doorknobs and mimic infestations. Workers know their section- but only that, and you might not get a complete picture from the multiple accounts.
70. Drugged-up Orcs all have level 2 Barbarian Rage effects.
71. Hit-and-run charioteers ram, use spears or shoot arrows.

74. Battle boarding sahuagin on a rain-slicked deck.
75. Dojo / Mortal Kombat: Fight your way up through progressively tougher challengers in a ritual combat.
76. Blitzkrieg: Under attack by enemy cavalry and infantry at once, while catapults and siege spells destroy indiscriminately.
77. Stark Industries Necromancy: Undead troops have gimmicks like metal plating bolted on to them for higher AC, built-in swords or crossbows, sigils that allow them to cast spells, or similar gadgets and contraptions.
78. Breathless: Constructs don't need air. The factory where they're made is vacuum-sealed. And you need to shut it down.
79. Siege Monster: Protect the signal tower from the angry trolls and ogres for long enough that a call for help can be made.
80. The Cavalry Arrive!...on the enemy's side.
81. A heavy ballista mounted on a platform in the intersection of the bad guys' stronghold-city is tying up massive amounts of manpower in the final invasion. A forward assault is no good; you need to use the side streets and interrupt the supply line of bolts.
82. Sure, the firebombs worked. Now get out of the haunted forest, without being eaten by the angry, now-on-fire Treants and Awakened Shrubs or Trees.
83. An enemy Bard recites morbid poetry, becoming more despairing as his allies are cut down. The song becomes more and more effective as it gets gloomier, forcing repeated willpower saves. If he alone remains, failure on the saves will result in the player's character falling into despondent weeping until the song is ended.
84. Within a plane of cold Law and logic, initiative is determined and attacks are made with INT instead of DEX. Damage is dealt to the mind, not the body; 'dying' drives you mad until you leave the plane.
85. Underneath the earth in a profane, ancient temple, you can only truly be 'killed' if you're sacrificed on the altar stone. The baddies are enjoying their immortality; go and spoil their fun.
86. The Cavalry Arrive!...but have no idea how to fight (regenerating enemies, really short enemies, really fast enemies, whatever)
87. Don't Mean to Boast: Impersonate an amateur in your fighting style. A novice Ranger, an apprentice Wizard, etc. Anything else will convince the Evil Overlord that he's been tricked into fighting real Heroes, not the Lesser Heroes he demanded for the duel.
88. The typical Viking/Scottish Hill Giant challenges the party to a duel of boasts and feats, without any combat.
89. Drinking contest with the Viking Lord! Find a way to stop him from drinking all that mead his rivals poisoned, but also win the duel to prevent yourselves from being expelled from his lands.
90. Mountains Out of Molehills: Evil duergar and galeb-duhr raise mounds of earth to hide behind or pillars to rain arrows down on you from.
91. They've brought a cave troll. (With armor, and a big ballista loaded with explosive bolts. They call it a T'an-que.)
92. It's raining meteors.
93. A trickster fey can only be defeated with honest, straightforward, wooden clubs.
94. Titans block this mountain pass with their millenia-long wargame. Best both their armies or lead one side to victory to clear the pass.
95. This room of the dungeon is thickly carpeted. The carpet is a shaggy variant of the infamous beast of legend, the Trapper. Once it tastes blood, it's appetite will be whetted and it will slowly suck any being that steps on it into it's furry, amorphous maw.
96. Make your escape from the hungry lizardmen by boating down the river that their god, a dire crocodile, lives in.
97. The Helmed Horror has a hostage trapped inside it.
98. Normandy times Negative One: Storm *down* the ridge towards the Drow archer batteries and ballistas.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,86,482,"One of my players wanted a cool way to parry an incoming attack and I think I've come up with a home brew mechanic and I want to see what everyone else thinks, as far as balance and fairness goes. Also, he's not a battle master so THAT parry battle maneuver isn't really in play here. Here's the mechanic now:

&amp;#x200B;

Enemy attacks, they roll and get a 17 to hit, and you decide to parry (which uses your reaction, so only works once per round). So you roll a d20 check and in order to parry you need to ALSO get a 17 for a ""perfect parry"", where you take 0 damage and/or maybe counter attack. I'm not sure if you'd add any modifiers... probably not.

&amp;#x200B;

Or if you get +1 or -1 off the 17, so 16 or 18, you take half damage.Of course, enemies would be able to do the same, haha.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 5% chance for perfect parry, and 10% chance for a normal parry for half damage on top of that. Seems fair still, I think, especially considering enemies can also parry YOUR attacks. Granted, it may slow down combat a smidge, but if the players really want it, it still seems quick enough to not really bog everything down. Also, this would work only for melee attacks. Ranged attacks and spell attacks don't apply here.

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback is welcome :) Thanks.",1,Homebrew Parry Mechanic
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,89,"I originally ran this encounter as the low level party was sheltering inside a old temple-shrine to an ancient fire-goddess that had been turned into an old bandit hideout, and then later, into an Ettercap's lair.  They bedded down without exploring much after a rough encounter with some Giant Wasps that tried to follow them inside the questionable shelter of the temple.  The Ettercap got the drop on them, he and his babies downed and paralyzed the PCs (except for 1 who bravely ran away), and I narrated that the survivors woke up inside his lair.

The entire structure is a three-layer-cake with a central shaft 30 feet wide, going down about 200 feet in total.  The 20 foot wide outer rings of the temple spiral up into a top chamber with a five foot wide hole in the floor in the center that the party can rappel down (or take the curved ramp downwards).  The Ettercap and his pets live inside the ""inner chamber"" which is middle of the central shaft, where the bandits have suspended a dining room table and some chairs by rope, over the 100 foot drop.

I won't bother to describe the Brood Lair and the Ettercap's Pets, beyond saying they were clogging the lower level of the temple with webs and benefited from the up-leveled Ettercap's Innate Spellcasting.

For the encounter, I gave the Ettercap Innate Spellcasting and the ability to cast **Hold Person** once per day, the spell **Web** once per day (in addition to his natural ability), and **Pass Without a Trace** at will, which together raises his challenge rating by at least 1 over a standard Ettercap.  I also narrated that he wears a fancy cap glued to his head by webbing (taken from a bandit-king), in which he stores a Swarm of Poisonous Spiders.  Another swarm lived under his table.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Mad Hatter-cap’s Tea Party***

*Captured by an Ettercap and stored in his Larder, hanging over a 100 foot drop.*

In the center of the Inner Chamber strung across the shaft with a number of support cables made of thick rope (ends lashed around the huge columns) is an old heavy ornate carved and gilded round table 10 feet across.  More ropes suspend a set of chairs around the table.  Many of the chairs have “lumps” in them, as well as other lumps hanging from the ropes throughout the chamber.

The tabletop is scratched and marred by bandit graffiti, but is very thick and could be refurbished with some love and care.  Arrayed around the table, also hanging from rope like a swing, are nine wooden chairs, one of which is grander and more ornate than the others and is placed on the North end of the table in a position of prominence.  The table and chairs, if removed and repaired are worth 50 gold for the table, and 5 gold each for the chairs.

Draped across the rope are, of course, more webs and suspended “lumps” of medium size (tightly wrapped). The underside of the table is heavily webbed as well.  (Incidentally, this is where the Ettercap chooses to sleep most nights.)

Why is this Ettercap named the “Mad Hattercap” in this encounter?  Because he wears a hat and is having a “tea party” with a bunch of “stuffed animals” seated in the chairs.  One, with a little squinting looks like a mummified man wearing a set of oversized rabbit ears (The March Hare).  Another is a small creature, probably a rat, maybe a cat, or possibly a small dog that has been stuffed with twigs and leaves and then mummified (The Dormouse).  A third is a small humanoid (Alice), mummified with spider-silk, wearing what looks to be a colorless and crudely fashioned “fancy” dress with “lacy frills"" and spider-silk ""ribbons"".  Close inspection might reveal a pair of child’s shoes poking out of the mummified wrappings.

The “stuffed animals” are webbed into the swinging chairs and most of the chairs are filled.  The fancy northern chair is always empty.  Webbed to the top of the table is a cracked porcelain tea-set that was probably worth 5 gold when new and unbroken.  Crude bowls and even cruder wooden spoons filled with vile slime, now dried, are placed in front of most of the chairs.

Should any of the PCs manage to get captured by the Ettercap, he’ll clear away a number of the old bodies -- singing, to himself, ""No room, no room, move down!"". Dropping the bodies down the shaft, leaving the March Hare, the Dormouse, and Alice for last. He'll lash the new fresh bodies into the chairs with webbing, leaving the face and mouth open, taking time (if he can) to decorate each with mud or crushed berries and make “fancy dress” for them.

He’ll try and have a “tea party”, force feeding vile slime (the contents of his stomach) in order to keep the party-goers alive as long as possible.  The Ettercap always takes the grand, northern chair.

Bear in mind, all of this is happening inside a shaft, underground, over a 100 foot drop.  The table and chairs swing with every little movement and a stiff breeze blows upwards.  Fighting in this environment should be like Cirque du Soleil.  Strictly speaking, a spider’s poison will paralyze the victims for an hour, but nothing says you can’t stretch this for narrative effect.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Shallow Underdark*** 

The shaft of the Inner Chamber continues down into the darkness for another 100 feet, before reaching a large cavern with a small underground stream flowing through it.   The “Mad Hattercap” dumps dessicated carcases down the hole, but they often get stuck on the rough edges of the shaft due to the sticky nature of webbing.  The dessicated “lumps” often sway in the permanent draft that the shaft has, one or two may actually still be alive but paralyzed, and a few may have turned into undead skeletons unable to move because of their bindings.  Have fun describing the creepy appearance to your players.

&amp;#x200B;

As a bonus, somehow find a way to tell this bedtime story:

***The Little Empress and the Spider-Baby***

Once upon a time, there was a very tiny spider-baby who lived under the floorboards of an adorable and precocious little girl in the town of Cliffsedge. The spider-baby ate the bugs and scared off the rats that dared go under the floorboards of the little-girl’s room, and so, the spider-baby reasoned, earned his rent.

The spider-baby and the little girl soon became friends and playmates at night after her parents went to sleep. Under the floorboards, before bed, the spider-baby would listen-in as the little girl’s parents read stories to her at night. The spider-baby’s favorite was the story about the “*Mad Empress”* who lived underground with mushrooms and cut off the heads of those who disobeyed her.

Some nights, the two friends would have tea-parties with the little girl’s stuffed animals. The little girl would dress up in her mother’s clothes and pretty hat and pretend to be the Mad Empress. The little girl insisted on fancy dress for the party. The spider-baby wove a lovely hat and coat so he too could attend. The spider-baby liked those tea-parties very much.

One night, the little girl went too far in pretending to be the Mad Empress, and cut off the head of her beloved mouse-eared *Frumplekins* with a pair of garden-shears\*.\* The spider-baby was distressed in noticing how much the action troubled the little girl and how the girl’s mother punished her by taking all her stuffed animals away. That night, as the little girl lay crying in her bed, missing her beloved stuffed animals, the spider-baby leapt into action and decided to make new stuffed animals for the little girl!  But where, he wondered, would he get an animal to stuff?

The tiny spider-baby thought long and hard about where to find something to stuff, and the moon rose high into the sky while he cogitated.  His rumination was interrupted, though, by the squeaking of a mean old rat that wanted to make its nest directly below the little girl’s bed!  This would never do!  The spider-baby leapt onto the huge rat and did battle!  The little spider-baby was certain that the squeals and thumps of the struggle would awaken the little girl or her parents, but they never did.

After what seemed like hours of epic battle, the spider-baby killed the rat, which was thirsty work! Satisfying his thirst, the spider-baby drank the rat dry until his little baby belly was round and fat! Happily filled, he then fashioned the dead creature into a stuffed animal by wrapping it in his finest silk and stuffing it with leaves and the dust beneath the floorboards. Here was a new *Frumplekins* for the little-girl! The spider-baby crept out into the darkness, his round little belly almost getting stuck between the crack of the floorboards!  He gently left the new *Frumplekins* *II* in the little-girl’s arms before scurrying back underneath the her room the same way he came in. She quickly stopped her crying and fell right to sleep!

Early the next morning, the spider-baby was horrified to observe the little-girl’s mother’s reaction to his gift. She screamed and took *Frumplekins II* away from the little girl, throwing him into the fire to burn! The fire burned all of the spider-baby’s finest silk that he had spent all night making! The spider-baby vowed to make *Frumplekins III* the next night so the little girl wouldn’t have to go to sleep crying and alone!

The spider-baby looked beneath the floorboards of the house, but could find nothing suitable to be the Mad Empress’s stuffed subjects! There were no more rats under the floorboards of the little girl’s house to be made into toys! The little spider-baby was vexed, to say the least. Still, the little spider-baby made up his mind that he must venture outdoors to help his beloved Empress! He also found he was too fat and had grown too large to use the small crack in the floorboards that he used just a few nights before!

The spider-baby put on a brave face and decided that he would leave the house by the same hole that the rats entered! He barely squeezing through! He went out into the village under the light of the full moon. He was frightened at first, and finding rats outdoors was difficult. The spider-baby crept inside the neighbor’s house and was attacked by a giant beast that hissed at him with glowing green eyes and claws! It slashed him and left him bleeding! Running away, the spider-baby decided that there weren’t any rats in that house, either!

The next house was filled with straw and had no floorboards for rats to hide under. Curly furred creatures even larger than the clawed beast inside the neighbor’s house terrified the little spider-baby, but seemed to ignore him. The spider-baby looked everywhere in the house filled with straw but still couldn’t find a rat to make *Frumplekins III*, but the hissing creature from the neighbor’s house was here too! It tried to catch him and eat him! The spider-baby hid under a pile of straw for many hours to avoid the terrifying beast.

A dim glow in the sky told the spider-baby that day would be coming soon and he did not like the bright light of the sun! The beast eventually left the spider-baby and he was able to crawl out, but refused to come home empty-handed! Screwing up his courage and squaring off his shoulders, the spider-baby decided to bring one of these straw-eating creatures home to become *Frumplekins III*. One swift bite was all it took to kill the smallest of the curly furred creatures and the little spider-baby sucked it dry until his belly was near to bursting and he could hardly walk!

Fighting the urge to sleep that always came when his belly was filled, the little spider-baby hurriedly stuffed straw into the flattened animal and dragged it beneath the little-girl’s floorboards.  He and the creature barely fit! The first rays of sunlight were just peeking over the horizon while the spider-baby hurriedly rushed making more silk to wrap *Frumplekins III*. He finished and deposited the stuffed animal in the child’s bed moments before she awoke!

The smile on the little girl’s sleeping face as her arms wrapped around the stuffed animal filled the spider-baby with joy! He crawled to his favorite spot beneath the floorboards, underneath the girl’s bed and happily curled up to sleep, only to be awoken minutes later by the screaming of the girl’s mother! The crying of the little girl, and the alarmed shouting of the girl’s father filled him with fear and dread! The spider-baby watched in horror as *Frumplekins III* was burned!

A cold hatred settled into the spider-baby’s heart that day. There were no bedtime stories that night. The little girl cried herself to sleep. The spider-baby went to work and spun more silk than he had ever had before! He was also much larger after having eaten so well. Just before dawn, the spider-baby deposited *Frumplekins IV* and *V* in the little girl’s bed. They were much, much larger than *Frumplekins II*, and *III,* and the spider-baby knew that the Mother and Father wouldn’t be able to burn these… because he had drained them dry and stuffed them with the down-pillows from their bed! Now they would would never take his Empress’s friends away!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,189,638,"My local shop decided to create their own organized play outside of Adventure League. So the DMs all brainstormed the setting and they went with a frontier town in a new continent mostly populated by goblins and other monster races. The idea being that all the players would do adventures that eventually lead to the expansion of the town into a proper city/country.

I had privately brought up a thought I had about the campaign with a few of my fellow DMs. Mainly that, the idea of adventurers coming into new place to clear out the monster people that originally live there so we could civilize it makes for some pretty obvious overtones of colonialism.

The thought was received thoughtfully by some and skeptically by others. The skepticism, though, was mainly just people going with the ""at the end of the day, this is a fantasy world"" defense, which never really gave me any real satisfaction. I guess because it can be so easily turned around: if, at the end of the day we're creating fantasy worlds, then why not ones where things like colonialism are absent?

I guess I don't really have a concise question about this. Mostly I just wanted to see who else thinks about this shit in there games of pretend. Cos I haven't seen much discussion on it.

Sometimes, the power of a god is insufficient to resist the corruptive influence of those bent on the destruction or subjugation of the universe. Holy water is often used to resist or cure ailments of an unholy nature; however, there comes a time when the very power relied upon is used against the wielder.

Pools of water found around temples or monasteries tend to become holy water be proximity; when a being of great evil purges the land, these pools may be corrupted to lure unsuspecting creatures to their doom. Turning black and viscous, for all intents and purposes the water becomes an immobile slime, exuding the properties of the being that created it.

**The Pools of Seduction:**

These pools reflect the most desirable thing for the creature viewing them; whether it be women, food, or a glorious opponent, the creature views that which it finds irresistible.

&amp;#x200B;

Immune to all damage except fire, they can be frozen and chipped apart; however, upon thawing the shards are drawn together until a sufficient amount has coalesced. As long as there is at least 1 litre, the effects of The Pools of Seduction exude themselves. Each point of fire damage eliminates 1 litre of the pool.

All creatures that can see the pools make a charisma saving throw. On fail, the creatures are charmed and use their action to move towards the pool, with intent to submerge themselves. Should a creature do so, they take damage based on the volume of the pools. 2d12 (DC 10 save) for 1litre to 300 litres; 4d12 (DC 14 save) for 301litres to 1000 litres; 8d12 (DC 18 save) for more than 1000 litres. Half of the damage is Acid, half is Necrotic. If the creature's health is dropped to 0 by this effect, they are consumed and their body is irretrievable; the mass of the creature and all items it is carrying are added to the pool. The creature may make the saving throw at the end of each round; on a pass, the creature is immune to the charm effects for 24 hours.",1,The Pools of Corruption
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,56,90,"Hey all. First-time poster, medium-time lurker...

Another recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/avxhdy/reviewing_xp_systems_and_proposing_an_alternative/) got me thinking about XP, and I thought I would share one of my favorite house rules. It's short and pretty sweet:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**A player may gift some or all of his XP award to any character for any reason.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I started my campaign (AD&amp;D 2e) nearly 10 years ago. At the time, I had been reading *Drive* by Daniel Pink. It's a great survey of research into motivation. It got me thinking about the de-motivating aspects of rewards like XP. According to the research, ""Do this, get this amount"" is a good motivator when it comes to mundane tasks, but it's a poorer motivator when it comes to bigger purpose and long-term goals. At their worst, so-called ""extrinsic"" rewards can promote cheating (""Let's go kill some bears cuz I'm close to a level"", etc.) and can actually be de-motivating, when applied unfairly (""I only got 500xp for killing the dragon, even though I did most of the work"" etc.). I had seen all these problems with XP over the years, and really wanted to avoid anything similar in my own game.

Still, as a player, I loved getting XP, especially when the big awards were few and far between, or when it came from unexpected places, like a random encounter. I especially loved it when the DM gave me a bonus for exceptional play. I didn't want to lose those aspects by implementing something like milestones.

So, I made this sharing rule. The thinking went that, if everyone got the same award, just for showing up, I wouldn't have to be the arbiter of who deserved a special reward. If someone did something brilliant, that acknowledgement would mean more coming from your peers than from the DM.

**Scarcity and Abundance**

For a while, the rule seemed pointless. My 1st level PCs were killing orcs and stirges and hoarding their XP, regardless of anyone else's daring-do or brilliance. But after a while, as battles became more involved and awards got bigger, every so often, there would be some sharing, and it usually boiled down to two types of scenarios:

Love Fest™: After a big battle, with lots of XP and close calls, players would tip each other some XP, out of their abundance.

Why bother™: After a random pest encounter, with XP in the tens of points, players would find it easier to say, ""Give Bob my share"" than to write the award down on their sheet.

**Cheating**

You know the old saying, ""the DM plans and the Players laugh"". It didn't take long before the players ran into their first opportunity to exploit the rule. The druid was close to a level that would give him *Call Lightning*, and the next objective was looking like an outdoor fight. So, after a preliminary encounter, players started giving away their shares expressly to give the druid his level.

And while this felt, at first, like an exploitation of the system to all concerned — including me — I realized it didn't matter. Once the druid got his level, things would return to normal, and he'd probably feel inclined to pay the others back.

**In-game rationale**

As with everything in D&amp;D, the XP mechanic is an abstract model of many things. It represents what you've seen and learned in your travels, but it also represents boring training that happens off screen. So, in a tight-knit squad, why *wouldn't* your peers recognize that you're on the verge of a breakthrough, and work to support that? Maybe that involves picking up the camp chores so you can study longer (which means they can study less). Maybe it means playing a defensive role in sparring, so your fighter can work on his feats (to the detriment of your own progress). Either way, it feels no less realistic than, ""let's go kill some bears cuz I'm close"".

**Assessment**

It's not all roses. Players sometimes grumble when other players are less than generous. On occasion, a player would fail to make a session, get his award, and then not bother gifting any of it to the player who ran his character, so we made an addendum that the award goes to the player *running* the character, to distribute how he sees fit.

Still, after 10 years, I'm pretty happy with the outcome. We have an extremely cooperative and generous group. They're good players to begin with, but I think the policy has helped nurture their cooperative impulses. Right now, they're gifting their XP like crazy to the party's 8th level cleric (in 2E, the jump from 8th to 9th is monstrous), and frankly, I'm looking forward to them having *Raise Dead* at their disposal, so that I can take the gloves off a bit.

In general, there's not a lot of grumbling about XP. I'm pretty generous with awards, but they go many games at a stretch with nothing. But as long as the story line is working, and they're feeling a sense of in-game accomplishment, the XP award is less important.",1,XP Sharing
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,72,707,"A little background - I never quite liked the way 5e dealt with discovering the abilities of magic items. Even the variant rule in the DMG wasn't very appealing, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what I was looking for.  
And then, one day, I got it - the whole proccess just lacked **PC involvement!**  
What do I mean by that?   
Well - either the player needs to just play with the item (and no guideline for how to handle that situation is given) or he just casts Identify and immediatly knows what the item does.   
And the spell can be ritual cast, so basicly there is no cost for it (not talking about monatery cost here, but if you want to be picky - the spell doesn't specify the materiel is consumed, so no big cost there too).  
Simply put, there is no way a player will get a magic item and won't know what it does two turns later. So why not just tell them?  
Or.... why not fix it?  
**TL;DR** - I wanted to make Identifying magic items more interesting and more player-involving. here is my mechanic for it.

*****

A magic item has an identification DC based on his rarity level, when common equals DC 10 and every level thereafter goes up by 5 (uncommon is DC 15 and so on).  
If the item is not magical, but is subject to magical effect (for example, the thaumaturgy cantrip) the DC is 10 + spell level (a cantrip's spell level is 0).  
When a character comes into possession of a magic item, he should try and examine the item to find out what it does. He (or any other character) can roll an Arcana check in addition to the examination.  
The examination should reveal any information about the item that can be understood from physically interacting with the item (shape, color, material, weight, smell, taste, temperature, inscriptions, and any general feel the item can give. For example, a +x weapon may feel lighter, and playing around with it may reveal it is easier to hit with it). The examination should be performed by the player and described to the DM, and the DM should describe to the player his findings.



######Example: 
**Player**: I look at the hammer. What can I see?  
*DM*: It looks like a pretty normal hammer to you at first glance, but you notice that it's a bit warmer than what you'd expect. It also has a symbol, looks like a sun, etched to its handle.  
**Player**:  coolio. I try to swing it around, maybe hit a tree or player2  
Player2: hey!  
**Player**: okay, just the tree /*rolls eyes*/  
*DM*: you swing it around and notice that it's kinda lighter than what you first thought. When you hit the tree, a small spark is visible at the contact point.  



Not every item can reveal magical properties by simple examination. Here the arcana check comes into play.  
Assuming the check was successful, the character making the check is assumed to (either through previous knowledge or through study of the item) understand most properties of the item, except for exact number of charges (general range may still be given) and command word (assuming it was not alluded to in any way in the item itself).  
Curses cannot be deduced by the check, unless the DM wants them to be known.  
If the examination wasn't performed, or the nature of the item is very hard to deduce from physical examination (up to the DM's judgment) the arcana check is done with disadvantage.  
If the nature of the item is very obvious after the examination (again, up to the DM's judgment) the check is done with advantage.  
Seeing another creature using the item might give advantage on the check, up to (you know it) the DM’s judgment.   


As an *optional rule*, failure in the arcana check may lead to the character gaining wrong information about the item.  



###Identify 

When casting this spell, you get a +10 bonus to the arcana check for identifying magic items and magical effects. You also get knowledge of the exact number of charges and of the command word (assuming any of those are relevant to the item).  
If you succeed in getting a roll of 5 more than the items DC, you may learn about curses the item bears.  
If you use the *optional rule* for wrong information, the spell makes sure no false information will be gained because of check failure.  
The spell also assists the caster in any arcana check relating to the identification of magical effects.  


*Optional rule* - to spice it up a bit, assume that using a higher spell slot for the spell gives an additional bonus to the roll.  
*Optional optional rule* - to make it more realistic, assume that in order for the spell to work better, a special material is needed - maybe one that will require a mini-quest to acquire, or just lots of money.  

*****
And that's it! hope you guys find it helpful, and I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions about it :)   

**EDIT**: Thank you all for your responses! I also added a little line about gaining advantage for the check from seeing other creatures use the item, based on u/Ilbranteloth suggestion

",1,Identifying the Problem: On Identifying Magic Items
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,29,40,"**Abstract**

There are many XP systems. I summarize those I've found after a very short unsystematic review of posts on this subreddit and then present an additional alternative. I seek feedback on the system I present and have a side objective of testing the virtue of a scientific-looking template for posts. I play D&amp;D 5e with houserules to help turn it into my vision of a power fantasy through introducing more objective challenge. My game can be described as a sandbox, with ""combat as war"" being a leading vision. 

**Introduction**

There exists many variations on the humble mechanic of rewarding experience points (XP) in adventure roleplaying games (like D&amp;D). These all fulfill different niches and work slightly different, and within mechanics GMs very frequently apply personal modifications to suit them more to their liking. 

A description of different XP systems:

---

1. The standard XP system in D&amp;D 5e is to reward XP for encounters. Encounters are defined as monsters defeated, or scenes with other challenges mapped onto the monster calculations. XP values are awarded according to a set formula based in set XP values for monsters provided in the monster manual. Alongside with this GMs are given guidelines for rewarding XP for encounters other than combat, such as social manipulation, exploration and stealth. XP is converted to levels according to a chart with variable length between levels that makes sure characters spend more time on certain levels. Advantages of this system is that it is relatively straightforward to design modules around and that it is intimately tied in with the adventuring day. Disadvantages is that it can get fiddly to deal with very variable numbers of experience points that can appear when multiplying and dividing monster XP by number of monsters vs number of party members. It can also take some time to do these calculations, making it difficult to design RAW encounters on the fly. Another downside is the potential for murder-hoboism wherein players play according to what awards XP and focuses on murdering monsters (and possible people, if they give XP) ahead of advancing plot or portraying nuanced characters. This issue can be avoided by talking with the group and agreeing that such play is less enjoyable (if that *is* what the group thinks, otherwise play on), but then the XP system is not used to its full potential as a reward mechanism. 

2. The ""Simple Experience System"" is an alternative presented for Pathfinder or D&amp;D 4e but it should work just as well for 5e. https://web.archive.org/web/20130207061017/http://www.paperspencils.com/2011/10/22/pathfinder-house-rule-simple-experience-points/.  It calculates XP needed to level by looking at suggested ""encounters to level"" and using that number x 2 as the XP threshold and awarding 2 XP for each normal-difficulty encounter. (1 XP for easy and 3 for hard). Advantages of this variation would be vastly simpler math and it being easier to award XP for encounters on the fly. Disadvantages in comparison to the standard XP system might be that it does not inherently allow for catch-up mechanics for lower level characters like the normal system (wherein lower level characters will level more often when given the same XP thanks to having smaller thresholds). By having no variation in XP thresholds between different levels it also does not differentiate how much time is spent on different levels which may slow down the very-early game and speed up the level 4-10 which many consider the *sweet spot* of play in D&amp;D 5e. It also does not solve the issue of murder-hoboism, though providing plenty of experience for other encounters heavily mitigates the motivation to be a murder hobo. (Given a proper job and a home a murder hobo can show themselves to be a productive citizen). 

3. An official variation to the standard XP system is the Unearthed Arcana Three Pillar Experience. It is similar to the ""Simple XP System"" but is based on a scale of 100 XP instead of # of average encounters between levels. Challenges grant set XP values independent of the objective level of the encounter, the values instead being based on the relative difficulty for the party. Guidelines are provided for what challenges or events should provide experience. Advantages are similar to the simple experience system, but allowing for slightly more granularity. Downsides are slighly more crunch. A more significant downside can be the lack of structure that can leave players feeling lost if they do not know what will give XP, as can happen if the GM is arbitrary in what they consider a challenge of a certain difficulty. A slightly more nuanced discussion and some variation on the system can be found in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9vzsn6/a_discussion_of_xp_and_my_homebrew_xp_system/.

4. The main alternative XP system provided in the DMG is the milestone XP system. It is based on the GM determining milestones in the story of the campaign and telling the players when they've reached the milestones and that they level up. Advantages of this system is that it can encourage players to follow a storyline or story beats planted by the GM wich helps form a more cohesive plot experience. It's also very easy to manage, requiring little work in addition to preparing story beats that might be done either way. Downsides of this alternative is that it deprives players of direct motivations to do stereotypic adventurer activities like delving into unkown dungeons, fighitng monsters, saving random people and the like. If the players aren't aware of the milestone they are working towards they may also feel lost and bereft of direction, which may be a bad feeling. 

5. A significant variation of the milestone based XP system is the ""Quest XP"" proposed by u/aseigo in their post https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ar8ftc/quest_experience_a_streamlined_leveling_mechanic/. There they provide guidelines for how milestones may be broken up into ""Quest points"" that are ""big"" XP points awarded for specific ""achievements"" that are like smaller milestones. The achievements are, like milestones, primarily planned ahead of time and conveyed to the players through 'immersive narration' by the GM to give stronger hints at what direction characters should move in. Advantages of this system is that it, like milestone XP, can freely reward a variety of play-goals and isn't limited to the three pillars of combat, exploration and interaction. Downsides are that it requires slightly more preparation than milestone XP, and that players if not properly aware of achievements might end up feeling lost for direction. 

6. Session based XP is the second alternative XP system in the DMG. Characters level up when they (or the party, if no difference in character level is wanted) have attendend a set number of sessions. This system can follow a pattern of a certain number of sessions needed between each level that mimics the expected time using the standard XP system. Advantages of this system is ease of use. It can be done easily with minimal calculation, and a variation allows the GM to just level up the party whenever they feel like it. Downsides are that raising levels are decoupled from in-world actions and thus can't help serve as a motivation or even a reward for players. The reward is for attendence (or for being part of the group, if XP is given even to absent players), which fails to utilize the strong mechanic that is XP. The benefits of this alternative is mainly it's lack of any side effect on account of barely having any inherent effect. 

7. XP for gold is a system as old as the game itself. It follows the simple formula of awarding characters with 1 XP per 1 gold they loot from the dungeon. This system was created for dungeon level play and fares poorly if applied straight to any gold taken, making merchant rather than adventurer the optimal class for levelling (since it's far safer to sit at home buying and selling than it is to delve dungeons but also far less interesting). The system thus usually comes with the caveat that gold need to be found in and brought back from a dungeon and that gold can only be counted for XP once. Advantages of this system is that it encourages more stereotypical adventurer behaviour like raiding dungeons, as well as smart play that avoids encounters and plays around the resource-depletion minigame that is D&amp;D HP and spell slots. It also rewards an intuitive motivation for all characters, to get filthy rich. Concrete goals for all characters helps spur players to action which creates drama and interesting situations which is especially useful in a sandbox game. Downsides is that it is often considered unintuitive at a glance. One character learning more abilities for overcoming the same dungeon as another just because they found more gold or other treausure seems wrong. It only works as a meausure of ""adventurer skill"" when considered over a long time span. Another downside is that it limits what treausure a GM can give a party from a balanced standpoint. Lest they want to accidentally level the party multiple levels they can't give out a huge treausure hoard. It also makes it difficult to motivate the party to partake in quests that does not produce profit, as such activities are less likely to provide lootable gold. Rewarding XP for some gold but not other gold may end up feeling arbitrary and unfair for the players and make it difficult to know what they should be working towards. 

8. XP for spending gold on carousing is a significant addition to the XP-for-gold system that encourages characters to deplete their treasure instead of hoarding it or making investments, assuring that the motivation to get filthy rich makes narrative sense.

9. Character trait/goal based XP is a system ported over from other rpgs. (Here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9vzsn6/a_discussion_of_xp_and_my_homebrew_xp_system/e9hf2xu/] u/Chaddric70 summarizes Adam Koebel's method of granting players 50 x their level in XP when they work towards their goal, their goal being what they told him in secret at the beginning of the session. In the same thread u/Dannnnv (mentions)[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9vzsn6/a_discussion_of_xp_and_my_homebrew_xp_system/e9hg6p6/] a similar system from Marvel RPG wherein characters come with explicit set goals worth different amounts of XP that they are rewarded for working towards and/or completing. Here u/Spyger9 describes how a goal-based system is used to reward Inspiration (while using a variation of the ""Simple Experience System"" for XP). Advantages of these systems is that provide explicit goals for player to play towards while encouraging character representation through roleplaying. They also offload some crunch from the GM by making players track when they should be awarded with experience. They are also generally relatively simple and fast to use. Downsides are that the system may feel too subjective wherein players must decide not to play optimally in order to not make their goals as easy as possible as that would make play less dramatic and intersting. They are also more dependent on players being invested and formulating good goals in order for the game to be really interesting. Uninspired goals can lead to uninspired play. By default the system would also lead to unequal character levels, unless everyone is rewarded for anyone's actions which similarly to other ""XP for attending"" systems reduces the power of XP to serve as motivation. Some also feel that these system make RP more difficult as they must think about XP and other meta currencies while they roleplay rather than just being able to immerse themselves in the game.

10. Direct DM-adjucated level advancement (or ""No XP system"") was suggested by u/Ilbranteloth (in this thread)[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/avxhdy/reviewing_xp_systems_and_proposing_an_alternative/ehj9igw/]. It's based on the GM using their best judgement to determine when characters level up. Advantages is that it allows a more naturalistic and adaptable levelling up rythm and easy corraboration with the input from players. Downsides is that it, like the XP-for-attendance system described above, does not provide players a source of external motiavtion and thus doesn't serve much of a purpose. Its qualities will be entirely dependent on the nature of the level system, for good and bad. 

---

It is on the base of these XP systems that I present my alternative, that I consider novel and significantly different from previous options. 

I recently started a campaign with the expressed goal of testing a number of house rules, and to generally test out the sandbox playstyle. Among these houserules are a makeover of XP. I started out with XP-for-treausure but was disappointed with having to micro-manage awarded treasure to not deprive my players of experiencing certain levels. One adventure had quite a hefty treausure as a reward which levelled them from level 2 to level 4 only 30 minutes after they'd finished levelling up from level 1. 

An innate part of the style I've chosen to play in is the party rules. I allow each player multiple concurrent characters, but each character is rewarded XP individually and new characters start at around level 1 (dependant on future balancing mechanics). This will be a very significant change to the normal gameplay wherein character lives are rather cheap and levels often fail to feel like achievements. By removing the guarantee to reach higher levels I hope to challenge my players and allow them to feel proud about their advances. Additional characters are more akin to extra lives, though roleplay will still be a central part of the game on the virtue of it being its own reward. I believe this playstyle to possibly be the one D&amp;D is best suited for by its nature as an enabler of power fantasies. I recognize that power fantasies are best when the player can feel truly powerful which they do after overcoming real challenges rather than illusory threats. In short, I introduce the old type of true ""game over"" wherein you must start over from level 1-1, as a way to raise the stakes. I mitigate it by allowing multiple characters.

Naturally a good XP system will be quite important for my game. Searching for other ideas for XP systems I stumbled across an osr blog that described what I call ""Achievement-XP"". I unfortunately can't seem to find the blog, but know that I'm but a fraud working with others' ideas. The blog described a system wherein character earned 1/2 a level's worth of XP each time they performed an achievement from a list of achievements. Things like ""Help a town of 2000+ people overcome something that troubles it"" and ""Defeat a legendary monster"". There was also a list of XP-items that could only be achieved once in a PC's career. Things like ""See a marvelous thing (like the birth of a god)"" and ""Train 3 followers until they gain a level"". Presenting the system for my players, they pointed out that it made it difficult to level in the early game and far to easy in the late game (when you could defeat more than one legendary monster a day). Based on that criticism I shifted the system to only have ""Once-per-career""-achievements and found that I had a novel system in my hands.

Thus I present to you list of once-per-career achievements. They are a first draft and roughly based on my home game, but I hope the concept is conveyed.


**The mechanic**

The players know of the list, and cross off options as they achieve them. Each option gives 1/2 a level's worth of XP counted as the average level of the characters in the party eligible for the award or the level of the character who recieves the award (depending on if it's an individual reward or not). The standard XP table is used, so a low level character partaking in the slaying of a legendary monster with high level characters who still have that option unchecked will gain potentially enough XP to level multiple times. Unless stated otherwise, each option is rewarded only once

Once during a PC’s career, they gain 1⁄2 a level’s worth of XP when they… 

* Become famous in a town (be famous in the capital for another).

* Resolve a situation scourging a town or more’s worth of people (2000+). Resolve one scourging a Country for another.

* Slay a famous monster (CR 10 for one, CR 15 for another, CR 20 for a third and last).

* Slay a person in cold blood. (Kill a completely innocent being for another).

* Foil the plans of a powerful villain well enough to permanently stop those plans.

* Become a local champion (Be recognized as the best in the kingdom for another).

* Reveal a dangerous or shocking secret publicly.

* Be infamous among the dominant culture of a region.

* Stop a wicked social custom in a region (Stop it everywhere for another).

* Sway the pillar of a town (2000+ population) of their strongest conviction (Sway a soverign for another).

* Obtain an official title with real powers and responsibility from a powerful government.

* Make an ally of a powerful foe.

* Betray a long-time ally.

* Make a lifelong enemy of a powerful foe (Exact revenge on them for another).

* Discover an ancient artifact (Discover a world-changing artifact, enchantment or secret for another half-level each).

* Blow 1,000 SP or more on a single bout of carousing and gallivanting (Blow 10,000 SP for another, and 100,000 SP for even another).

* Recover a treasure worth 1000 SP (a priceless one for another).

* Steal 1000 SP worth of goods in a single heist.

* Swear allegiance truthfully to a mentor or patron.

* Train at least 3 followers or apprentices until they gain a level (Guide at least one to level 5 for another, and level 10 for a third).

* Make something lasting like a book, a castle, a town or a magical artifact (Have the thing be famous for another. Have the thing be used by someone important for a third).

* Survive an event that slays everyone else in the party.

* Assemble an astounding library, trophy case, or tomb to commemorate your deeds.

* Behold an incredible sight never to be seen again. (Up to three times)

* Fly on a dragon’s back.

* Spend 6 months without ever touching the ground.

* Sail the undersea.

* Perform in front of a massive crowd.

* Die.

* Reach your afterlife.

* Are worshipped as a god by those who were once your peers.



**The reasoning**

The set list of achievements known to the players I hope will provide enough of an engine to fuel much adventure-filled play initiated by the players rather than any plot of GM-origin. By being once-per-career they mark a path that all characters must take while allowing the specific route and circumstances of each character to vary. No two paths to level 20 are likely to be the same. 

The general idea is to have a balance of combat, exploration and interaction achievements to support all three pillars of play. As it stands no one can level all the way to 20 using only one pillar, but there should be enough posts to avoid a single pillar. I feel this is roughly a nice balance as each character will be an adventurer who still will need to do adventuring activities. Someone who only explores is an explorer, but someone who explores and fights is an adventurer. Someone who only fights is a warrior, but someone who fights and sings is an adventurer. **It is vital that the number of achievements is kept in check to balance the ""boosting"" effect of a low level adventurer tagging along with high level adventurers.

I have included some obviously immoral options, to help make the choice of what goal to work against more exciting. Betraying the party is an option, but is a poor choice given how most of the options are easier to do in a group (such as slaying a legendary beast, or delving dungeons to find ancient artifacts) which will be more difficult with a group of adventurers hunting your hide. Likewise, allowing XP for murder allows good paladins and the like to gloat in how superior they are for not falling to the temptation while facing more difficult challenges because of it (which helps make the game feel more real, since it alludes to how evil and good work in real life. Evil is easy). 

My expectation is that players will still want to do thing like quests on account of them often leading to XP-granting events and in-game rewards that make the characters mightier. I also hope that regular roleplay will prevail and that characters will act in accordance with their own goals. I'm considering adding mechanics to help support this, but it will likely depend on how play ends up looking.


**Questions**

What achievements do you think are missing from the list?

What achievements might end up being more trouble than they're worth?

How would you improve on this mechanic?


**Additional thoughts**

What do you think of the posting format? I tried to very roughly mimic the outline of scientific papers to make it easier to parse. 

This was not a systematic review of XP systems and I am bound to have missed some variations. Feel free to complete it in the comments and make a new refined post aggregating additional knowledge. 

Additionally, many of the systems mentioned in the introduction are by no means exclusive to each other and can could be combined systematically to create tailored experiences.

Today I would like to give some tips on handling larger groups, and how you can make the experience fun for everyone.



#Herding the Cats

The most difficult aspect of handling larger groups is that they can be rowdy. When there are 6+ people all talking over each other it can be very difficult to keep anyone focused on the game at hand. With groups this large you may even start to see multiple side conversations, and instead of the game being one conversation between the DM and the players, it's chaos. Fortunately, there are ways to combat this issue.

Keeping people from talking over each other is one of my primary goals when I am handling a larger group. Quiet players can be drowned out very easily and you will have multiple players asking ""what happened?"" every time it comes back to their turn if multiple people are talking over each other all the time. You can fix this by giving players initiative outside of combat. Go in a circle around the table and ask each player what they are doing. This gives them a mini spotlight and lets them tell everybody what they are doing with no one talking over them. If other people do start to talk over the player, ask them to be quiet and give the player their spotlight. 



#Giving them Chores

Another problem that larger groups may have is players not staying engaged with the game. When it takes a half hour to get to your turn only for you to swing and miss, it's understandable that players will get distracted and disengaged. This is bad though because when it finally does come back to their turn, they will be lost and will need you to reexplain the situation. To solve this problem you need to keep them engaged when it isn't their turn, and you can do this by giving them chores such as tracking initiative. Not only does this keep the players on track, but it also helps you to stay focused. Here are some examples of chores the players can do:

Tracking Initiative and calling out who is on deck (""Baltair it's your turn, Ava you're up next"")
A designated rules lawyer (""What does Fairie Fire do again?"")
Battlemap artist (""Who wants the marker?"")
Official mini-mover (""I can't reach Tiamat, please don't put her in the lava"")
Notetaker (""Did I really name him bipple-baggle-bottoms?"")
Music player (""Stop playing Never Gonna Give You Up or so help me"")
Distributor of wealth (""I'll have the glowy sword and you can keep the copper pieces"")
Another thing that I should mention is that once you get to a large enough party size, you should always use a battle map and minis. I'm a big fan of theater of the mind, but having something you can quickly look at to refresh your memory is an invaluable asset to have with a big group.

#Combat in Large Groups

With this many players, challenging the party starts to become difficult. Big ogres that are meant to be intimidating and scary could roll bad at initiative once and be pulverized before they can even move. Unless your players are all brand new to Dnd, one thing I would recommend is throwing higher challenge ratings at them. Dnd players are extremely crafty folk and can come up with ways to win encounters you may deem as unbeatable. Another thing you should do is give the bad guys more actions. You can do this by either giving the big bad monster legendary actions or by introducing a bunch of minions that move independently of the big monster. (You should also give them an auto-20 on initiative just to be safe). 

Finally, one of the most important things you need to do with a large group is to keep combat moving fast. If it takes a half hour for a turn to go around the table your players will lose interest faster than a sinking Galeb Duhr. Impose a time limit on turns and have them default to a dodge action if they can't come up with something in 15-45 seconds. Make your players plan their turn before it becomes their turn, and keep things moving along at a fast pace. It should only take 3-5 minutes to move around a table with as many as 8 people as long as everything is going according to plan. 

I'd recommend reading /u/OrkishBlade's ""[Keeping Combat Short and to the Point](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3v4wwh/keeping_combat_short_and_tothepoint/)"". It is an excellent article detailing how to run combat simply and effectively and should be helpful for anyone, not just DM's who have larger groups. 



#Conclusion

DMing large groups is hard. Don't feel bad if you need to turn players away or split the group in half. You can even try out a West Marches style of campaign! But if you don't want to do that, there are plenty of ways to make the game feasible no matter how many players you try to cram at your table. Keeping them focused and engaged is important. Don't let the players talk over each other. Give them chores to keep them focused when it's not their turn. Keep combat fast and to the point, and finally, don't hold back on your monsters. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,7,51,"I'm sure I am not alone as a DM, when you know someone who would be absolutely *fabulous* as a roleplayer, but whether for scheduling issues, attention span, or lack of interest in general you just can't entice them to your table. But if you can't wear them down, there's another way to include them in the fun to the benefit of everyone: have them play a Cameo NPC!

For illustration and bragging purposes, I'll use my own example of inviting my wife to join our game and play the role of a bookstore owner. 

 
&amp;nbsp;

**The Prep**

Your Cameo doesn't need to know anything silly like the rules of the game, or the stories of your players, or read 3 years of old session notes. Think of it as a walk-on bit character on TV, all they need to know is their character's traits, a few key backstory anecdotes, and whatever information they're there to feed to your players. 

After securing their (perhaps reluctant) agreement to participate, spend an hour just riffing with your Cameo, let them participate in the character design as much as possible. Do they have a fun voice or accent they want to use? A popular TV or book character as a reference? What does the character do for a living? What's their name? 

In the case of my wife, she jumped at the chance to play a Paula Deen type, and came up with a wonderful name: Guinevere Shepherd. She heads a secret human-supremist cell in her basement, a la Hot Fuzz (Which every good DM should watch) - ""The Greater Good"", intro'ing secret cabal meetings with local news, a sweet southern belle with a deadly secret. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The KPIs**

While I suggest letting the Cameo own their character as much as possible, they still need to be grounded in the setting and deliver their key points. Why are the players going to be there? What secrets does the Cameo have, and how closely should they guard it? You may need to provide them with a list of key names of organizations or important NPCs, or even set up an easy to follow script for when certain keystone situations occur. 

In the case of Guinevere Shepherd, she knew that she ran the ""Transportation District chapter of the Right Hand"", she had an anecdote, ""Thank you for all your petitions to the Estate agency, we finally got those orcs kicked out of town"", and to start engaging the players by asking, ""Philbert who are your guests?""

&amp;nbsp;

**The Engagement**

This is where it all comes together. If you're playing online it's easiest, as you simply have the Cameo stand by for when it's time to dial in. Physical games may be harder, you could still have them just call in over the phone, or if possible have them nearby. Whatever you do try to keep it a secret from the players! The best part of this whole thing is your players are used to negotiating with *you,* no matter how good you are at RP, and suddenly having to negotiate, threaten, or otherwise engage with a real whole other person is the most glorious headtrip I've delivered as a DM yet. 

You'll need to have confidence with your Cameo's ability to play their role and improvise on the spot. You still run the game - if they make a passable lie have the player roll Deception and simply tell the Cameo the result, i.e. ""This guy seems reliable,"" ""that was total bullshit"" etc. If they get stuck offer guidance, either texting or communicating in secret, or giving context or narration like you normally would as DM - keep the action going and don't let people sit down and think, and aim for no more than 10-20 minutes so you don't wear the Cameo out too much.

Same with keeping the players in the dark, maybe restrict some info to the Cameo as well for truly authentic roleplaying. For instance, with Guinevere one of the players was an elf in disguise, but I didn't warn her of that earlier so she wasn't specifically looking out for a non-human infiltrator. 


&amp;nbsp;

**The Climax**

You need to end such an epic encounter with a bang for both your players and your Cameo! After all, you're entertaining both parties, and you owe your Cameo as memorable an experience as your players. Without railroading too much, have some epic endings for your encounter planned, whether positive or disastrous. Don't let your Cameo in on it too much, but set up the situation enough to ""make sure"" things go your way. If combat breaks out, run the Cameo's fight for them, but let them provide the wit and quips. 

With Guinevere, all I told her was, ""If it gets dangerous, you have a special gem that you throw on the ground, a gift from the Right Hand if things get out of hand."" And indeed, one of the players ended up being too cagey and suspicious (he wanted to ""walk his dog"" and leave after she told them her secret plan). So she started freaking out and finally threw the gem on the ground! Turns out it was an Elemental Gem, and all the human supremists were immediately immolated, leaving the players in an on-fire bookstore with a fire elemental  and 4 corpses in the middle of the city in the middle of the night. The shock on her face - and on the rest of the table - was oh so very precious!",1,"The Cameo NPC, or how to play nice with others"

----------------------------

# Introduction

Sahuagin are not a new threat to any seaside location, however with expansion and the founding of a new city specifically for trade a risk assessment includes the Sahuagin.  A wise decision.  My task is not to assess the risk of attack in this region but to provide all possible information on the Sahuagin as part of that task.

--------------------------

# Sahuagin Physiology 

----------------------------

## Origins of Sahuagin

The ""fishmen"", as many humans call them, are a very old people that have existed probably as long as the dragons.  Sahuagin are indeed descendants of fish but much in the same way humanoids are from apes, a common ancient ancestor.  Records etched in under-sea ruins date back to early events regarded as ancient in the oldest elvish records.  Their civilizations have been thriving hidden from land walkers for much longer than we can imagine.

------------------------------

## Physical Aesthetics of the Sahuagin

As they are often called ""fishmen"" Sahuagin are extremely fish-like in appearance.  A bipedal and large-eyed humanoid with webbed hands and feet.  Unlike Kuo-tao they are more upright in posture with much more humanoid shaped heads.  Each Sahuagin has a dorsal fin that starts somewhere on their head and then dissipates at the neck to re-emerge on their back.  Each dorsal fin is unique in size, structure, color, and positioning as a mark of individualism.  Females will tend to have fins on top of their head and on the sides parallel to each other while males will tend to have perpendicular facial fins.

Coloration is dependant on the sub-species (or race) of the Sahuagin.  The most commonly known Sahuagin, the Tide Callers, will be cyan to green in coloration with darker green scales as accent colors.  More exotic varieties can have more vibrant colors, especially in tropical regions.  Most often Sahuagin are colored closely to the common sea foliage of their homes for better camouflage as predators from prey.

-------------------------------------

## Not so Fast Swimmers for Fish-Folk

Being a sea creature they are not the fastest or even moderately fast swimmers.  Like most marine creatures they have webbed feet and hands to aid in swimming but their posture isn't built for speed.  They are instead built for endurance much in the way a human or dwarf is for running.  They will eventually hunt down fleeing prey and spear them for a meal.  However, as with many societies, they have found advancements to overcome their lack of speed into the fauna of the surrounding environment.  Most often and the easiest boost in speed is the riding of other sea creatures, whether it be Sharks, Giant Seahorses, Whales, Serpents, and other creatures.

Aside from riding other creatures Sahuagin also have a few methods of transportation.  They have created their own ""air Jet"" technology where shells of pressurized air are strapped to their backs for bursts of speed that can quadruple their swim speed for hundreds of yards.  They also have devised vehicles running on the technology with a more controlled release for quicker yet more sustained movement.  These vehicles are crafted of sea-shells and other large shelled creature remains.  However, the process of creating and storing such large amounts of pressurized air is difficult and usually not common in smaller communities. 

-----------------------------------------

## Excellent Distorted Sight

As it may seem odd Sahuagin can see better than many creatures underwater.  They are not only able to drastically and quickly adjust to various light levels as present in the deep waters they inhabit but also can see almost as far as an elf on a clear day on the surface.  This is a rare ability to be able to see this well in the ocean and this gives them many advantages in both attack and defense during a confrontation.  However, this ability does have its drawbacks.  They are woefully blind outside of water but not due to blurriness or other common side effects but they perceive more movement than what actually is present.  While they can spot an eagle in the sky it seems to move erratically horizontally constantly.  

Just as humanoids often wear some sight apparatus to go into the water, Sahuagins have surfacing goggles.  These goggles are sealed tight with water to keep their vision behind a lense of water and able to accurately discern their surroundings in a visual sense.

---------------------------------------

## Carnivores

Sahuagin are exclusively carnivorous and mostly prey upon squid, octopus, and mollusks as a diet.  They will eat fish or shark if need be but it can have digestive problems for them if they consume too much.  Whales and even Krakens are considered a high delicacy although how they are able to obtain Kraken meat is beyond my understanding.  Unusually for any carnivore, they are completely unable to process plant food.  Most carnivores supplement some plant material mostly for digestive purposes but even small amounts of a plant can be ejected from their digestive tract violently.

--------------------------------------

## Habitat and Home

Sahuagin are usually shallow water dwellers that live in communities with various hollowed out cave homes.  While natural caves are convenient most often these are crafted caves in the bedrock to serve as dwellings.  Even natural ones are heavily modified to fit their purposes.  The home consists of usually 3 rooms, a sleeping chamber, a social chamber, and a brood chamber, in the best translations we have.  While each room sounds self-explanatory the sleeping chamber is actually where they are the most of the time at home.  This serves as both a bedroom and an entertainment room as they will stay here when not out or entertaining company with the various research, toys, or even writing that Sahuagin takes part in.  They are very solitary creatures.  Brood chambers are literally there to hatch their dozens of eggs and nothing more.  The social quarters are there for meeting with other Sahuagin but for most are rarely used.

------------------------------------

## Life Cycle

Sahuagin are born of eggs in broods of about 15 siblings.  From hatching, they are not as helpless as a human baby or elf but socially wild and unfit.  Thus any new hatchlings are almost immediately removed for schooling moments after emerging.  The child will stay in the Schooling until they reach adulthood and are able to join their society.  Schooling consists of not just social skills but combat, magic, technology, and even high academics and arts.  Knowledge is power to a Sahuagin but they don't sacrifice the body for it.

For their total lifespan, Sahuagins only live to be about 40 years old.  There are accounts of individuals living on into their 60's but most are so degraded by age they are virtually dead anyway.  With these shorter life-spans, they do mature much quicker than other races and reach full-adulthood by 5 years of age.  With only 5 years of learning not just about society, but also combat and other studies much of what they learn is from experience or further classes after adulthood.

-----------------------------------------------------

## Cold Blooded Fish

Sahuagin are definitely cold-blooded creatures.  They can operate in many cold regions of the word as long as the ice itself doesn't freeze.  Once leaving the water though they are unable to keep the water in them from freezing and will succumb to lower or higher temperatures.  They are not discomforted by this phenomenon as they completely lack a concept of heat.  Thus most are unaware of the damaging effects of fire.  

These aquatic humanoids also have the extraordinary ability to survive being frozen.  In fact, there are no ill effects of being frozen and simply live in a suspended state until thawed.  This ability isn't used all too often but it's important to note if freezing a Sahuagin is the plan to dispatch of them, you've chosen the wrong plan.

-----------------------------------------------------

# Social Interactions and Intelligence

------------------------------------

## Intelligence

Sahuagin are a highly advanced and intelligent society.  Not only do they have higher concepts such as math and art but they are also well versed in their own ways of philosophy and research into other civilizations.  Each Sahuagin is schooled on many subjects as previously mentioned and it's easily seen that better schooling works on a large scale.  Unlike many human cities, most every Sahuagin is fully schooled and well rounded intelligently.  The effects of both academic and battle knowledge are well reflected in how dangerous even a single Sahuagin can be to an inexperienced individual.  The most intelligent Sahuagin could rival that of the greatest wizards in history, although this is pure speculation since we know so little of their full capabilities.

-------------------------------------------

## Language and Communication

Sahuagin all speak their own language, which we have called Sahuagin for now.  They are also normally versed in languages such as Kuo-tao, merfolk, and many other aquatic life languages.  They normally won't be able to communicate with surface dwellers but they can indeed learn the language.  Their language is not purely verbal in fact it's more about motion and body language than verbal components as the ability to communicate verbally underwater is quite different under the sea.  

Sahuagin are also usually able to communicate with dolphins, whales, and other mammals quite easily.  Sharks seem to listen to them also but I suspect this is much more manipulation of the shark's electrical sense more so than true conversation.  Sharks seem to have no quandary eating an unsuspecting Sahuagin.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Cold Blooded Order

Sahuagin are highly intelligent but intelligence doesn't necessarily make them peaceful or on the side of Good.  Sahuagin are extremely evil to the point they wish to dominate all civilization and submerge all known existence in water and thus their rule.  They are also bastions of order to the point of almost minute details of life dictated by law.  Their dominion over their own people is enough to be wary of a Sahuagin occupation.  The whole of Sahuagin society is one empire ruled by a King and Queen with Lords governing specific areas.  THey stretch the empire as far as they can, safely, setting up borders and strict agreements with neighboring societies.  These warnings can be found on their borders condemning unwelcomed guests as prisoners or criminals to be executed on site.

Eventually, they attempt to expand those borders with large scale wars or even quick attacks of smaller targets.  These confrontations are not with many warnings but can almost be assured with time.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Kings, Queens, and Lords

The ruling family of Sahuagin is very old and from what we can tell the only ruling family to exist.  The utmost importance of law and order has facilitated a completely loyal kingdom with little discord for change.  The Lords, on the other hand, can change and have, with everything being governed by blood lines some Lordships have been completely eradicated in conflicts with outside civilizations or instituted with deeds to aid the royal family.

The royal family is revered as the highest order and looked up to by most individuals.  It seems that jealousy is only for creatures outside of their society.  Not many Sahuagin have grabbed for more power outside of their station but serve dutifully and completely as they can.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Family and neighbors

Despite being cruel and outright evil creatures to others within the Sahuagin they are actually kind and caring.  Their family is the most important thing to a Sahuagin and they will die willingly, regardless of capability to defend themselves, to aid the family.  They are also very attached to their neighbors and other community members.  Close connections are made with other Sahuagin that last their whole lifetime.  

Sahuagin are not monogamous creatures despite family.  Females typically own a cave in which the Males will have as many families they frequent as they can handle.  Despite the birth-rate of a 50/50 split between male and female, males usually die much earlier in life due to battle.  While many females participate in battle they are most often the caregivers and teachers once they have a clutch of eggs.  Usually, a female will only have 3 to 4 clutches in their life-span, but they will aid and help other mothers in the community long after their own children have moved on.  Royalty and the Lords have the distinction of having a stable family of 2 parents and usually only 1 clutch.  This is more of a station thing as some Sahuagin have ignored the standards and still had many clutches.

------------------------------------------

## Succession of Rule

For both Royalty and Lordship usually the family head or center is considered the mother.  When the mother dies it is the youngest daughter in the family, even if many generations removed from the current Queen, that succeeds the crown and whoever she chooses as her life-long mate.  This choice is entirely involuntary to the male.  Despite such an alien concept of accepted duty to humans such as myself, I have found no records of refusal by males of this station.  This is also an interesting concept showing that as a society they value the opinions of young children very highly.  This drastic changing of the guard may make them far more adaptable than the slow progression we see in many familiar societies.  

--------------------------------------------

## Mated Partners

As mentioned a male will have more than one mate on most occasions.  These bonds are always initiated by females that harbor no jealousy towards shared males.  While this may be a result of more males being killed than females it does create situations of males never having a mate.  These free-roaming males don't seem to have any attachments and are usually the best warriors.  The reasoning as to why is only a supposition at this point but I would guess as the free-time is spent training rather than caregiving between conflict.

---------------------------------------------------------

# Interactions with Other Creatures

-------------------------------------

## Kuo-Tao

Sahuagin and the Kuo-Tao are far from allies in their submerged environments.  Where the Sahuagin despise land dwellers it pales in comparison to the Ugly Ones in rough translation.  Both are creatures of an evil-nature thus the battles are unforgiving and brutal.  While there are such things as neighboring communities you can guarantee that the Sahuagin's next place of interest is either the Kuo-Tao communities or a tactical advantage against them.  Wars have never actually ceased between the 2 fish people and are constantly in conflict even if on a small scale.

-------------------------------

## Surface Dwellers

Sahuagin are Xenophobic as can be and the land dwellers are a large part of that hate for other beings.  Sahuagins believe themselves the rightful owners of all existence and consider weak air breathers too cowardly to submit to their rule.  Many times the Sahuagin will conduct service raids on coastal town and settlements only to eradicate the town.  No valuables are ever taken, no supplies, just wholesale slaughter down to the last living mouse.  Sahuagin find Humans to be the easiest prey and consider their tactics with other races more carefully.  This has led to an interesting trend to stage false human communities only to be countered and ransacked by allied Elves or Dwarves.

-------------------------------------------------

## Sharks and other Sea Life

Much of the animals living in the sea the Sahuagin are fond of and even somewhat in tune with.  They are however not caring humanoids and show little affection even to life-long mounts.  This feeling is noticed by druids as an unrequited bond usually with the sharks, some of the most cold-hearted animals, feeling quite empty when connected to a Sahuagin.  Dolphins will toy with and even chat with a Sahuagin but often a dolphin will not ally themselves with Sahuagin willingly.  Usually, if dolphin riders are present it is by force or coercion.  

------------------------------------------

## Merfolk and other Sentient Aquatic Races

Sahuagin do not foster open hatred for many aquatic creatures and even merfolk among them.  They do consider themselves superior in almost all ways though and treat any other creatures with severe disrespect and coldness.  Merfolk usually just simply avoid the Sahuagin although more feisty groups have engaged themselves with the empire.  Sahuagin are more than happy to quell any such threats.

---------------------------------------------------

## Battle Tactics

Sahuagin are experts in combat and depending on their training they can take many roles.  From fighters to mages to even sneaky scouts, Sahuagin forces are varied with many specialized roles.  Each one plays their part in a battle and with great effect.

Overall Sahuagins are straightforward and unified attackers Usually forming what they call the casted net formation with attackers from above, below, and to the sides much closer and forward attackers hanging back, much like a net being thrown at a target.  This 3-dimensional look at the battlefield is not uncommon for underwater fights and quite effective against those caught unaware.  Usually, they lead in with tridents, small stabbing swords, and nets.  All extremely effective weapons in the water.

Below are the various tactics based on the type of warrior:

* **Scouts** are much like the rouge or specialist types we see in the seedier side of surface communities.  Relying on speed, stealth, and attacking the weak points quickly the scouts are dangerous when left unattended.

* **Soldiers** are straight forward attackers usually with spears, tridents, and nets.  Effective at both corraling and facing foes face to face.

* **Mages** are some of the most dangerous as they can hang back and sling deadly spells behind the safety of their comrades.  Unlike mages in the surface world, they are also expected to be well versed in physical self-defense.  While not nearly as efficient as a warrior they are still not to be underestimated toe to fin.

* **Archers** while ranged weapons are rarer due to the nature of water there are air propulsion bows and harpoons carried by archers.  Newly trained units mostly and not very common they can be deadly from much further than even mages at times.  However, they do often lack the tools necessary for a face to face confrontation due to the heavy load of their gear.

* **Royalty** with the exception of archery each member of the Royal family is not only expected to be able to fill any roll in combat but to be the best at or excel.  Royalty spends most of their life either in study or training with a little luxury in their life.  This makes for formidable leaders in their words.

--------------------------------------------

# Variations of Sahuagin

-----------------------------------

## Coastal Reef Dwellers

Usually greenish to blue in color these are the most common Sahuagin in the empire.  They are often favored as soldiers and almost always the only ones to go on a surface raid.  Standing well over 6 feet tall they are strong and imposing figures even on land.  However, even with breathing gear, they will not last for more than a few hours outside of their ocean homes.

------------------------

## Deep Sea Hunters

Darker Black to Blue in color they are hunters of the abyss.  With their own bioluminescence, there are quite possibly the rarest of their kind.  They hunt the great depths for large game such as whales, sea serpents, and other monstrous creatures.  Usually wielding spears and javelins they are excellent trackers sometimes used in night raids.  They are only around 5 feet tall and have larger eyes that shine green.

-----------------------------

## Sea Cave Scouts

Brown in color and only about 3 feet tall they are the spelunkers trying to find their ways into the underground waterways connected to the oceans.  Usually not around for long and avoiding confrontation the Sea Cave Scouts are quite possibly the closest to human societies and the least known of or seen.  They are adept at hiding and usually carry small stabbing weapons like daggers or swords to protect themselves.  Most often they are in small teams and even sometimes a family of spelunkers going into caves and establishing networks to the empire.

-----------------

## Coral defenders

More vibrantly colored and in the tropical regions to the empire, the Coral Defenders are extremely territorial menaces to ships.  Most often seen attacking boats too close to coral reefs they are in a way protecting them but not truly for the altruism and safety of the reef.  Instead, the rough terrain makes the ships easy prey the boarding Sahuagin to eradicate more air breathers and they say.  The Royal family are actually Coral Defenders most notably bright Red and Orange in hue.  Usually, this kind is of the average size of 6 feet but the Royal family regularly reach 8 to 9 feet tall.

-------------------------------------------------

# DM's Notes

Most DM's shy away from water combat and thus really only use Sahuagin as surface raiders on coastal settlements.  This not a bad way to go about things but for the more adventurous type, a romp through a hostile empire in the ocean can make for a great adventure.  Keep in mind that Sahuagins are an intelligent race and not mindless fish people to raid a town.

Ex: ""*You flip the coin and suddenly get thrown into a spin, by the time you get your balance again you notice your teammates laughing at you grabbing their sides and slapping their knees.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The Coin of the Pickpocket-** A gold coin that is uniquely light. When a user attempts to pickpocket a person, they may choose to swap the coin with their stated target (cannot be armor or clothing) to get advantage on the action. Any attempt to pickpocket this coin must happen at disadvantage.

Ex: ""*You hold up the coin to the pocket of the Duke, as you go to put it in the pocket you are startled to notice it has disappeared from your hand; in its place, the key to the cellar.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The Coin of the Prospector-** A gold coin that is uniquely heavy and glints an odd purple. When an individual's saliva touches the coin, the person must make a CON save of 13 at disadvantage. If they fail they are immobilized until the saliva either dries or someone removes the coin from their mouth (in the they put it there).

Ex: ""*You hand the coin over to the man behind the counter, confused as to its odd properties the clerk bites the coin to ensure its authenticity. Suddenly he stops moving, eyes darting but otherwise motionless.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The Coin of the Gambler-** (EDIT 2: collaborated with [u/DaddyLittlePrincess8](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaddyLittlePrincess8) ) A silver coin that rests on its side when on a flat surface. An attuned user of the coin, upon its use, must declare the full course of their intended action for the next turn and then, as a bonus action, it can be flipped caught, and placed flat on the back of one's hand. The coin will show either heads or tail. Heads gives the user advantage on their declared action. Tails gives disadvantage on their declared action. The user cannot opt to not take their declared course of action, as their destiny has already been determined by their own hand. The coin has 3 charges and recharges 1d4-2 charges at each long rest. If at any point the coin reaches 0 charges, it will miraculously be lost.

Ex: ""*You flip the coin for its last use, as you go to look at your hand, you only catch a gimps of it being heads before it falls off and to the ground. You look where it should have landed but it is nowhere to be seen. You feel like a cloud was lifted from your world as you begin your attack.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The Coin of the Swindler-** At any given point, this coin looks like a pile of coins equal to the value of an individuals desired quantity up to 1000 gp. Upon reaching for the pile, an individual must make an INT check of 11. If they succeed they notice discrepancies in the weight, quality, and feel of the pile and will realize the nature of the coin. Upon failure their senses are deceived and they perceive the coins as real with all of their senses. The Coin will always be transferred with the pile.

Ex: ""*You hand over a single coin and hold back a giggle as the clerk attempts to grab it with his arms. He is grinning ear to ear as he takes the coin and puts it in a large burlap sack, seeming to struggle to get all of the coins he sees into it. He hands you the scroll and takes the bag giddily to the back to start counting his gains.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The Coin of the Thief-** A solid black coin that is difficult to hold. When the coin is placed on a lock, the DM (unless he/she has the quality of the locks already in mind) will roll a D20 for the quality of the door, all number bellow 18 result in the lock becoming unlocked. The coin has 3 charges and recharges 1d4-2 charges at each long rest. If at any point the coin reaches 0 charges, it will miraculously be lost.

Ex: ""*The coin feels as though it is squirming in your hand and as you touch it to the door. You hear a click from the lock and the handle now turns freely.""*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  Due to a great idea short discussion with u/DavidsPseudonym **a** better version of the Thief's Coin is bellow:

**The Coin of the Thief-** A silver coin with heads on both sides. When the coin is held up to any thin piece of fabric/wood/metal (all up to 2 inches), the coin shows an image of whats on the other side. If used in lock-picking and trap detecting, this gives advantage (at the DM's permission). The coin only reveals what is on the other side of the material it is touching- ie if there was a lead lined door, the coin would only show through the lead.

Ex: ""*As you hold the coin up to the lock, you suddenly see all of the pins, you feel much more confident you can pick this lock now.""*",1,Made a cool set of Magic Coins. Hope yall like!
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,71,"**Overview of the Guide**

DM Development Guides are designed to enhance flavor and mechanics for a more detailed world and player engagement. The devil is in the details as the saying goes, and thus the guides will incorporate lore, background and mechanics that are easy to insert in any campaign. Each guide is designed to work together or individually to help a DM grow their world to the level of detail they wish. The guides could even work in the hands of a player who wants information to use in role play of a character that is proficient in the topic of focus. The different topics will range from wilderness biology and ecology, survival and medicine, geosciences, to urban civics and economics.

This guide is about healing and medicine. It is designed to supplement the medicine skill and the healer’s kit with actual information - arbitrary scenes with bandages and poultices can only take the story so far and just simply stating “you're healed” doesn’t have the immersive effect (or the engagement effect if a player at the table has a healing role) that it should.  

**First Aid &amp; Trauma**

*Don’t step into the wilds without some healing knowledge; you never know when your prayers might run out*.

**Lore and Background**

*Anaphylaxis*

&gt;A serious medical condition resulting from an adverse reaction to a foreign substance. In other words, an overreaction of the immune system to an allergy. The symptoms can occur suddenly and intensify quickly. Minor symptoms like itchy skin, a runny nose or a strange feeling can escalate into: trouble breathing, hives, swelling at the joints or skin, loss/reduction of voice, nausea, abdominal pain and evacuation of bowels, dizziness, loss of consciousness (from low blood pressure), cardiac arrest and death.  
&gt;  
&gt;These foreign substances may be topical, digestive, respiratory or injected. Some of these foreign substances, like venom, can be neutralized outright through an antivenom or neutralizing agent and other severe allergic reactions can be treated with by stimulating adrenaline, or introducing synthetic adrenaline in the body. The adrenaline stops the immune system from producing more allergic chemicals in reaction to the foreign agent, while increasing oxygen intake and reducing swelling at the same time. Early detection is the best response to anaphylaxis.

*Burns*

&gt;Appropriate first aid is necessary for even minor burns, while major burns require additional care and treatment. First degree burns are injuries that only affect the surface layers of the skin. While painful, these superficial burns should not pose much threat unless they go untreated and become infected (see Sepsis section below).  
&gt;  
&gt;Major burns, second and third degree, do pose serious as progressive health risks. Major burns almost always leave a scar, even if treated with care, and have a greater risk to become septic. Severe burns can leave nerves deadened and impair movement if the burn or scar tissue is located on a bone joint.  
&gt;  
&gt;Identifying second degree burns is visual; the wound will blister - this is the destroyed top layers of skin separating from the lower layers and trapping fluid. Eventually the dead skin will fall away, releasing the fluid and revealing the raw new skin underneath. It is important not to break the blisters, the raw skin underneath is highly susceptible to infection and damage. Third degree burns and greater threaten the nervous system of the individual - the loss of skin and fluid threatens the body with dehydration, hypothermia, sepsis and nerve death (loss of feeling and touch sensitivity in the affected area).  
&gt;  
&gt;Burns to the hands, feet, face or throat are also troublesome for adventurers as proficiency in common adventuring tasks might also be impeded.

*Cardiac Arrest &amp; Arrhythmia*

&gt;Cardiac arrest is absolutely a life or death situation. It is when blood flow stops because the heart has stopped beating. This is different than a blockage of an artery or a heart attack. This is an electrical malfunction in the heart where the impulse to beat is not received at all or causes arrhythmia (an irregular rhythm) that stops flow of blood to the brain, lungs and other major organs. A person suffering from cardiac arrest will lose consciousness rapidly and may stop breathing. Death will occur in minutes without resuscitation. 

*Dehydration*

&gt;When a person loses more fluids than they ingest, they risk becoming dehydrated. The body will not be able to carry out normal function without fluids. Dry mouth and tongue, sunken eyes and cheeks, extreme thirst, fatigue, dizziness, confusion are all symptoms. Dehydration can come from heat exposure, as well as many chronic kidney issues, fluid intake, shock and seizures.

*Fractures*

&gt;Breaking a bone can lead to swelling, bruising and deformity as a limb may be out of place or a bone may even puncture through the skin. A stable and closed fracture has a simple break along a clean line and does not break the skin, a compound and open fracture might have a bone piercing skin or is significantly out of place. An oblique fracture is where a bone breaks diagonally creating a sharp point and a comminuted fracture is when the bone actually shatters at the break point. The natural healing of a fracture without magical repairs is to reset the bone and stabilize as best as possible through traction and casting. Pins and rods of pure and refined metal like stainless steel or titanium may be used to support a weakened bone as it heals.

*Frostbite*

&gt;A condition where skin is exposed to extreme cold- freezing the top layer and underlying tissue. This typically occurs in the extremities first. The early stages, frostnip, is where the exposed skin turns red and tingles. Superficial frostbite is when ice crystals may begin to form in the skin, swelling and redness is apparent and the skin will feel hard or frozen to the touch. If left untreated, that is to say the affected area is not rewarmed, the frostbite will continue to progress and numbness and muscle failure can occur. Blistering is also common at extreme frostbite stages until the tissue actually turns black and dies. This type of tissue decay is typically called dry gangrene (wet gangrene comes with sepsis). The blood flow is cut off to the tissue and the area becomes dry, shrinks and turns black. At best, this will leave scarring; at worst it can lead to amputation and death. Maggots and insect spawn inside of gangrene wounds is not uncommon.

*Hypothermia / Hyperthermia*

&gt;Both of these conditions result from the loss of thermoregulation in warm blooded creatures. Those suffering from hypothermia (body temperature falls out of control) it becomes challenging to think, move or take preventative action through fatigue; which makes it particularly challenging because those afflicted with it may not have the awareness or faculties to seek aid. The person with hypothermia is at risk of laying down to sleep, letting their body temperature continue to fall until they perish. Move them to a sheltered and dry place, cover them with blankets leaving only the face clear, insulate them from the ground. Do not give this person alcohol to “put the fire back in their belly” or anything foolish like this - alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate, pulling blood from the core to the extremities and lowering core body temperature. Additionally, do not use direct heat in risk of burning the skin.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand, hyperthermia is when thermoregulation will not cool the body enough. It can result in dizziness, weakness, nausea, thirst and head and body aches and pains from dehydration. Cool off, find shade, drink fluids (not alcohol).

*Seizure*

&gt;A sudden and uncontrollable electrical nerve disruption in the brain. It can cause changes to behavior, movement, feelings and consciousness. Most seizures last half a minute to two minutes. They are common, and many happen without a clear cause, although head injury, stroke, fever, diet, sleep deprivation, disease have all been linked to seizures. A person having a seizure will commonly experience a brief period of confusion, staring, uncontrollable convulsions, irrational emotional symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the danger of a seizure is the secondary injuries that take place from the confusion or loss of consciousness. 

*Sepsis*

&gt;Sepsis is the body’s extreme reaction to infection. It can trigger a chain reaction that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death. It is caused by unclean wounds allowing germs to infect the body. High heart rate, fever or chills, confusion, shortness of breath, pain, clammy or sweaty skin are all signs of sepsis. Generally an injury with sepsis will also show wet gangrene - the tissue has dies and the injury swells and festers with open sores in the green and black wound.

*Shock*

&gt;Shock refers to either a psychological (acute stress disorder) or a physiological condition that can be life threatening. Major organs are not receiving enough blood to function during a state of shock. Shock is deadly if left untreated - the signs are rapid, weak or absent pulse, irregular heart beat, shallow and rapid breathing, lightheaded, clammy and cool skin, dilated pupils, lackluster eyes, chest pain, nausea, confusion, anxiety, thirst and loss of consciousness.   
&gt;  
&gt;Obstructive shock is a physiological form of shock where some condition has stopped blood from flowing where it needs to flow. Cardiogenic shock is loss of blood flow as a direct result of heart damage, distributive shock is when blood vessels lose tone and blood pressure drops as a result (this can be from a complication to an allergic or toxic agent, sepsis or a spinal cord injury. Hypovolemic shock happens when blood loss is so severe there isn’t enough blood left to carry oxygen to vital organs. 

*Stroke*

&gt;This is a condition where blood flow to the brain has been cut off. When brain cells are deprived of oxygen and begin to die, all the abilities controlled by that area of the brain are lost. A hemorrhagic stroke is when a blood vessel in the brain bursts or leaks, commonly resulting in death; while an ischemic stroke happens when a blood vessel carrying blood to the brain is blocked. A sudden numbness - especially on one side of the body, confusion, loss of speech, loss of vision, loss of balance and coordination and severe headaches are all symptoms of a stroke.   
&gt;  
&gt;Survivors of a stroke may experience partial or total paralysis of one side of their body, stiff muscles, complications in the shoulders, inability to flex the foot, curled toes (balance issues), visual problems, difficulty chewing and swallowing food and controlling speech, spatial attention, mixed up sensations (crossed senses), seizures, pain and other illnesses.

**Applicable Tools and Skills**

*The kit does not make the healer, so knowing what to do with that healer’s kit is what counts. Minor bandaging and rest will take care of most minor injuries. Handle minor injuries in a timely manner lest they manifest and become larger ones.*

*Antivenoms and Neutralizing Agents*

&gt;Antivenoms and antidotes are made by collecting the venom through milking or dissection and giving it in small doses to a host animal (usually a horse or a rabbit, but sheep or even dogs will work). The host animal reacts to the small dose of venom by creating antibodies, which are separated out from the blood of the host animal and purified. The result is an antivenom that acts to neutralize the toxin in the source venom.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other types of neutralizing agents generally need to be polar in potential hydrogen (pH) to the substance they are neutralizing. Acid to base and vice versa. Water is neutral pH at 7, higher pH is considered “basic” while lower pH is considered “acidic” and the further from 7 the more intense the acid or base.

*Cauterize*

&gt;Cauterization of a wound is dangerous and should only be used in extreme danger of blood loss. The practice can stop exsanguination (bleeding to death), but the resulting burn is highly susceptible to infection (sepsis) and will be very painful.   
&gt;  
&gt;To do this, a metallic instrument is heated (it needs to have a handle that won’t conduct the heat in order to be held properly) and then pressed against the bleeding wound in quick two-second bursts. Apply the burst and check technique in order to prevent nerve-killing burns. The practice is repeated until the bleeding stops and the wound is burned closed. 

*Resuscitation*

&gt;Attempting to resuscitate someone who is not breathing because of drowning or cardiac arrest is often the last option between their life and death. Note: The method below is designed for medium sized creatures of adult age. Children and people of small races require more delicate methods of resuscitation.   
&gt;  
&gt;Practice of chest compression and assisted breathing, or rescue breaths, require a firm, flat and safe environment. These methods may take a few minutes of consistent effort to have an effect and may not treat complicating injuries that led to the stoppage of breathing or heartbeat in the first place.   
&gt;  
&gt;Kneel next to the shoulders of figure as they are laid out on a flat surface. Place the heel of a hand over the ribs or cavity that contains the heart and brace the other hand on top of the first; then, using upper body weight from the shoulder joints (do not simply rely on arm strength) compress the cavity two to two and a half inches firmly to simulate a heart beat and pump blood through the body. Make compression at a rate around 100 to 120 per minute (almost 2 per second). After 30 chest compression, give a rescue breath by opening the airway and tilting the head back by the chin. Take a deep breath and press your mouth against theirs to create a seal; blow air into their lungs to simulate breathing. Thirty chest compression and two rescue breaths is one cycle. Repeat this cycle until pulse and breathing is restored. 

*Tourniquet*

&gt;This is a tight bound cloth used to stop bleeding in an appendage by cutting off blood flow to that appendage and the wound. While the practice itself is only meant as a temporary measure, it can prevent death from blood loss. Tie the tourniquet, a strong strip of cloth preferably, several inches above (closer to the torso) the wound. Use a common square knot to secure the tourniquet. Then, find a strong stick or a haft from a tool to act as a windlass- a lever to tighten the tourniquet- place this on top of the square knot and tie another one to secure it in place. Twist the windlass to cut tighten pressure of the tourniquet and cut off circulation of blood to the wound. Tourniquets left tightened for more than two hours can lead to permanent tissue damage and potentially the loss of a limb through tissue death.

*Splint*

&gt;A rigid splint can help stabilize a person with a fracture or serious sprain, allowing them to move or be moved; they additionally can help ease the pain of an injury by preventing the wounded area from moving or supporting weight (might also require a crutch or a litter). Splints can be fashioned out of something rigid and longer than the wounded area - such as a stick or a tightly rolled canvas or cloak. Other than the splint itself, the only thing required is something to fasten the splint in place - belts, shoelaces, rope or strips of cloth will work. To splint a hand, place a wad of cloth in the palm and close the fingers around the wad before fastening padding to the outside of the hand from fingertips to wrist.   
&gt;  
&gt;Attend to any bleeding before setting up and fastening a splint. Place any padding around the affected area for comfort if possible, then arrange the limb straight; moving the body part as little as possible to prevent causing more damage. The splint needs to rest firmly against the limb above and below the joint or injury. Fasten the splint tightly, but not so tightly that it acts like a tourniquet and cuts off blood flow to the limb. Once the splint is applied and fastened, check periodically that there is touch sensitivity in the limb below (away from the torso) the splint to ensure blood flow is still normal.

*Transport of the Severely Injured*

&gt;Most injuries are best treated without moving the individual, but when it becomes necessary to move to a safer environment or one that is equipped with better facilities it is important to move the person as safely as possible to not cause further injury. Small sized peoples can be hoisted like a child or in a sling by someone larger, but moving people of equal or larger size is best accomplished with specific methods.   
&gt;  
&gt;With two or more people to carry, it is best to make a litter. Take a canvas or a large cloak and spread it on the ground and find two poles or sticks strong enough to hold the weight and long enough to work with the canvas or cloak. Lay the first pole across the cloak or canvas about a foot  to one side from the middle, then fold the short end over the top of that pole. Place the second pole on top of both layers of the cloak or canvas about two feet away from the first pole and then fold both halves over the top of the second pole. Carefully get the injured person on top of the canvas between the poles and then lift.  
&gt;  
&gt;A single adventurer trying to transport another is in a tough spot. The most effective methods, depending on the type of injury will be to carry or drag them - carry with the injured person’s arms draped over the back of the support person like a pack, or carry them with their waist over the support person’s shoulder. If it is a short distance, or they are in immediate danger, then drag the injured person by the shoulders, ankles or on top of a spread out canvas or cloak to a safer location.

*Treating Severe Burns*

&gt;Simple burns can be treated with cooling salves and clean water. A few things about treating major burns: do not break the blisters or risk infection; keep severe burns wrapped in clean and soft bandages of coarse thread (no fuzz to stick in the wound). Try to cool the burn to reduce swelling, but do not add salves or use ice to do this - clean water only and preferably avoid stagnant water. Salves may be applied when the skin has cooled enough to stop bleeding (scabbing or blistering has occurred).  
&gt;  
&gt;If the burn is on the face or neck, the swelling or inflexibility in the scab as the skin heals might complicate breathing. A similar discomfort might arise from a burn that encompasses a joint. Consider making a small cut in scab to release some of the pressure and restore movement. 

**Mechanics and Progression**

*The healer’s kit in 5th edition*

&gt;Basically it says it has bandages, salves and splints. Hopefully this guide can fuel some DM and player creativity to invent other things to put here. If you want to play with an alchemy or herbalist system, I feel like that will pair really well too. I prefer [The Alchemy Almanac](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8kk4g5/the_alchemy_almanac/)by u/heavyarms_  
&gt;  
&gt;I suggest perhaps allowing a healer’s kit to treat minor injuries and wounds during short rests. Allow the player being healed to take max roll on their hit dice as a result of being treated with the kit by someone proficient. Otherwise, allow the healer’s kit to stabilize a major injury to stop it from getting progressively worse (like applying a tourniquet, administering anti-venom or by taking steps to prevent sepsis for instance) but the person still rolls for hit dice in this instance to recover health. 

*Pain*

&gt;DC = 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher. Apply this effect like concentration for spell casters or simply add disadvantage to the next action. 

*Time (short rest)*

&gt;A proficient healer with a kit can tend two minor injuries or one major injury during a short rest (this uses up all of their time during the short rest so they cannot recover hit dice unless they are applying the treatment to them self). Health recovery from rest can still be random with hit die rolls, or they can take max return if their minor wounds are healed with a kit.

*Time (long rest)*

&gt;This is when the narrative opportunities for severe injuries will surface. Allow untreated major injuries to complicate by adding conditions and allow treated ones to heal. Use the guide to describe additional effects or treatments that happen during this time. Allow for CON saves to set time (higher CON modifier gives more time before new complications emerge, lower CON modifier and complications arise more rapidly).

*Triage*

&gt;The categorizing of the sick or wounded when there is not sufficient resources to provide medical attention to everyone at once. This is used to decide who is most urgently in need of attention or transport to an environment where their healing and care can be accomplished. The urgency of care is dependent on the condition and environment of the one seeking medical attention.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is common in medical practice to color code these conditions: those who are in immediate danger of falling unconscious (almost to death saves) without immediate treatment are coded red, yellow for those who need to be monitored and certainly require care (like maybe those who need heals), and green (walking wounded who might need a short rest or first aid, but will remain stable in their current state. Someone who is at the brink of death (rolling death saves) is code blue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Color codes could be easily inserted at a table as part of combat flavor instead of the tired old “This &lt;monster&gt; looks pretty bad” description or the “I am at half health” meta mechanic. It would also give a healing class or a player who has the medicine skill something they can role play in character instead of just asking “mkay, who needs da heals?”

**Tables**

So, I'm not much for random implementation of injuries here; and this guide is really more about adding flavor to healing and giving players with the healing role something to role play with. So, a DM can use whatever injury system they want with it, but I did see an interesting post by u/keldr that gave me a minimalist idea for injuries. 

The DM can simply narrate in superficial injuries as they describe combat, and that's helpful for describing the scene anyway instead of just a damage report. But, maybe let the table come up with 6 potential injuries on a crit (applies to monsters and players alike), both major and minor (that make narrative sense to the type of damage and environment), roll the d6 and apply the injury and any detrimental effects. (This would give a player of a healing type character an opportunity to apply triage strategy). 

DM could apply a major injury (that makes narrative sense to the damage and environment) in exchange for a success if a player is rolling death saves.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,15,427,"This is an idea I had as the ""god tier"" weapon for a Paladin of Thor in my group for the 16-20 levels range, in a fairly magic heavy world. It could be pretty easily applied as a mechanic to any holy warrior who has a major goal or quest for the final stretch of a campaign.  

My Paladin had just been promoted by Thor. No longer just another follower, he was now a leader of his own Crusade. He was tasked with the duty being in charge of dealing with an emerging evil, and as the leader of this Crusade, he would need a weapon worthy of Thor himself. He was shown the most sacred chamber in the Church of Thor, a fitting room where crusaders before him took the helm of their own quests. A room filled with stacks of armor, weapons, helmets, and whatever else a warrior might need before heading into battle. it was in this room that he was shown where these weapons came from... The Forge of Thor. 

The Forge of Thor is a mechanic that allows a holy warrior to create his own weapon, fitted for whatever he deems most important for his crusade. This weapon is based off of the paladin's own journey, and the weapons he has collected along the way. By smelting magic weapons down, their magic and abilities goes into a pool of resources that the warrior can then choose from to make his own weapon.  



**Smelting down**
Any time a weapon is smelted down, the abilities of that weapon become available to forge into new weapons. 
Gain Thor points to put into weapons by smelting down magic items.

* Magic Weapon
	
+1 Thor points

* Modifiers
	
+1 Thor point per modifier (+1/+1 yields 2 points, etc.)

* Bonus Damage Die
	
+2 Thor point per damage die
The type of damage gets stored in the forge.

* Abilities
	
+2 Thor points per ability
The ability gets stored in the forge.



These points then go into a pool which can only be used once to craft a weapon. If a new weapon is needed to be crafted, new points must be accrued.
 



**Crafting Weapons**
Crusader of Thor: Can spend up to 10 Thor points on weapon. 
Any weapon crafted in Thor of Forge starts off as +1/+1 magic weapon.

* Increase Weapon Modifiers:
        
+2: 3 Points	

+3: 6 Points

* Ability Modifiers to any one stat.
	
+1: 2 Points    

+2: 4 Points

+3: 8 Points

+4: 12 Points

* Bonus Damage Die: Type of any damage you have smelted down, or Thunder. 
	
D4: 1 Point

D6: 2 Points

D8: 3 Points

D10: 4 Points

D12: 5 Points

* Abilities: Any ability you have smelted down.
	
1 Ability: 1 Point

2 Abilities: 3 Points

3 Abilities: 9 Points



The idea here is as a Paladin continues being successful on his crusade, this will be seen by a more masterful weapon. A champion of Thor may have much more than 10 points to spend on his weapon by the time he hits level 20. Let me know what you think, but so far it has been an extremely fun mechanic for our group, and has really brought in a lot of depth to the idea of a Paladin's Crusade. 

Thanks!",1,Crafting a Weapon of the God's: The Forge of Thor
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,75,"Good evening,

&amp;#x200B;

First time poster here! Running a party through a campaign. They have hit level 3 and just uncovered their first magical item! The forge cleric was talking about an ability he has to make normal weapons magical. It struck me that as a Cleric of the Forge, he should be able (with restrictions) to generate his own magical items. The characters backstory is that of a master craftsman who worked amongst those who also created magical armour and weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

We fleshed out how this would work in practice. I started compiling lists of possible items that could be created... it was slow going, until I came across a [list of magical items ranked in cost order](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showsinglepost.php?p=19457559&amp;postcount=3) (*A huge thank you to Saidoro for that).*

&amp;#x200B;

[My spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f_u5vRU8Cwpxg3Gnwwg1KBZTsA-b5ZnIKaZN4ciRhEY/edit?usp=sharing) is based on the number of people who are active participants in the ritual as well as modifiers for how well each contributes. Feel free to change those weightings!

Low dice rolls (below 8) lead to negative multipliers, where the value of the item gets reduced. Dice rolls above 12 lead to positive multipliers. The closer to 20/1 the dice rolls, the more dramatic the change in fortune.

The ritual must take place at a fully functional forge.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so here is my take on how a Cleric of the Forge can lead a ritual to create a magical item:

1. The Cleric (and any supporting characters/NPC's) can only appeal to the Deity for the level of success. There is almost no direct control over what is created. The player(s) can put in an ""**offering**"" amount initially, the rest is decided based on dice rolls and RP. The offering can include metals, scavenged weapons and gold.
2. After this point, we record **the number of active participants** in the ritual  (up to 5 on my spreadsheet). The higher the number, the greater the initial multiplier. For this value, the multiplier never goes below 1.
3. Next, the player characters each say some words of encouragement to the Cleric and/or entreat the deity for support. Depending on how well this is RP'd, I would consider advantage/disadvantage in rolls. I will record the average **persuasion** role here.
4. Now, each player takes their turn looking at the materials provided to assess for weak spots and then hammering it to make it malleable. Record **perception** rolls as well as **strength** rolls for each participant. I will give the Forge Cleric advantage on these rolls. With a number of participants, there is scope for dramatic high and low scores with commentary.
5. **Final Offerings.** The party will be invited to donate any final offerings of personal/sentimental value to influence/ boost the effectiveness of the ritual. I know that one player is planning on providing a precious stone from his homeland in the hopes that it will be incorporated into an item he can then use. The DM can roll a dice behind the screen to determine this outcome, or make a judgement call.
6. Final step. The Cleric says one final prayer to the Deity who has been invoked. Depending on the words, I may allow an advantage roll on this **religion** check.

&amp;#x200B;

After each stage, you can see what the amount in the ""pot"" looks like. The total value of the created item is at the bottom along with a suggested item which closely matches that value. Feel free to pick a different item. I've put the items I would consider to be most appropriate to the ritual in bold. I've deliberately done a range of different roll types so that I get a spread of outcomes - including weaker rolls.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,29,918,"Hey guys, I've created a one page resource, that allows you to create common NPCs (gender, race, name &amp; noticeable feature) with a single roll of 4 dice. I would love to share it with you all in the hope that it helps other fellow DMs out there. Feedback and suggestions welcome!

While hundreds of random NPC generators exist online and are able to provide you with very detailed information, I wanted something that was a pen-and-paper resource and quick to use. I've found most NPC Generator tables require several rolls of the same type of dice to slowly build the NPC up - I wanted something fast and efficient. I also wanted a pen-and-paper answer to quickly and easily come up with gender-sounding race-specific names on the fly.

So if your PCs ever ask; ""Who works in the store?"" or ""Tell me about the guards?"" (at some location you didn't plan for them to venture to). With a single roll of 4 dice per character you could easily answer;

There's a female half-orc with small teeth. Her name  is Gorustgri.

The other is a male human with a piercing on his brow. His name is Ethan.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,1,46,"So last time I wrote, it was about [the Cat's Cradle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/at2unn/adventuring_on_the_moon_the_cats_cradle/), the easiest and most safe way of getting to the Moon, which is really saying something. This post is about what your players might find on the Moon, or should've brought with them in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Here you are. You've survived your trainride up the artery of the Cat's Cradle in one piece, and your train comes out into a vast, tiled room with many vaulted doors and people in bulky suits. The train belches one last bit of exhaust as the air is siphoned out of the room (to be bottled and compressed and sold as cheap oxygen tanks) and the huge doors open, the bright light of the sun cutting through the thin glow of shielded lamps along the walls. Your carriage judders as the rail's gauge switches, and you're suddenly out, with a huge expanse of blackness above you and an endless plain of ash around you. You're finally on the Moon...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Spacesuits**: They aren't exactly dedicated for space; a lot of people just modify diving suits, or vice versa. Anything that keeps the pressure, temperature, and oxygen inside roughly survivable will work. Some brave souls rely on magic or Breaking, but that kinda shit doesn't always work on the Moon (1-in-4 chance for Visitor artifacts to fail). Most of them take up a lot of inventory space and make it tough to move deftly, and the ones that don't are delicate beyond belief.

&amp;#x200B;

*Euler Vacuum Suit*

Cost: 200 slugs, 40 minutes

Bulky, metal, stolid. Reduces your Dexterity by 3, and every hour you spend walking wastes more of your reserves (gain a point of exhaustion, if you're playing 5e.) AC like plate. Takes up 6 inventory spaces, makes you encumbered, whatever; they fucking suck to walk in, but who wants to walk on the Moon anyway? It's weird, and cold, and haunted, and there's always a wind blowing that you can feel through your suit (it's a metaphysical wind, tugging at one of your souls). Euler suits can utilize two tanks of oxygen at one time, and have slots for four more in reserve.

&amp;#x200B;

*LeBeaux Walkabout*

Cost: 250 slugs, 50 minutes

These suits are barely more than inflated, sealed leather and harnesses for your oxygen tanks, but they're very stylish and don't restrict movement. LeBeaux's is a famous department store back in the fractured land of Massachusetts, and they regularly shipped these designer suits up to the burgeoning lunar cities back in the early days of the colonization efforts, but most experienced spacers don't put much stock in their protection. No movement or Dexterity penalties, but you also can't put armor on under it. Any slashing or piercing damage you receive punctures the suit; you have 1d4 rounds before your air runs out to fix the leak or die. You also need to wear lots of layers of wool or synthetic fabric underneath, because the Moon is *cold*. Holds one tank, with one in reserve.

&amp;#x200B;

*Hargrave Spikesuit*

Cost: illegal, because whoever owns one must be a pirate

The pirate-lord Hargrave doesn't make suits, but his crews cobble them together from stolen suits. They usually scrub the blood out first, too. They weld nails and screws and razors to the outside of scavenged spacesuits, deterring predator beasts and lunar militia alike. They hug you to rupture your suits, if they can. Reduces your Dexterity by 1d3, and have similar exhaustion effects as the Euler suits. AC like studded armor, and they take up 4 inventory spaces. A critical hit against them knocks a piece off. Making a grapple or unarmed attack against someone while wearing a spikesuit does an additional 1d4 piercing damage on a success. Can hold 1d2 tanks of oxygen, with none in reserve except those you actually carry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Light sources**: The Moon is cold. It's also *dark*. Even during the day, it's a doomed adventurer who forgets about light. There's no (or at least very little) atmosphere on the Moon, and the sun shines with an intensity not known on Earth, but the Moon is riddled with rocky outcroppings and caves and forests of strange, petrified madness-trees, and you can be plunged into absolute darkness at any time. Ash-storms roil about on the surface, and the ancient halls of the dead beneath the ground have long been abandoned and rendered dark.

&amp;#x200B;

*Arc-Lamp*

Cost: 50 slugs, 10 minutes

You can clip these lights to your suit. Provide them with a charge, either thaumaturgic or via a battery, and they produce a bright blue beam that cuts through darkness like a knife for 60-70'. They get hot. It takes about 6 hours before you would even start to feel that through a suit, but if you're just holding one, it's too hot to hold after about an hour of continuous use. They need to be hooked up to your oxygen supply, but they don't consume an about to be appreciable.

&amp;#x200B;

*Moonstone*

Cost: 175 slugs, 35 minutes

Veins of luminescent silicate flow beneath the surface of the Moon like silver blood. It has a similar composition to the reified madness produced in an aurora by the polyp-trees. Most scholars agree that it is the same thing, but acted on by the miniscule pressure of the Moon over billions of years. Either way, the chunks of it glow brighter when shaken, so a lot of people put them in cages attached to their suits and power them that way. They're toxic, so don't touch them with your bare hands. If you do, roll on your favorite mutation or madness table and gain a random effect. Some people grind them up and snort them. They produce a soft white light in a 20' radius, or 40' if shaken vigorously, which then fades away after 3 rounds.

&amp;#x200B;

*Plutonium Orbiter*

Cost: 100 slugs, 20 minutes

A bit of Plutonium, struck from an elemental. It circles your head and emits an etiolated orange light in a 5' radius, leaving tracers and emitting sine-wave sparks as it does. If someone casts a mind-reading spell on you, they catch some of the Plutonium as well, and it's pissed. Looking at it too long gives you a headache. You can cast the spell *light* (even if you don't know it or have spellcasting normally) on anything made of metal, as long as you keep ahold of it. The orbiter does 1 point of radiation damage every day you have it equipped, and after every month that passes, gain a cumulative chance to mutate.

&amp;#x200B;

*Vial of Lunar Slug Oil*

Cost: 20 slugs, 4 minutes

Glass bottle with a steel stopper. A substance that isn't really oil, harvested from Lunar Slugs (creatures that aren't really slugs). It smells like lemons and graveyard wind, and glows intensely when fed meat. The oil is actually the slugs' way of reproducing, each drop containing millions of microscopic lunar slugs that are usually hibernating. When a food source is introduced, they begin feasting and fighting, causing the chemical reaction that makes them glow. After 5 feedings, the glow is dimmer as the slugs die, and after 10 one slug remains, large enough now as to fill the vial with no room to spare. When you find it, the vial has been fed 1d4+1 times already.

&amp;#x200B;

**Oxygen tanks**: This is the main thing you need to survive on the Moon. Oxygen is so important that the entire lunar economy is based on how many minutes of it you have. In Cambridge and the Harvard Lunarium are quantum-paired banks that will exchange your slugs for minutes (represented by paper scrip), usually at a rate of 5 slugs to 1 minute (although this depends on your trustworthiness as a creditor). This might get complicated when calculating XP (I use currency as XP) so I might just make it 1:1, but I want oxygen to feel even more valuable than magic or food on the Moon.

There aren't that many variants with oxygen tanks. They all contain about an hour's worth of air, and they all plug into the same adapters on your suits. However, the quality of oxygen differs, and some people pay more for air from certain parts of the world below. A shitty tank will only cost about 5 slugs, but if you get attacked and the to-hit is more than 18 the tank will leak. A good tank will set you back about 20 slugs.

Some more loose adventurers add applicators to their tank supply, vials of gas that can be added to their oxygen to give them short-lived bonuses, like nitrous in cars.

&amp;#x200B;

*Laughing Gas*

Cost: 20 slugs, 4 minutes

Anaesthetic and dissociative vapor, allows you to shrug off pain for 1d6 rounds. You can't stop laughing. When you take damage during this time, it is put off until the time that the gas wears off. You suffer no fear effects, and if an attack would kill you, you ignore it. If you recover that HP before the gas wears off, you live. Otherwise it all comes at once.

&amp;#x200B;

*Ghost Haze*

Cost: 30 slugs, 6 minutes

Distilled from the souls of the dead found clustered on the Moon. Lets you and everything you're carrying become incorporeal for 1d4 rounds. If you're phasing in something when the effects wear off, you become stuck, and take 3d10 radiation damage. Otherwise can't take or deal damage in the ghost-state.

&amp;#x200B;

*Fumes of Leto*

Cost: 60 slugs, 12 minutes

The Mad Mage Leto produced this vapor formula before he died and converted his mass into writhing bunches of worms. It allows you to see approximately 3 seconds into the future for one minute. The sensory ghosting and overloading is intense (Wisdom save or temporary insanity) but if you power through you can anticipate any incoming attacks, and your attacks do an additional 1d4 damage as you can target them more precisely.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,167,840,"I'm putting together a campaign for tier one, and I want to include two things:

* avoid an ignominious and abrupt character death for new players
* incorporate the gritty realism I like to write (it's Viking Lovecraft) into my campaigns

It has likely been considered here before, but I plan on offering a choice for those who are reduced to 0 HP: either take your chances with the Death Saves or pass all Death Saves automatically by taking on a Lingering Injury (DMG 272).  The original entry is listed below, but I have removed the *regenerate* fix as we're playing tier 1 and it's a 7th level spell.

&amp;#x200B;

**1 Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls.

**2 Lose an Arm or Hand.**  You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time.  

**3 Lose a Foot or Leg.**  Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis.  You fall prone after using the Dash action.  You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance.

**4 Limp.**  Your speed on foot is reduced by 5ft.  You must make a DEX 10 saving throw after using a Dash action.  If you fail the save, you fall prone.

**5-7 Internal Injury.**  Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a CON 15 saving throw.  On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn.

**8-10 Broken Ribs.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a CON 10 saving throw.  On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn.

**11-13 Horrible Scar.**  You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed.  You have disadvantage on Persuasion checks and advantage on Intimidation checks.

**14-16 Festering Wound.**  Your HP maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists.  If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die.

**17-20 Minor Scar.**  No further effect.

&amp;#x200B;

As an example, Conan drops to 0 HP and must decide if he wants to risk rolling death saves and death outright, or take a Lingering Injury and get back into the fight (or flee).  He goes with the Injury and rolls a 3 - off with his leg.  

For now, he's back in the fight, but bleeding out and will need his companions to haul him out of danger, so he can get some magical healing.  He'll never get his leg back, but he can fashion a prosthesis and engage with the penalties listed in the chart above. 

Thoughts and better solutions are welcome.",1,Trade a Lingering Injury result for auto pass Death Saves
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,21,90,"#Context
I am currently running my third campaign in my current world. This game include 12 players (across two groups) who are all students at Faben Academy, a school for magically gifted adventurers.

In order to give more weight to the 40+ Npcs living with them in the ""Honors"" dorm, I established a free time mechanic that represents how the PCs are spending their time outside of classes, studies, and adventures.

For context concerning balance, this system was made for a 3.5e game that has established level increases every 3 games

# Time Chart
At the start of each level a PC recieves 5 points of free time that they may spend as they wish. The actions available are designated by the chart below

Action | Cost | Effect
:--|:--:|:--
Spend Time | 1+ | Spend time with a particular NPC
Study | 2 | Boost your grade by one letter
Research | 5 | Research an additional item blueprint
Cut Class | -2 | Lose one letter of grade points to gain free time
Explore | 2 | Explore a particular area in or around the school
Work | 1+ | Gain gold equal to (character level)^2 x 10 per point spent
Investigate | 1 | Take 20 on a knowledge check pertaining to something specific.
Reflective Study | 5 | Spend your time improving yourself
Detention | 1+ | Detention can be assigned to charaters as a punishment for rule breaking
Cheat | 1 | Raise your grade by one letter
Look for Trouble | 2 | Same as explore, but in forbidden/dangerous areas
Experiment | 3 | Gain gold equivalent to 5 work actions, but with risk associated with experimentation

# Actions

**Spend Time**: Spend any amount of time with an NPC. These interactions are roleplayed out briefly in game and represent consistent company spent with the character over time. As an NPC's disposition towards characters improves, they begin to aid the party. Different Characters can offer different techniques, items, questlines, and the like to friendly PCs. Each NPC has bonuses and time thresholds at which they will distribute them. Time need not be spent by a single character.

**Study**: This is fairly self explanatory. Keep your grades from slipping too far (Expulsion due to poor performance is effectively a character death)

**Research**: This is part of a different subsystem involving item creation. This action allows the party to develop blueprints for a new magic item keyed off observable qualities in characters or found materials. The player knows the quality they are researching, but not the end result until the action is taken. Magic items must still be produced with the appropriate gold piece value after the blueprints are drafted. This was my way of sidestepping xp requirements on item creation. Blueprints may be used to create multiple instances of an item.

**Cut Class**: Inverse of the study option. This is the only reliable way to gain free time as listed on the table.

**Explore**: Spend time exploring an area of your choice for object/persons/events of interest.

**Investigate**: Sometimes a wizard simply must lock himself in a library and find out everything there is to know about the ancient mcguffin he just found. This lets you treat a knowledge roll as a 20 and helps provide information and exposition for things the party simply MUST know more about

**Reflective Study**: This action is kind of a catch-all for weird Prestige requirements and for players to gain abilities specifically pertaining to their character direction. Need to spend a week in the woods alone to become a monk of the crescent moon? Get in touch with your ancestors and learn the art of drawing power from magic nodes? Spend your free time to do so. This may only be taken with DM approval when the narrative allows it. It helps from derailing what the other players need to do without handwaving spirit journeys and the like.

**Detention**: Just like real school, teachers will penalize your leisure time for rule breaking. Detention penalties have no limit

#Risky Actions    
These Actions are either dangerous or not strictly allowed. These actions have a chance of incurring detention penalties, serious injury, or favors owed. Character decision and performance decide whether a penalty is incurred. These actions must involve some kind of skill roll(s)/combat/decision making to incur a chance of failure

**Cheat**: Quicker than studying, just don't get caught

**Look for Trouble**: Search a forbidden/dangerous area for forbidden/dangerous goodies. Don't get caught or die

**Experiment**: Mages need test subjects to advance their work. This action has characters sign up to be a magical guinea pig for a new spell/theory/item. Often incurs a short term debuff (1-2 games/days) or dangerous event

# Dark Knowledge    
Dark knowledge is something you have/know that you shouldn't. Whether its a tool once used by a well known lich or blackmail material on another student, Dark knowledge is a catch all for otherwise inaccessible leverage. Usually found as a reward for looking for trouble or finding forbidden things in the world.

Dark Knowledge counts as 5 free time points to be spent with a few stipulations.

Dark Knowledge free time must be used all at once on a single action. No dividing Dark Knowledge.    

Dark knowledge use is frowned upon. Items made with Dark Knowledge may use a clearly sinister/unstable power source. Time spent with dark knowledge is probably not a two sided exchange. Etcetera, Etcetera.    

Dark Knowledge is usually a tradeable resource. One needs not spend it on free time; it can be used as leverage in negotiations or to bypass certain obstacles.


Dark knowledge is intentionally vague and homogeneous. The goal was to give players freedom in how they wish to use it.

# Closing Remarks
This system is clearly designed to be used in a school setting, but by just removing the detention/study/cheat/cut class options, it can be used in any setting. That said, it probably functions best with regards to npc relations if used in a similar ""Home Base"" situation. However, Free time can easily be modified to include base upgrade mechanics, time spent with a faction or organization, or getting an upper hand in a war or siege.

In my experience, this dynamic use of free time has seriously engaged the players in the world and characters. The system has incentivised the players to roleplay more and interact with the world and characters. The vague nature of the incentives keeps the players curious and makes free time use more character driven than mechanically driven.

I hope this has been helpful!",1,Establishing Connections: Using free time
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,38,40,"Hi everybody, first time posting in here and I'm a pretty new DM but I wanted to see what you all thought of my mechanic for gaining weapon proficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not a big fan of the RAW options for training because my group tends to want to play faster and not sit around for long periods of downtime. So this is what I came up with.

* First the character has to be able to physically wield the weapon at all. A Halfling with an 8 for Strength wouldn't even be able to lift a Goliath's two handed Greataxe.
* If they are not familiar with the weapon or weapons similar then they are at disadvantage on all attacks for the first 2 days they use it.
* Once familiar with the weapon they can begin training and all attacks can be made but without a proficiency bonus.
* The training is 3-fold.

1.  First they have to spend a day practicing as they try to figure out the best simple ways to use the weapon. a DC 15 Int check determines if they succeed.
2. They then must take another day to practice and make another DC 15 Wis check to try and improve these techniques and perfect them.
3. Finally a third day of training accompanied by a DC 15 Dex check to instill the muscle memory needed to use the weapon effectively. 

After passing all of these in order they gain proficiency with that specific weapon type, or that specific weapon if it is a particularly fancy or unorthodox weapon. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far my players seem to have liked this mechanic and I have yet to run into any issues with it in my games. Each time it has taken at least a week in-game for a character to become proficient since the players were fairly low level and the DC is moderately high. I'd love to hear what you all think of this and if there's anything you would change or do differently. 

On a side note I wanted to say that this community is awesome and such a massive help to new DMs. I hope that I can contribute more into here as I get better at DMing and develop new things!",1,Mechanics for Weapon Proficiency
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,31,1572,"Hello,

Like many of you here, fellow Redditors, I have spent many hours of the last few months playing Red Dead Redemption 2. A video game unlike any other, with unbelievably-written characters, incredible story, rich and realistic gameplay.

However, the aspect that instantly interested me as a DM was it's world, which was the very excellence of worldbuilding. From the first minutes I realized it's potential for D&amp;D play and started thinking about how I could use it to enrich my campaign. Every new area I visited only confirmed my initial assumption - RDR2 has arguably the best wilderness in the history of video games. I'm not talking about the graphical fidelity (although it is important of course), I'm talking about how natural and immersive it is, how many interesting features it has, and how well it works within context of the game.

But the one most important thing is how well this world works **outside** the context of the game. RDR2 features a world that is incredibly easy to take out of context and present it as something completely different, even without doing many changes. Using the built-in screenshot tool, all you need to remember is to keep features of civilization, like trains and power lines, which would not fit a regular fantasy world, out of the frame.

And in that wilderness you can also find various points of interest, which are buildings, unusual objects and sites of strange happenings. Most of them are literal plot hooks that you can drop straight into the game with only a little adjustment.

When I took a screenshot of an interesting spot, I used it to give my imagination a bit of a nudge. I thought of a little story I could relate to this picture, and shaped it into a plot hook for my D&amp;D campaign. With this method I have accumulated a collection of about 130 screenshots, from snow-covered peaks to wet mershlands, each with some description, a hook, or a story. I tried my best to keep things fresh, coming up with different ideas and creatures as often as possible. I think it worked out pretty well in the end.

The gallery is a post on Imgur. Not sure if it's all right, but I could not think of a better place for a project like that, made with intention to post it on Reddit. The images are 4K, but they were captured on Xbox One S, so they might not be the sharpest. That being said, I think they fit the purpose of this project fairly well. Oh, and be aware that maybe 3 out of 129 pictures might be a little NSFW. So there's that. Enjoy.

[**THE GALLERY**](https://imgur.com/a/GyjLQ9v)

The link will work now.",1,How the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 enhances my campaign (100+ plot hooks with screenshots)
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,34,204,"In my world, the Underdark isn't a physical place, but a chaotic seperate plane connected through ancient gates in forgotten parts of the world. It's a lot of fun to play with, and I'll detail the rules at the end if you want to steal some or all of the idea. But first, why you should use it.

#The Abyss doesn't need to make sense

One of the driving forces behind this idea is I wanted a place that isn't constrained by even basic rules like locations staying in the same place, distances being consistent, and time being rigid. One of the primary reasons my players delve into the Abyss, other than for some plot hook, is because I use it as a form of fast travel - they can hop into a gate, adventure through the Abyss for a few days, and exit with only a few hours in the normal plane having gone by. Distance doesn't matter, all that matters is that they find their way through. 

But this is just the beginning. All those cool monsters in the monster manual that you'd love to take on your players, but can't really justify them being in your setting? Just have them be in the Abyss. It's a chaotic place that angels, mortals, and demons alike get lost in. You can find anything in the abyss. And due to it's corrupting nature, the beings that are usually good can be evil and insane, allowing a good party to fight stuff they normally wouldn't.  It's also a great place to introduce homebrewed creatures, because hey, it's the Abyss. You don't even need to bother with an explanation. You can introduce dungeons that wouldn't have a place in your normal plane, because it's the Abyss. 

You can also use it to test out mechanics that you normally wouldn't use in the normal plane. Because the Abyss isn't even consistent with itself, you can have a few days of mechanics like a corrupting or madness effect impact your PCs.  Or whatever you'd want to throw at your players really. Again, it doesn't need to make sense and can go away as soon as you're finished with it. 

You can use the Abyss to have NPCs keep reoccurring even when the players are constantly travelling, due to a mechanic I'll describe below. 

The best part about everything is that you really don't need to keep track of anything, unless you want to, like a town, NPC, or dungeon that the players really liked. 

###Mechanics 

This is just what I use, feel free to toss out as much as you like. I do keep a few consistent rules, because otherwise the players wouldn't really want to go in, but you can throw even these out.

Corruption - The Abyss is made up of leftover creation energy from when the physical plane was formed. It is constantly trying to undo and reform everything that exists within it - from physical structures, which may be turned into mishmashes of various terrains and structures, to living beings, which results in moments of insanity and personality change. Spending too long in the Abyss can result more permanent damage if refuge is not found. 

There are safepoints within the Abyss, called Divine Embers. These are small cracks into the Divine realm - not big enough to travel through, but it provides protection from monsters and the corrupting influence of the Abyss.  These embers vary in size - some cast light only as big as a campfire, yet others can sustain small towns.  These embers provide areas where your PCs can safely rest, though other travellers might frequent them, and they may not be accepted within communities formed around them. 

Navigation - the terrain within the Abyss often shifts and warps, so even if one travels along a path that has already been traversed, things may still seem unfamiliar. A good survival score is required to keep the party on path and on target - the worse the score, the more time it takes, the less Embers found, and the party may not even arrive at the right gate. 

Treasure - sometimes quick travel isn't enough. Incentivize your players but throwing reward for their risk.

Let me know what you think of this concept, as well as any mechanics I should toss at my players during their next journey! 
",1,The Abyss - a different take on the Underdark that you should consider using
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,38,727,"##Abstract
My player chose to take on an apprentice, so I created a small mechanic for teaching NPCs your class. In general it was a fun addition to the group. 

##Introduction: Player has an idea
So a while back ago one of my PCs congratulated me to my newest addition to the group. They were traveling in a country in which magic was universally detested when they had an encounter with a little girl talented in the arcane arts. My player took me by surprise as he started to take her in as an apprentice.

So what he told me afterwards was, although his character could not give a rat's ass about the country's population at large, he felt more engaged with the country's fate now. After doing some small training sessions with the NPC the little one grew close to him and the group gained some liking in the new member. 

##The basics
Obviously you cannot roleplay months of rigorous training. It is too boring. So I had to come up with some basic rulings for the character. Keep in mind that this is still in development.

 For each day the PC can spent one session with his apprentice.  Each session I let him role spellcraft on a DC 15. For every 2 points he gets over the DC I note down one point on the apprentice sheet. When the apprentice reaches a 25 points limit she/he achieves a magical effect like the spell he/she is practicing. This can be roleplayed out. After 100 points or 4times the smaller limit he/she will learn the first grade 0 spell. This should be roleplayed. 

The main way of steering progress is to raise or lower the limits for any given class feature. If the teaching is getting a bit boring one can lower the limit.

##Adding some spice
First of all, to flesh out the basics apprentices can have the three stages of talent which give the apprentice a bonus from +1 /+3 /+5 on the teaching throw each signifying talented/gifted/wonderchild.

Adding on the uniqueness of each apprentice I thought of some character traits. (I haven't playtested them but rather brainstormed some. I do not claim that they make sense and/or are balanced) 

No |Name | Effect
:--|:--|:--
1 |Patient learner|+2 on the teaching throw +10 on limits
2|Impatient student| 20% Chance of wildmagic effects during training - 10 on limits
3|Autodidact|creates a training point every 4 Days
4|Bookworm| Can learn from a written textbook the same DC applies as in persona learning
5|Careless|25% Chance of 1d6 damage to the student +1 point per Training
6|Stubborn | - 1 point per session
7|Natural Inclination | +2 points for one school of magic
8|Inattentive |+2 on teaching DC
9|Lively|possible to train twice, DC 20 on teaching 
10|Lazy| +1 point per training, 10 days per point when learning on his own

So the Apprentice now looks like this in my notes:

Maria, age 8, talented

Traits: Impatient, stubborn 

Points: 23 (Magehand) 

She is having reduced limits but wildmagic effects, is sometimes a bit difficult to work with and after some amazing teaching throws is a quarter on the way to learn Magehand. 

##Concluding remarks
So the wizard in my group had a talk with me the other day. We try to keep tbe apprentices business mostly off the table. I think one roll every long rest when his student is arround is not going to effect the flow of the game too much. The wild magic can lead to some funny interactions though. Furthermore, I think that I can do some neat plot hooks with her in future. In general I have the feeling that she is the most memorable NPC my group is traveling with.

When she is done learning enough spells for a level one wizard I think she is going away from the group on a kind of training voyage. If the wizard gets bored he can also dump his apprentice at the next academy, though. 

I think this system can be also adapted for other types of aprentices like squires or acolytes, which is why I put it up here. As this is a work in progress I appreciate any criticism and as always feel free to steal and adapt. 

Note: I tried to scale down the DC to 5E numbers. I am playing 3.5 so it is (roll-15) /5 in my game. 

Edit 1: If that looks familiar to you, it is inspired by how ""the dark eye"" handles crafting. I realized this just now.

Edit2: As another way of slowing down the learning process you could leave greater gaps between the checks as gnarlymuppet suggested in the comments ",1,Apprentices: A way to engage PCs in your world

",1,100 Studio Ghibli Plot Hooks :)
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,63,"So I wanted to make some changes to Lif, the poltergeist""from Waterdeep Dragon Heist and add another side to the story and that lead me to think about how Incorporeal Entities (shadows, specters, poltergeist, will-o-wisps,banshees, and wraiths) are handled in 5e.

A while ago I came across a blog post that detailed how to run an exorcism and it made me really want to run my players through it but I thought ""what is the point if they can just kill the creature?"" and I never used it.

Fast forward to recently. Wanted to make a change in WD:DH and it led to making some  changes overall:

&amp;#x200B;

Incorporeal Entities: ***any creature that gets incorporeal movement qualifies as an incorporeal creature***

* Shadow - CR 1/2
* Specter/Poltergeist - CR 1
* Will-o-Wisp - CR 2
* Ghost - CR 4
* Banshee - CR 4
* Wraith - CR 5

Ways to Kill Incorporeal Entities:

* Exorcism
* Destroying what the entity is tied to (an item, a location, a person etc)
* Ghost Touched Weapons
* Completing unfinished business

\* *Ghost Touched Weapons  are weapons that have been created specifically to deal with incorporeal beings. In my setting are created by binding some type of incorporeal entity to a weapon through magical runes carved into the item. Can be done with bows, quarterstaffs and other weapons.*

Outside of those methods when incorporeal creatures are ""killed"" they actually just dissipate to wherever you decide they go for x amount a time:

If the entity wasn't killed in a violent manner then when they are ""killed"" outside of those methods they dissipate for **1d10 -CR months**. If the entity was killed in a violent manner then whey they dissipate for **1d10-CR days**. Where they dissipate to is up to you. I'm partial to either the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Sea, or whatever plane their souls would reside if they had already moved on.

Now per the description of some of these monsters not all the methods will work for them. For example Specters (and technically poltergeist since they are a variant) can't have unfinished business completed. Here's the excerpt from the MM

***Beyond Redemption.*** When a ghost's unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.

I also think that a Banshee wouldn't be eligible for the unfinished business part but obviously you can do what you want.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example Encounter:**

Your players are at an inn drinking and talking and just enjoying the atmosphere when they hear a loud crash against the tavern door as if someone had thrown a body into. Another crash and the door rushes open and in tumbles the fifth son of the mayor of the town. He's foaming at the mouth, his eyes are bulging and rolled back and he is clawing at his already clawed and bloody face.

Any attempts by commoners to restrain him leads them to be thrown off quickly as if he has some sort of inhuman strength. If any of the players try to restrain him it's a DC 13 or anyone with a passive athletics of 13+ or 16+ Strength automatically succeeds. If he is restrained he'll thrash around for a little bit before the ghost emerges from his chest and flies away through the wall. If he is not restrained he'll run head first into a wall and break his own neck and then the ghost will emerge and fly away.

This is the ghost of the mayor's mistress, a young half-elf woman named Janaris. She was the daughter of the local seamstress. The mayor murdered her after finding out she was pregnant and was going to keep the child and made it look like a suicide. If nothing is done Janaris will murder all the mayor's sons and then kill him. 

Options for the players

**Exorcism:** the players can go speak to a local priest and ask them to help pinpoint where this ghost might be tied to in order to perform an exorcism. If there is a cleric or god-worshiping paladin in party they could perform the exorcism themselves.

**Destroying its ties:** Janaris is technically tied to her room where she was killed and her body was discovered. If it is destroyed Janaris will be destroyed as well. She lived with her mother, Sylleth (an elven woman) above the shop where they both worked. It is possible to just destroy the room but if the players aren't careful they could burn down the entire shop.

**Ghost Touched Weapon:** If the players have access to this type of weapon (its a small town they would have to travel to a nearby city to purchase one or pilfer the tomb of a local hero) they can fight her head on but the killing blow has to be from the Ghost Touched Weapon.

**Completing Unfinished Business:** If the players either a) bring the mayor to justice or b) kill the mayor Janaris will stop trying to kill all the sons and will finally rest in peace.

If the players simply try to kill Janaris with mundane weapons she will dissipate but she will return in 6 (1d10-4) days since she died violently. If the players aren't there when that happens she will kill all the sons and the mayor and the players may or may not eventually hear about it.

**My Unrefined Notes on Exorcisms:**

It would be run like a skill challenge and the ratio of fails to successes would grow with the strength of the entity. 

Priests, Acolytes, Clerics and god worshiping Paladins can all attempt an exorcism in their gods name. (I would probably maybe also include Celestial Warlocks or the Favored Soul Sorcerer) just anyone that has some relationship to a divine being (good or evil) The status of the relationship between the exorcist and the divine being would affect how effective the exorcist is. 

I like the idea of specific exorcisms for specific entities. Like a ghost needs to be bound in a circle  with x objects that belonged to them in real life or the chance of the exorcism not working increases.  
Maybe you need to have bottled divine light to deal with a shadow.

I would add penalties for exorcism. In the real world exorcisms are taxing and can last for days. So for every failure the exorcist would suffer a point of exhaustion + one additional one for the overall exorcism. 

Oh also a failed exorcism might push the entity to transform into something nastier/stronger than what it already is. 

And for players that are around but not participating in the actual exorcism I would have the entity have some sort of lair action where strange shit happens. So if someone was exorcising a shade on one of the initiative count 20 the players shadows might start to try and kill them etc.

Exorcist could also gain some sort of advantage based on spells they used. So if a cleric decided to somehow incorporate ceremony into the exorcism it would convey some sort of tactical advantage.

&amp;#x200B;",1,Changing How We Deal With Incorporeal Entities
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,27,188,"First off, thanks to my good friends @seerofbirds on twitter and [u/DeathMcGunz](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeathMcGunz) for all the help and inspiration on this.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell you all about the Moon. I’ve told you about the Moon before, but I thought of more stuff and wanted to polish this up a bit, fix any discrepancies except the ones I liked.

Back in the old days, before Harvard sold their campus to the rail barrons and emigrated to the pitted and silent surface of that cold celestial body, humanity fired great guns and shot bullets filled with science equipment and researchers into its face. Most of the intrepid voyagers died on the way, and as everyone knows, when you die in space your soul is tethered where it happens.

The Moon is filled with ghosts and sad spirits.

This is the first post about a custom setting I'm building, a very weird version of the 1890s, in which some aliens visited Earth and severely fucked up all of reality. The Moon provided an escape for the harried Earthlings, and so the brilliant minds of what was once Harvard University began trying to find a way up into its silent expanse of silicon forests and dried, ashen seas. After the first round of man-cannons and primitive rocket ships and fucked-up teleportation spells, they stumbled on a mix of alien alloy and electricity, manmade and grown in equal measure. Some say they performed a dread ritual of some sort, and indeed the result seems to have its own strange intelligence, as if it were alive; miles-long hollow tubes, like alveoli or muscle fiber, stretching up and pinioning the Moon in place, providing air and shelter from the emptiness of orbit.

# The Cat's Cradle

is what this shifting mass of living metal is called. It looks like a column of twisted wires up close, and a shining filament from far away. At its base, where it burrows and clings into the bones of the earth, spreads a dark stain of railways and train berths and stations, spilling oil and fire into the sky. This is where the campus of Harvard University was, before the Formless Ones reassembled it exactly on the banks of the Mare Tranquillitatis. Cambridge now supplies the bodies needed to keep such a beast satiated and running. The railyards are operated by infinitesimal railway companies, blooming and dying like sped-up footage of slime-molds, like animals fighting and killing. Everyone gets mutated and goes insane here. After the brainiacs killed themselves trying to shoot the Moon, they decided to try the most modern and reliable form of transportation instead; the locomotive.

They built engines of shards and discarded Visitor tech, engines that ran on probability and chewed through miles like the seven-league boots of myth instead of puny mortal engines of coal and fire. The engine cars have tendrils of metal that act like feelers and will cut you to the bone before you notice they're even there. Don't stand too close to them. Thanks to these miraculous devices, you can get to the Moon in a matter of hours.

(The engines don't work correctly in atmosphere, for some reason. Some combination of the alloy of the Cradle and the weird forces of orbit make them able to disregard traditional space.)

The tunnels (if that is the right word; the only thing they tunnel through is *upward,* through emptiness) meet the ground, and in the openings the train tracks lead in great circles and switches and engineered junctions. Gravity is strange in the tubes. It circles and twists without you knowing until you’re riding perpendicular to the Earth you’ve been confined to by the demon Inertia. The tracks are maintained by spacesuited-men riding handcarts.

Here are some of the train companies you might interact with, and the kinds of trains they are known for building:

 

**1.** **The Wail Railway Company**. Formerly owned by railway magnate Orion Wail. He was converted into sentient vibrations and has since retired to a castle made of noise suspended above the New York Island. His board of directors have continued in his stead, provided a reliable and fairly cheap means of transportation. Wail engines scream through the normally-silent halls of the Cradle, announcing their presence on both the physical and metaphysical planes to ward off danger and call to other conductors. Passengers are offered earplugs on departure. 300 shards per ticket, and 1d4 day to get to the Moon.  


**2.** **The Steinbeck &amp; Lowe Corporation**. Known for the use of golems instead of mechanical parts. Made of clay comprised mainly of lunar ash. Like big urns with wheels, pulling themselves along the tracks with arachnoid arms. They don't market as a travelling service (their primary export are their exquisitely lifelike golems, which can only be made on the Moon under very specific conditions) but will provide you with transport if sufficiently bribed. 100 shards, 2d4 days to get there, but no one wants to rob a golem-train. They're spooky when they fight back.  
 

**3.** **Ohm &amp; Milosh Iron**. The Messrs. Ohm and Milosh wish to provide the most comfortable and expedient journey to the most discerning of customers. For enough money you can ride to the Moon in complete style and comfort. The *Reduvius* engine makes use of a paired probability-drive and analytical device imprinted with the post-mortem consciousness of an *Arilus cristatus gigantis*, creating a systemic whole. The engines are bred from Messr. Ohm's personal stock of giant wheelbugs, threaded and trained before death to traverse the Cradle. These trains are subservient to each of the Milosh fragments that operates them, and are vaguely predatory. The wine is to die for. 2,500 shards for a 1d8 hour trip.  


**4.** **The Scrapyard Boys**. Not a real company, more like a gang, but there's enough of them that it doesn't matter. Ran by a dead woman named Cutter. They steal the gutted hulks of old trains and cobble together shit from terrestrial technology. Everything is dirty and rusted and barely-held together, but it runs. All the trains have scavenged engines, so the journey is about twice as long as any other group, but they're the cheapest out there. Just don't be surprised if you get pressganged into being a pirate on the way. 20-50 shards (they haggle), and it takes 2d20 days to get there.  


**5.** **The Deathly Choir**. A company of the clergy, split from the New Catholic Church in the days since the First Visitation. They monetized worship across the land, turning faith into dollars to God Mammon. They saw the potential shards to be made in helping sinners prevent eternal damnation: as I said before, if you die in space you stay there. They drive tomb-trains full of dying sinners, both real and those who worried they wouldn't make the cut to get to Heaven. They only take you if you go to Confession and can provide proof that you're dying. They don't *technically* charge anything, they just seriously recommend donating for the railtithe. The Deacon stationed in Cambridge is a sallow man called Johns who seems to be splitting into several possible Deacons. The journey is fairly long (2d8 days (you're supposed to die on the way, after all)), and the appointments are as cramped and bare as coffins, which they are.  


In addition to passenger trains, the halls of the Cat's Cradle are crawling with merchant trains carrying compressed oxygen, food, water, plants, books, and cigarillos to the Moon while others haul the spent containers and magical exports and research papers and college kids on sabbatical back to Earth. You can breathe and walk in the Cradle, but that’s inadvisable. Getting lost is incredibly easy; it takes teams of dedicated cartographers to map the ever-changing routes of the Cradle. One tiny slice in the wall and the cold rushes in and the air rushes out, boiling with radiation and suffocating you. Strange ecologies form in the tunnels, fed by the runoff of the madness rain on the Moon like silver blood, flowing along the ties of the tracks. Lattices of souls, living trains, tardigrades grown swollen from food and insanity. You can hear the mercury-rain pattering against the walls as it falls in aurora-sheets off the surface of the satellite. And many take to piracy, both en route and actually on the Moon, to subsist. They drive stolen and modified trains daubed in blood-red and jaundice-yellow paint in the forgotten or fractal spaces of the Cradle. They kill and pillage, and the rail companies regularly send militias and armored engines into the recesses. Your players might negotiate their way to the Moon in exchange for killing some pirates and rendering a portion of the Cradle safe for travel once more.

Many companies in Cambridge sell lunar supplies, like spacesuits and arc lamps and bottled oxygen. It is a dead adventurer who doesn't come prepared to the Moon. There are also oxygen banks, which will exchange your shards for minutes of oxygen. Shards and dollars are useless on the Moon; minutes of air is your currency.

# Legion Trains

Sometimes, things go wrong. Air leaks from the tube, and the train is suspended in vacuum. The seals fail, and everyone on board dies. Usually, the train stops. Or, the engine churns its way through the seething metaphysical mass of souls deposited in from of it with no problem (which is one of the only ways to actually be put to rest in space-to have your soul entirely consumed). But sometimes, the engine can’t chew all the souls at once. They bunch together, blending, turning, like hair in a drain, and the train can’t fight its way through it. Something changes in the gears and flywheels. The train suddenly *is*. It thinks. It has a head full of fragmented memories and personalities, and it knows that it is alive. And it wants to stay that way.

These rogue locomotives are called legion-trains.

Usually the rail company hunts them down (involving a great chase and lots of harpoons.

# The Umbilical Theory

No one is quite sure what the Moon is. Some think it is a captured planetoid that was drawn in by Earth’s gravity, some think it is the egg of a strange god and that it must be nurtured to hatching, some think that it is a failed version of Earth that shriveled up in death. But some believe that it was once a part of the Earth itself, excised like a malignant tumor. The dead surface of the Moon belies the life under the crust: vast networks of fungus and bacteria, burrowing insects comprised of silicon and glass, metaphysical beings grafted to ancient ruins. The connecting of the Earth to the Moon has brought about a renaissance for the flora and fauna of the Moon. Things are stirring that have never seen the etiolated light of the sun before. A division of the Lunar College of Harvard have devoted their time to studying this effect via the Cat’s Cradle, the ripples of change that are sweeping the dark rock. A few extremists think the Cradle should be destroyed, but business is far too important to lose to a few nutjobs.   
 

Anyway, I'll be posting more about this setting as I write it up! Next up will be the Moon proper, some stats for lunar monsters, maybe a collection of equipment, writeups for the Harvard Lunarium and the Regents and the Formless Ones.",1,Adventuring on the Moon - the Cat's Cradle

It's a tool that randomly generates a number of books for you, the books are taken from json files which contain books from different works of fiction (Elder Scrolls, Doctor Who, Harry Potter, Lovecraft, Marvel, MTG, SCP, Tolkien).  


The dataset for the tool is still a WIP, with many books missing from each of the sources currently in the tool, and with many details like author , genre and description missing as well.  


I was wondering if anyone would be willing to help me with this tool, by adding more books to the existing sources, and adding new sources of books.  


I got the idea for this tool after reading [u/thebrokenhaiku](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebrokenhaiku)'s post with it's list of cards from MTG, and thought to myself that it would be great to have all of these books in one place, and be able to randomly generate them.  


To use the tool just run the typescript file (either by compiling it with tsc and running it with node, or by running it with ts-node) with the parameter random and how many books you want. Like this ""ts-node books.ts random 10"".  


There are currently 728 books in the dataset, authough i suspect some of the books from the different Elder Scrolls games are duplicated with slightly different spelling of their names (v1 vs Vol I for example)",1,"Book Keeper, a random library generator for D&amp;D and other roleplaying games"

You don't have to have custom deities to fill the ranks (Mine doesn't! I use most of the Dawn War pantheon). But this will be a project to build a custom framework for fitting in whatever specific gods you want! Those can be ones you've made up or ones like Bahamut and Tiamat. 

This round, we’re going to start taking a look at what the way mortals and their faith interact with divinity. For your world's pantheon, consider the following questions. 
___
1.  In real life, religion and faith has a ""belief"" aspect to it that is intrinsic to a person's faith. In D&amp;D, gods are generally assumed to exist in some form or fashion. Given that, are there atheists or agnostics in your world? How do they handle the existence of divinity? If your deities' existences are widely acknowledged, how do people with little to no faith recognize them? 
2. In general, how do the faithful people view the pantheon overall? How do they generally view their favorite deity? 
3. Is there space for polytheistic worshipers? If so, are the gods jealous about split worship? If the gods require monotheism, what happens if someone has a change of faith? Is there a different kind of effect if a PC with class levels in cleric/paladin or something that has a patron deity associated?

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,72,571,"Hi, I'm TuesdayTastic and today I am going to walk you through how to design a dungeon as if it were a Hitman level. For those of you who don't know, Hitman is a video game where the assassin Agent 47 must explore a location, learn the habits of his targets, and execute them all while remaining undercover. Recently, Game Makers Toolkit just released a video titled ""The Making of Hitman's 2 Miami Level"" in which he talks with the developers and asks them how they designed this level for their game. What I learned from watching this video was that the game design principles they apply to their version of Miami are also something that can be applied to Dungeons and Dragons. 

*Disclaimer: I have not played a Hitman game, but after watching the GMTK video about it I was inspired to write this. If you have any insights to share about Hitman's level design in relation to Dnd please let me know in the comments below!*



#Give the NPC's a Schedule

One of the many ways the Hitman series make their worlds feel more alive is by giving all of the characters in the game a schedule that they follow. The target that you are intended to assassinate will follow a simple schedule where they will look out a window for a while, explore their office building, talk to some scientists, and maybe put some eye drops in the bathroom. Giving NPC's a predictable schedule achieves 2 important goals which I will get into below. 

The first goal that this achieves is it makes the world feel more alive. By giving the NPC's schedules that are independent of the players, it helps to give off the feeling that the world wasn't created for the players but is instead it's own living and breathing entity. Then when the players disrupt the schedule it lets the players know that their actions do have an impact on the world. This creates this wonderful feeling where the world is both independent and dependent on the players and gives them empowerment without having to spoonfeed it to them.



The other reason to give NPC's schedules is to make them predictable enough that the players can formulate plans around these schedules. If they know that their target is going to go to the bank once a week on Tuesday at 3:30 PM they can create plans based off of this. Without this schedule in place, it is much more difficult for the players to plan, and instead of going for a much more elegant solution that they all agree is fun, they may have to try and murder their target as soon as they see him due to not knowing where he might go. If you want to learn more about creating NPC schedules /u/FamousHippopotamus post about [NPC Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ap0oz3/npc_life/) is a good place to start. 

#Make NPC Conversations Relevant

Hitman is interesting in how it strives so hard for the game to feel realistic but has a very gamey element in the fact that whenever you are in earshot of NPC's having a conversation, the conversation will almost always be relevant to what you are doing. For example, if you overhear an engineer they will mention how the stage could potentially blow up, which is intended to give the players the idea of using that for a future assassination.

People in real life don't always say the exact thing you need to hear right as you get into earshot of them. But Hitman chooses to do this anyway because it allows the developers of the game to communicate ideas to the players in a much more natural way than something like a popup that directly tells the players what to do. It allows the player to feel intelligent and that they came up with the idea to rig the stage to explode when really it was the developer's intention all along. 



Taking this concept to Dnd is as simple as making sure that the details you give the players are relevant. When you sit down to play a session of Dnd there is only so much time for you guys to play. By keeping the details relevant to what the players are doing, you can speed up the game, and still keep it interesting and engaging. Give the players details that they can act upon, rather than details that are pointless. 

#Snail House and Swiss Cheese

Another concept that the video talked about was the Snail House and Swiss Cheese method of level design. The basic idea is that you design your level like you would design Ikea. The goal of this kind of level design is that there is a scripted path throughout the entire level that will slowly snake its way through everything that you want your audience to see. The Swiss Cheese portion of this design comes through when you introduce shortcuts, that allow experienced people to go exactly where they want to go, without having to follow the main path. [Mark Brown talks more about the Snail House Swiss Cheese design in his video at 11:20.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56iiP2xQn74#t=11m20s)



Applying this to dungeons is something that can help the players feel like they have gained mastery over a certain level. When the players first travel through the dungeon, they may encounter everything in its predetermined order without going off track. However, when they have to backtrack through the area, they might remember a shortcut that will save them precious time and make them feel like they have mastered the encounter. 

Another technique that can be derived from this design method is to never have a dead end. The developers of Hitman do their best to make every location have at least 2 exits. Every exit is also an entrance, which gives the players the freedom to explore however they choose. With no dead ends, they will choose to keep on walking forwards and discovering new things. This only gives the players more options and helps to create that swiss cheese effect that can create unique and memorable dungeons.

#Conclusion

Hitman does an excellent job of designing its locations both for the players and for the world itself. Everything has a place and a purpose, and the developers make sure that the world does it's own thing, while also giving the player enough stability that they can execute their own plans. They also make sure that the details that the player discovers are relevant to what they are doing, keeping them on task, and even communicate ideas in a natural and organic way. Finally, through the use of the Snail House, they can design levels that allow the player to see everything, and then use the Swiss Cheese method to make the player feel like they have mastered the level. All of these concepts can be applied to Dnd and provide a lot for our games. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,30,185,"TLDR:  Let some special monsters give exhaustion levels instead of damage, or steal death saves as a way to keep high level PC's on their toes in combat.

&amp;#x200B;

Something I see come up with some regularity on various fora, including this one, is how to keep combat challenging/deadly for higher level characters without cheesing things like turning everything into an HP-sponge.  While the suggestion outlined here is certainly not for frequent use, I think it can help spice things up from time to time and I would love feedback.

The essential idea is to create a monster that has relatively low HP, middling AC, a decent to-hit bonus, and does no damage on a hit.  Instead, a struck PC takes a level of exhaustion.  Use in small groups to terrorize players.

The mechanics are fairly simple, but I think it works because it subverts all of the players' expectations.  Suddenly, the beefy bear-totem barbarian is just as squishy as the bookworm wizard; they can each take 5 hits before the next one kills them.  All the healing abilities they have are meaningless because they're still at full HP.  They'll need to burn a 5th level Greater Restoration *per level of exhaustion* to get back to normal fighting shape.  In short, all the tactics they normally rely on to steamroll through normal encounters go out the window.

Again, this is not something to do often.  Part of the allure is the horror for the players as they realize what is happening.  There should also be a thematic component to the monster that makes the mechanic make sense, such as a special wraith or something like that, i.e. something that can be described as ripping apart their souls instead of their bodies.  If done properly, though, players should find themselves rediscovering the dread they had as level 1s when they hadn't become a well-oiled machine with super powers.

An alternative/supplemental mechanic would be to have a monster that does normal damage but also forces a Con save on a hit, with a failure resulting in the PC losing a death save.  Nothing happens to them until they hit 0 HP and they are down however many death saves; if they lost three death saves before dropping then they die.  I have already house ruled that failed death saves stay until a long rest, so the two would combine for some harrowing moments.

To my mind, neither mechanic should be used if it is likely to outright kill a PC barring bad luck or extremely poor decision making on their part.  It is not a mechanic intended to cause death, but instead to cause fear; to reintroduce the unknown so the players themselves are unsure whether this crazy monster is going to be normal or super deadly.

Another use of these mechanics is to slow down the pace of the adventure.  If you need the PCs to stop for a week somewhere for whatever reason, pushing multiple levels of exhaustion on them through a combat encounter like this may force them to since they will probably need to rest for several days to rid all the PCs of the exhaustion levels.  Use it to get them to stop and then provide a hook to keep them there so your BBEG can do whatever they are doing that is going to take a couple days.

Again, I would love feedback on the mechanics from anyone, especially those who have tried something similar.",1,Spice up combat by subverting player expectations
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,97,374,"Yo yo yo!

&amp;#x200B;

I've had an interesting idea recently that, once I thought it through, became this - threatening strikes. It is a simple mechanic that could add some extra spice to your combat and make it feel more dangerous, forcing your players to decide if they want to risk it or play it safe. It was inspired by many monsters having multiple different attacks in their stat block.

&amp;#x200B;

*A creature can prepare a threatening strike at the end of its turn. It picks one PC and prepares one of its attacks or moves. On its next turn, if that creature can attack that PC with prepared attack first thing on its turn, that attack deals full damage if it hits.*

&amp;#x200B;

So if creature has to move or use bonus action/reaction on its turn before delivering the threatening attack, it fails. Regardless whether threatening attack still threatens, creature is NOT locked into performing it. It can freely choose to forgo it for a more advantageous attack or move. Preparing it does not cost anything but if threatening attack is a spell, you may rule it requiring concentration like when readying a spell.

&amp;#x200B;

Point of this is to make combat for players more reactive and dangerous. It is a move that can put a PC on the spot, requiring them to choose a way to defend themselves or hinder their foe before they deliver the attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you an example. Let's say we have some bandits attack the party. One of them has a sword. He moves in melee between barbarian and rogue. He attacks barbarian with his sword and at the end of the turn threatens rogue with his sword. You would say something like: *""Stabby, that sword-wielding bandit turns to face you. He restores his stance and prepares his blade, its tip pointing towards you!"".*

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of his next turn, if that rogue is still in melee range of bandit's sword, that attack deals maximum damage to rogue if it hits. If rogue moves away, forcing bandit to move, his sword attack is no longer threatening for rogue.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example. Bandit's brother has a shortbow. Seeing as rogue managed to avoid the sword brother, he releases an arrow at rogue and at the end of his turn threatens rogue with his shortbow. You may say something like: *""You see bandit with the shortbow kissing an arrow, nocking it and focusing his aim at you!""*

&amp;#x200B;

This time though, it becomes more difficult to get out of the weapon's range. Rogue would have to think of other options such as Dodge, taking cover (ideally total cover) or moving into melee to give bandit disadvantage to that attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Few initial thoughts about this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. This is imagined as an option only available to DM, not players.
2. Attack must be specified in a somewhat clear manner and targeted PC must know they are targeted.
3. This works with any attacks, even spells, but not all attacks and spells in a single turn (if you choose claws, bite attack is NOT threatening even if it is melee attack).
4. If you make longsword attacks threatening, all longsword attacks deal full damage if creature has multi-attack.
5. I think it should work with attacks of opportunity for melee attacks???
6. If attack or spell deals AoE damage, only chosen target takes full damage (half of full damage on save).
7. Not every creature should do this every turn. It would likely slow combat down and force PC to defend all the time. Maybe give it to a big brute guy or limit it to one threatening strike per round between all enemies?
8. If enemy crits threatening attack your PC is f\*\*\*\*\*.
9. I did not test this in game yet.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems super cool to me, would love to hear how you guys can improve it and sorry not sorry for a wall of text :P

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE2 : After consulting some comments few things are becoming possible way forward.

&amp;#x200B;

1. This should be used sparingly, I would assess at most once per round. Same creature shouldn't do it twice in a row if it isn't alone. This is a tool to raise stakes in a fight, not to pummel party in an already intense fight.
2. It should NOT work with AoO.
3. This is a tool to make combat more dynamic. Use it to target players who are ""safe"", to put spotlight on various party members. Don't just spam it on a fighter already in melee, but also don't ignore him.
4. I feel like melee PCs using Disengage isn't unfair - it is always available safest option. Cost is your action, but you are probably guaranteed to succeed while not taxing rest of your party. Targeted PC must react, but Disangage isn't the only option, it is the safest option. For this reason I feel like taking AoO from a threatening foe makes it too easy for melees, now they can just attack and step away - hardly a choice had to be made.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,11,46,"[Archways and Archway Coins](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LYx29X_aNv03qqZUwKk) is a system that my group has come up with to incorporate one-shots in a narratively satisfying way in addition to bringing back the magical item creation they crave from earlier editions (notably 3.5e). By adding it to DnDBehindTheScreen, I hope to give back to a community that has inspired me time and again.

Many of my players come from older editions of D&amp;D (3.5 mostly, as evidenced by most of the enchantments just being direct ports from there) and grew up building their own magical items. Since we started playing 5e after the playtest, we've tended to ignore the 'optional' tag on magical items in favour of finding our own balance using higher CR encounters to allow for magical items to flow more freely. While gold is nice enough a system to pay wizards to create magical items, and we do have prices for most of the effects presented here in gold, Archway Coins were an attractive alternative. Coins allow me to hand out 'magical items' in a very controlled way, in a system removed from the buying power of favours, land, castles and keeps, airships and the like. This separation is something I've really enjoyed having the control to do as the DM. Not having to choose between building a stronghold and being able to make progress on *Broken Promise* the *+2 vicious longsword* has been great for my players as well.

The best way to use the Archway and Archway Coin systems is to take them and modify them to fit your game. Not every world is going to have Archways scattered across the terrain, waiting for adventurers to come across them and attempt their challenges! And even those that do are not going to provide these challenges without risk of death or other permanent effects. Worlds with raw power of Creation floating around are not always going to have this power coalesce into coins capable of allowing anybody to create all possible magical items. Perhaps these coins can fuel spells cast by ancient wizards, allowing only a select few to create these items? Perhaps the possible enchantment effect list is much more restricted, or wildly more free form? 

I have endless ideas of enchantment effects, archway ideas, and more, and will try to keep this linked version updated as I move ideas from my personal 'rough' version to a more final, hopefully balanced version presented here. If anything at all, I hope these systems just inspire you to add something to your worlds.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,78,1166,"DMing can be exhaustive vocally and lyrically. Here are some tips/tricks/tools that you can use to make the most of your words, both when talking actively at the table, and when writing notes/adventures for others (or yourself) to read. 

**SHOW DON'T TELL**
---

You hear this a lot as a film and literature student. It's the biggest non-advice people want to give you. But it's only non-advice because instead of educating you on their uses, people tend to take a side and say one is bad and the other is good. It's important for an artist to make opinions on tools that they find useful, but it's counterproductive to try to teach in that regard. The English language has many tools for a writer or orator (both of which DMs are) to use to create their art. 

Let's not take sides now. Let's learn and practice and share knowledge. This short article is set up as four tools, with an example, and a short description of what it does, or what it tries to do. 

TELL
--

""*It was winter.*""



What’s it do? The onus is now on you to fill in the scene with *your* winter. Was it cold? Windy? Snow or rain? Are you comfy or out of place? Your brain creates the scene. It’s personal to you and has nothing to do with an image of winter the artist is trying to give you. 



""*Tim is sad.*"" 

""*Eric went to the store.*""

""*It’s so cold out.*"" 



Most things we say are “telling”. Not because we are audibly communicating, but because we’re telling someone something instead of an alternative; leading them to a conclusion, painting a picture for them, making a comparison. 



SHOW
---

Here are three big ways you can show instead of tell. Simile, Personification, and description. 



**Simile** 

""*That winter was like a grave.*"" 



What’s it do? It creates emotion. Feeling. Vibe. Atmosphere. Again the onus is on you to fill in the look and the details. What is a grave like to you? What does that evoke? If it’s a solid simile it will create a universal image or draw upon tropes that everyone understand. 



**Personification**

""*Winter gripped my chest with its icy claws.*""



What’s it do? More of the above. Emotion. Feeling. It turns the inanimate into living creatures and monsters. It begs you to relate to it, like you would another living creature. Even if that relation is horror, or fear, instead of love or kindness. The relation it creates is entirely based on the relationship between the *thing* and what it is personified as. 



**Description**

""*The snow was shin deep and the pavement dried white. Black trunks of trees held bare branches. No birds were tangled in their limbs.*"" 



What’s it do? It’s part mystery, part riddle, part painting. Nowhere do I *tell* you it’s winter. I show you *my* winter. The purpose is for the artist to give you their image. The onus is on them to give you what is in their head and for you to see it and experience life in someone else’s mind. The fun for the reader/listener is the discovery of parsing the information together to create a unified image.

To end this article, I have a little tag line that I use to close out my pieces. ""Good luck, don't die."" But instead I want to ask a question. What's another piece of writing advice or wisdom that you've heard that doesn't make sense or seems contrived?",1,show don't tell. dm tools.
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,41,"  

Sorry if this seems like a bit of a slog, I'm very new to reddit. But without further ado, let's get into this different approach to DMing.

If any of you have played the video game ""Hand of Fate"", you'll probably have wished that it was an actual card game. I was getting ready to plan the next session of our campaign and honestly I had so much fun creating it to work by dealing out cards. Let me explain how this works:

***Using Land Cards to mark an ""Area""***

I decided to base the adventure off of different ""areas"" that would be randomly pulled from the deck, which consisted of 10 of each type of basic land card from Magic: The Gathering

(For those of you that don't play, the land types are swamp, forest, island, mountain, and plains).

Personally as a DM I like to leave a lot of space for improv, it stops me from railroading players and lets me be more flexible in how I run the game, so I only made loose notes on each location. I worked through the areas by rolling on the random tables which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/452r6r/a_massive_and_growing_resource_of_random_tables/) (Seriously check it out, it's amazing).

Here's an example area:

Sauster Volcano (Mountain)

Interesting Locations: A hole under a sheer cliff face, an ancient temple, a dark tunnel leading under the mountain.

Distinguishing Landmarks: A set of deliberately stacked stones, a group of stones arranged in a circle, and a swiftly flowing small stream.

Features: The name of a previous traveller, carved into a boulder. Snow flurries begin to fall. And a cache of abandoned, decrepit mining equipment.

* What’s in the hole under the cliff? A sleeping dragon (DC15 stealth check to not wake up)
* The temple was built to honour the Pact of the All-Consuming Scourge. 13 Darkmantles live in there now.
* What’s in the tunnel? An orc war band, fighting a manticore.

***Fleshing out the Areas***

So now you have the locations ready, and the random tables fill in a bit of information, but what about monsters? I'm sure you've all seen the random encounters tables in Xanithar's (If not check them out!) which is what I use, however I roll the encounters beforehand for the terrain.

This sometimes means it will be unbalanced against your party. My advice: Let it be unbalanced. Sometimes they will kill things without breaking a sweat which makes the party feel like the powerful heroes they are! Other times, they will come up against things that could crush them just as easy, having these creatures in gives the game a sense of realism.

Are monsters going to hang back until you gain a few levels? Of course not! This makes the game extra tense as they try to figure out ways to ""cheese"" the enemies that seem to difficult, or just simply go around them.

This, is perfectly okay - in fact I'd go as far as to say it makes more memorable moments! While yes it's all well and good just having a wall of hit-points that just hits them, and they hit back, can be interesting for those interested in the numbers, for those players who are more story driven they'll much prefer telling the story of ""...And then we brought a barrel of gunpowder to the top of the mountain to crush the giant under the rock-slide!"" than ""I hit it with an attack and it died."".

Let's put some random encounters on our previous example of Sauster Volcano:

Encounters (1d6):

* Encounter 1-2: A frost giant causing a rockslide
* Encounter 3-4: 8 Stirges buzzing around loose rocks that make for poor footing.
* Encounter 5-6: A troll shaman, it’s chanting causes a sudden storm bringing heavy snow.

***Rare bosses and loot (Optional)***

But then there's something else I like to add in to keep my players on their toes... I have a few Treasure token cards lying around, so I shuffled a few into the deck.

Does this mean you just give your party treasure that's been lying around? Nope.

Does this mean create a lair for a boss monster that actually uses the magic items against the players? Yes yes and yes.

These cards will be areas in their own right and will be placed onto the ""Map"" later. To make this effective, pick any creature that would be in the Hard or Deadly range for your party (Don't have the time? There’s a lot of random generators out there that help!). Then give that creature any magic item you would be willing to give the party, and make sure the monster uses it!

The decision that you get to watch the players make as they weigh up how badly they want that shot at some good loot against how tough this creature is and that it will be using the item. (If you're using the random tables from before, have a look at ""Strange Places"" for the lair)

***Actually running the session***

Now comes to how it actually plays out. First place down the ""starting card"" and roll to find what area they're in (I usually prepare about 3 of each type ahead of time). Then, if they travel for as long as you see fit to cross a mountain range, forest or the like then go ahead and place down a card next to it, in tandem of wherever they said they wanted to go (Above the card for north, to the right if they said east, etc). This lays out a sort of visual map for everyone, if they go one step further to get a high vantage point, then go ahead and lay down a card in each direction from the card they're currently on.

Here's a small example of the kind of ""Maps"" that get generated:  
 Key: \[F\] = Forest Card, \[P\] = Plains, \[M\] = Mountains, \[S\] = Swamp, \[I\] = Islands.

DM: Okay you start in a forest! \[f\]

*After a bit of the play, the players decide the want to push north, the DM draws a Mountain card and places it down above the card. The ""Map"" now looks like this:*

\[m\]

\[f\]

*The players find a way to get a good vantage point to see their surroundings, various other cards are drawn and placed around the mountain. The map now looks like this:*

\----\[f\]----

\[s\]\[m\]\[p\]

\----\[f\]----

***It doesn't have to be MTG cards***

The cards are simply a way to pull out random areas and keep track of where they all are in relation to each other, you can replace the cards with regular playing cards or any other tokens you can think of.

This method of running a session keeps everything organic and fluid, and spices up the DM life too! I'd love to hear all of your opinions on this style of play, along with any other ideas you guys might have!",1,Building Encounters with Cards
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,64,254,"I recently began a new open-world campaign for a table of players who do not like the standard XP system at all.

I only knew one of the players at the table beforehand, so provided a short Session 0 survey to learn about their playing preferences, expectations, and styles. They unanimously picked milestone leveling, and provided a variety of reasons as to why they did not like standard XP.

This was a small problem as there are no clear milestones in an open world campaign. While I could make it work with enough hand-waving and ""this feels about right"", I wanted to reward exploration and roleplay as well as combat and avoid the tendency to simply ""get through the narrative to get levels"" that milestone leveling can induce.

So I sat down and wrote some guidelines for a simplified advancement system that is tracked openly by the DM at the table, and which has just enough structure to give feedback to the players as to their progression: [Quest Experience](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rk-Xlug9NV).

At the first session, the players got the concept immediately and it did not get in the way of game play at all. In the first 4 hours, they pretty quickly role played their way to 3 QP due to great RP and exploration before hitting the first combat encounter. 

Feedback on the session was good from the table, so I thought I would share it here as well in case others are looking for, or using, something similar.",1,Quest Experience: A streamlined leveling mechanic
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,141,516,"Luck is rolled with the other ability scores and can be used in two ways. 

First is by the dm who asks the players to do a ""Luck save"". If you as a dm has trouble deciding which player should be targeted by an effect like spell, trap or other hazardous thing.
You have them roll a luck save and adding their Luck modifier to the roll, lowest roll gets targeted by the effect.
It can of course be used for any other scenario where it would make sense for ""Luck"" to play a role. It can be used in a positive way as well.

Other way is the players choosing to ""test their luck""

It works by the player declaring that they want to test their luck to succeed on an action they failed at (ability check, saving throw or attack roll), the player then rolls a d20 and must roll their Luck score or lower.
If they roll above nothing happens.
 If they roll the number of their luck score they succeed on their roll.
If they roll below their luck score they succeed as well but have to REDUCE their Luck score by one.

So example: A player has a luck score of 12 (+1) modifier.

If he makes a luck save he adds +1 to they roll.

If he decides to test his luck and Roll 13 or more nothing changes about his original failed roll.
If he rolls 12 he succeeds on the original roll and the score stays unchanged.
If he rolls 11 or lower he succeeds buts have to reduce his luck score by one, ending up with 11 instead of 12.

Only way to increase Luck is by being given from the DM as a reward or increasing it with ASI.

This is of course not for every table but I have used it one session so far and the players liked it and I will keep improving on it.

I'm considering adding a new luck feat that improves luck score and gives proficiency in Luck saving throws.


Edit: Ok a lot of comments saying that the luck is already in the dice, yes of course.
 But it's more about the mechanic than it being a simulation Luck. 
 I get a tool to decide who gets targeted sometimes or if the player finds a random thing they are looking for. The players get an extra resource to spend to help them succeed in really critical situations. It's a very limited resource. The number you put as luck is all you get. Unless I reward it or you spend ASI which would be bad use since it's better to just buff your main stats and they don't deplete with usage as Luck does.
But I feel no need to disallow it if someone really wants to spend it like that, but I won't recommend it.

Also it's not as slow as people think it is. You call for luck saves rarely when you can't decide and it's game changing moment like a high level spell or dangerous trap. Not every single scenario.
 And the Luck score is very limited and not something you waste every fight but use for those critical moments.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,18,221,"How to read this post:

* Those interested in challenges for players can skip right to the meat in **Floor** sections, **Context** may help you understand what is this all about.
* Fluff buffs will like to read the **Context** and **Lore**.
* If you want to lift the whole dungeon and run it, you can use the text in italics as environment descriptions.
* EDIT: I have already run this thing. It went well. I received some pretty negative feedback down in the comments. Apparently I am sadist GM ;-). So I am adding notes to the floor descriptions on what my players did and how they overcame the challenges. Also some ways for the sacrifices to be circumvented.

**What is this dungeon about:**

It is a Egyptian themed, tomb dungeon that was set up by its builders as evaluation and a test, not as a deadly trap to keep its secrets and treasures forever.

# Context

There is a McGuffin beneath the Dungeon. The McGuffin is a remnant of an Ancient Desert Civilisation. Their society was doomed and they knew it. So they hid their most powerful treasure beneath a Pyramid lost in the eternal sands of desert wastes. It was empty and devoid of life even then. But they were not selfish enough to destroy the McGuffin. They constructed the Pyramid to test those that would come after them. If they are deemed worthy then they would be allowed to leave with the McGuffin.

Because the gods themselves were against them they severed the connection to other Planes. Even from the Ethereal Plane. That means everybody who dies in the Pyramid instantly becomes Undead and they are bound to the place as its guardian (in my world that means the soul is tethered - it can not go on into the afterlives). That includes all the original builders and workers - they consigned themselves to suffer undeath, so that the place remains secret. The builders were smart and cunning, but that did not save them from their doom.

Now after thousands of years it was found by the PCs.

# Lore

In my world Dragons and Giants are locked in an eternal conflict for world domination. As they are beings with lifespans counted in thousands of years and reaching immense power, they are the true masters of this world. But the increased lifespans also mean generally less fertility so loses of the War are recouped slowly. There are times of extended non-aggression when the conflict fades into myth and legends and the smaller races get to flourish. Unfortunately every time a new bout of the War erupts it is an all out apocalyptic event for the mortals. Their kingdoms are trampled below the foots of Giants like sandcastles under a high tide and whats left is burned by dragons in their unsatiable hunger for destruction.     
Ossiria was Yuan-Ti empire that rose in a region of no strategic importance for both sides of the conflict, as such it had a head start when the War stopped again. They irrigated their desert with a waters of the Great River. They built a great civilization. And they lasted for a long time. Their god was Rah - the Sun Snake.     
One day their god took a form most holy of a snake-headed man and descended amongst them. He showed them visions of the War. He foretold them their destruction. But he loved them so, that he would not allow his people to perish as so many before them. He showed them ways of great arcane power. He taught them the ways of life and death. He told them of Soul Magic. And they were afraid but they loved their god and themselves. They agreed to a method most extreme.     
They would build an army of the dead that would defend Ossiria from both Giants and Dragons.     
From then on every man and woman from the day of their 15th Great River flood were building their own grave. Their own sarcophagus to be buried in. But these were not mere coffins, they were colossi of desert sandstone and bronze and Great Oasis ironwood and the Great River clay mixed with their blood baked with the holy fire of Rah. The soul of Ossiria and their life's work. The rich were no longer competing for the greatest tomb to signify their passing. In this grim determination number of colossi in their guard marked their status. If a slave wanted to build a colossi, he was freed as only free people could choose to join the Legions of Ossiria. Each colossus when activated would bound its creator's soul and they would stand guard over the Ossiria.     
But the soul could power the colossus only for so long before being unable to do so anymore. Their vigil was to be unending as was the War. To preserve the souls of the Legions, four artifacts were created: the Helm, the Shield, the Bow and the Sword, each with a blessing of Rah. Four most experienced warriors were chosen to guard them until the time came to unleash the Legions. This went on for centuries.     
What Rah didn't tell his people was that every soul closed in the artifacts and not coming to him was diminishing his power. Yet he still was most powerful of mortal gods. But other gods were spiteful of Rah's power and they hated necromancy. So they schemed. They found a mortal, a pharaoh young and ambitious that was not going to be marginalized by magepriests and a literal word of his god. He was tempted and he was convinced by a young succubi in a guise of an angel. He seized the bow, he seized the shield and when Rah appeared to bless his followers, he wounded the god with these weapons.Shocked and weakened Rah retreated, but he was not able to defend himself against other gods who have then slain him. They then opened a portal to primordial chaos and summoned forth a Spirit of Water only to fill it with malevolent intent.     
From then on Great River that gave life to Ossiria became a deadly scourge, killing everything in its path to drain every precious drop of water from every living creature and then lose it to the sands of the desert. Ossiria was destroyed in months. Three of artifacts of Rah, the insignia of Legions were lost. Nobody heard of the young pharaoh again.     
Last surviving Legion commander with his magepriests and guard saw the doom of Ossiria. They were filled with grief and sadness, What they could do, when all that they sacrificed so much to protect was destroyed? After deliberation they decided to hide the Legion, for one day they may be called to fulfill their purpose in destroying the Dragons and Giants both. The guards sacrificed their lives to power the ward that would protect Legion's burial ground. The magepriests entombed themselves to forever guard the entrance. The legion commander was left with the task most dire. He stays alive at the bottom of the tomb forever bound to the place, with the Helm in hand, waiting for people worthy of calling the Last Legion of Ossiria.

# The Exterior

&gt;*Before you extends a view of the small green valley hidden among the sands of the desert. It seems unlikely that this small patch of greenery has resisted the wandering dunes. However, the smell of moisture in the air is unmistakable.*  
*Among the palm trees you see rocks protruding above the sands and overgrown mud. A regular shape of the golden pyramid pierces through the irregular line of rock. The surface of the polished sandstone is covered with sigils that are illegible from this distance. The very top of the pyramid is black like coal.*

To get to the Pyramid you have to get through a patch of terrain that is a magical warding desert. DC25 Survival Check or equivalent is required to get through it. If the PCs know the general location of the Pyramid they can repeat the check every few days (timeframe determined by GM), as long as they can survive the desert long enough.

&gt;*When you approach an oasis, you see a small lake whose waters are spreading around, sustaining vegetation and few birds. A parrot screech disturbs the silence of the desert. You quickly see a small stream coming out of the rocks that brings life to the entire area.*   
*The entrance to the pyramid dominates the vista. Two massive columns support a gigantic block of sandstone over a black rectangular hole that leads inside. The entire structure is strictly geometric and decorated with glyphs few centimeters deep. The winding paths of glyphs look elegant compared to the brutal simplicity of the pyramid.*  
*Above the entrance, signs in many scripts ​​are engraved. You recognize the alphabets of draconic, giant, elven, dwarven and a few scripts that you do not know. Each says ""Here rests the Last Legion of Ossiria"".*

If examined with a DC15 Arcana Check the glyphs marking the structure reveal that they are a powerful ward against elements, magical location and travel. A DC20 Arcana Check reveals also that they ward against teleportation and planar travel.

# First Floor

&gt;*You traverse a short corridor, your eyes accommodating slowly to the darkness around you. The walls are a simple cut sandstone, but after first few steps you see a threshold a strange where crudely worked stone transitions into perfectly polished almost reflective surface. It is the same sandstone but it seems to have been worked tirelessly into perfect smoothness.* (characters that can use Divine magic feel a strange transition when going through, DC13 Perception Check will determine that there is no dust after the threshold) *After that the corridor continues for another 20 feet only to be open to a single great chamber.*  
*In the middle of the room there is a 4 feet recession where you can see a desiccated fountain. At its center a small pedestal with a statue depicting a beautiful woman with a vase in one hand and a brightly shining gem illuminating the chamber with dim orange light.* (DC 13 Perception Check will reveal that in addition to small scales etched into her body her eyes have vertical pupils.) *Around the room there are 20 obsidian black doors, whose surface is covered with hieroglyphics. Above the doors and on the ceiling there are beautiful and insanely detailed mosaics.* (Comprehend Languages reveals that each is a burial chamber of a priest, describes their life in sparse detail and ends with “Forever he will stand vigilant”).   
*The circumference of the fountain is covered in mix of scripts like the stone above the entrance to the pyramid.*  
***They all say “What is in my pocket?”***

This is an entrance level to the pyramid. After short corridor characters enter a room with a 4 mosaics depicting the history of Ossiria up to the point of Rah teaching them about magic. If examined closely the mosaics seem to consist of microscopic specks that are polished to perfection like all the floors and objects around you. A DC15 Glassworking Check or equivalent will reveal that the image consists of individual grains of colored sand pressed together, slightly melted in place and grinded to a high polish afterwards, the work of such detail and size must have taken dozens of years to be finished. After the threshold is crossed the transportation magic and divination magic to perceive outside world stop working. You can choose to include short distance travel and planar spells like Banishment and Dimension Doors but it is not necessary. I will be treating the extraplanar spaces like Bags of Holding as if they were in antimagic zone. The players can fiddle in the room as they please.

They may try to answer the riddle by declaring aloud “In your pocket is ….” or a similar phrase.

Every time they answer some of the 20 doors will open and out go Mummies of the priests. 1 per door. I will be using Mummy statblock. The mummies are preserved perfectly but there is visible battle damage on them. After destroying each mummy a spirit will leave its body sinking into the floor of the chamber. You can increase their AC and movement speed to account for Necromantic mastery of their creators and all the gold jewellery that they are clad with. After first answer 3 doors will open. After second answer 4 doors will open. After that 5 doors will open then and lastly 8 doors will open.

The trick is they have to realise that riddle is not a honest one. You just have to keep answering until you open all the doors. If you want to scale this tomb down, you could use whatever Undead, you feel your party can handle in numbers outlined above.

**What my players did:** They figured out that there is no solution to the riddle or at least that they can not solve it. So after the first wave they started shouting the solutions to open all the doors as fast as they could. Then AoE from Spiritual Guardians and corner defense destroyed the Mummies. Thanks to high ACs and Dodge they would have stomped the Mummies but I managed to bring the Cleric to the ground with Shove attacks (mummies are quite strong) so it was close. You do not want a mob of mummies to clobber you with advantage.  
**What they could do:** Destroy each door physically. If they have the appropriate tools it can be done without any checks. Each single Mummy would be a pushover, so they could kill them easily. After 1d20 doors opened they would find the switch that opens the passage down.

After all the doors are opened, and priests dispatched the fountain floor will recede opening into a long dark tunnel. It is approximately 50 meters (150 feet) long and its walls are polished like the floor around you. If characters are able to see so far into the shaft they can see water below bottom end of the shaft. An object thrown down will make a splashing sound. They can descend the shaft, but ascending without climbing tools or something that could damage the walls enough for pitons to be placed is impossible. Even then it is a 25DC Climbing check. If they jump down they will take falling damage from hitting the water but not enough to kill any party member. I recommend 3d6-4d6 damage for uninterrupted fall.

# Second Floor

&gt;*You find yourselves in a 15 foot deep reservoir of water. It is clean and fresh. The stairs lead out of the pool. In this chamber 4 pairs of doors show the paths out of the room in four cardinal directions. East, south, west and north. The chamber and doors are not embellished in any way.*

Doors can be opened with a DC20 Strength check but when characters open them a sound of stone grinding on stone can be heard and 1/4th of the shaft entrance leading up to the first floor is blocked. If they open all four doors they will be sealed in the tomb.

**What my players did:** They placed a immovable rod to stop the entrance from closing of their retreat.  
**What they could do:** Anything similar nonmagical like stops or wedges.

&amp;#x200B;

**East Doors - Sacrifice of Wealth**

&gt;*You enter a chamber that holds nothing but a great furnace. The heat emanating from it is unnatural and the flames inside seem to burn without fuel. On the sides of it you can see in many scripts “Sacrifice of Wealth”. Below the furnace there is a deep carved rune that could be filled with whatever was melted in the furnace. Wall behind the furnace is covered with a great mosaic depicting a building of an army of stone giants. Poor and rich figures with golden freckled skin are depicted as building them, all below the watching eyes of a snake-headed sun god. The gold jewellery is shown melted to fill the bones of the giants. Precious gems sacrificed in rituals to infuse them with power. Beautiful temples and palaces are destroyed and giant blocks of sandstone are turned into limbs and torsos.*

To activate the rune, characters must throw enough precious metals into the furnace. The gold from the priest above is not enough. Scale this as you feel appropriate for your player’s wealth level. The sacrifice should be significant. It is a jab at the greedy players. The gold disappears after activating the rune. If characters destroy the furnace 1d4+1 Fire Elementals are unleashed.

**What my players did:** They just retreated behind the no planar travel zone and got their gold out of bags of holding.  
**What they could do:** They figured out that any precious metal works and could use copper, only volume is important. But turns out they didn't have any. Only platinum and gold so it cost them dearly.

When the **first rune is activated** half of the water in a central reservoir will be drained and a part of its bottom will rise to reveal a half-dome of force covering a throne on which sits a Mummy Lord, he holds a big ornate key.The reservoir should be shown as refilling itself at a time fast enough to prevent short or long rests.

&amp;#x200B;

**South Doors - Sacrifice of Life**

&gt;*This chamber holds nothing but a black obsidian bowl. Runes are etched all around its surface. The script on the floor says “Sacrifice of Life” The mosaic behind the bowl shows a great army of colossi stand unused when Ossirians defend their homeland against invasions of beastmen and other races.*

To activate the rune the characters have to fill it with blood. The amount of HP lost is determined by the GM and it should be significant for their level.

When **second rune activates** the central reservoir is drained totally but the refilling doesn’t stop. The barrier around the Mummy Lord shimmers and loses a layer.

**What my players did:** I set the HP cost at 75HP. They floundered and were hesitant to pay the cost. They used some healing potions (based on blood magic) and they have worked.  
**What they could do:** No idea really. They considered getting the Paladin's summoned camel into the pyramid and convincing it to sacrifice itself. The answer to that is ""Maybe?"". Depends how you interpret physicality of summoned beings. Willing hirelings were always the option.

&amp;#x200B;

**West Doors – Sacrifice of Magic**

&gt;*This chamber holds nothing but a big sledge hammer. It is also covered in runes. The script says “Sacrifice of Magic”. The wall behind it depicts Rah transferring bits of his power into 4 artifacts: Shield, Helm, Bow, Sword crafted by the priests. His halo is visibly smaller than on the other mosaics but each artifacts is then depicted with its own small halo.*

To charge the hammer you have to smash physical, magical objects with it. The Eternal Flame from the statue up from the First Floor is not enough. The power of the magic item determines its effect. The GM judges if the sacrifice is enough. If they manage to smash the hammer with itself (especially without transportation magic) they win DnD.

**What my players did:** They destroyed some shitty magical item and when it was not enough, they figured out that it only needs physical magical object. So they smashed the Blood Bowl and some wards around the throne behind the North Doors.  
**What they could do:** No idea. They gamed that pretty well.

When **third rune activates** a keyhole in the floor of central reservoir is revealed. The barrier around the Mummy Lord shimmers and loses its penultimate layer.

**The North Doors – Sacrifice of Soul**

&gt;*This chamber holds a dry, tortured corpse of a humanoid chained to the stone chair with manacles and chains. The throne is surrounded by three layers of magic circle. Remains of its skin have a sickly purplish color and its weird deformed skull has remains of 4 tentacles growing out of it. It looks at you with empty eyesockets. In your heads you hear: “Give me your pain, give me your happiness, give me what you hold precious”. Behind it there is a mosaic depicting Ossirians souls being locked in the Artifacts. Their halos are bigger, while the Rah halo is smaller.*

To unlock the last seal players have to sacrifice a level in XP. Depending on your party it can be a trivial challenge (6 characters) or a serious setback (with 2 players). But the most important part of this is RP, your players have to describe the important moment from their character story that their character is giving up. If it connects them with their comrades it is better because the others can remember it still. The corpse is an Alhoon.When it is satisfied it will unlock its seal. If they choose to destroy the Alhoon it is restrained to the chair but it is still able to use most of its spellcasting. If necessary downgrade this encounter by having the Alhoon fragmented for example only a torso and a head are strapped to the chair giving it less HP, etc. I used the stats of the Mind Flayer.

**What my players did:** Rogue gave him a ball with memories of a powerful wizard. It gave him enough power to Dominate the rogue and try to escape. One sliced Alhoon in pieces and some promises of freedom later, he asked for only 1 memory. Without an XP cost cause they hated that. They killed him anyway.  
**What they could do:** A psionic character could just activate the rune by himself. Other that it is pretty much up to the negotiation with the Alhoon.

When the **fourth rune activates** the Mummy Lord is released from its force field. It will face characters in battle. When defeated its spirit will phase through the floor and the key it was holding can be inserted into a keyhole on the bottom of the pool. That unlocks the staircase in the bottom of the floor.Scale it down by making the Mummy Lord a Wight or an illusion.

# Third Floor

&gt;*Stepping out of shallow puddle of water that trickled from the pool above you see a dead end chamber with only a giant brazier in the middle its heat makes it hard to breathe, but there is no smoke or fumes. The walls are covered with inscriptions in many languages. You recognize some of them as dead dialects of the languages you know.*  
*Piecing them together with your combined linguistic skills you decipher their meaning. They all say one and the same thing ""Only through fire and death you can reach the Legion"".*  
*Spots on the walls not covered in various script are painted with images depicting figures throwing themselves into the fire and suffering greatly. Faces deformed into exaggerated expressions of pain and terror. Horrible burns on their bodies painted with excruciating details.*  
*They seem to silently scream at you in their torment. The ceiling is covered with a mosaic that shows the fall of Ossiria, killing of Rah and the construction of pyramid.*   
*In one of the walls you can see a door. It says:*   
*""Extinguish the fire,*  
 *if escape you desire,*  
 the *darkness will cover your shame,*  
 *but we will remember your name""*

To proceed you have to kill yourself and destroy your body. That is the final test - are you determined enough to lay down your life for the cause? When you die, you become undead, but when your body is destroyed, your soul is unbound.As a spectre/unbound soul, you can pass through walls and rock down into the chamber of the Guardian.

Because being closed inside the tomb with only choice to go forward would invalidate the player's agency there is a  way to back if examined the walls will reveal a door that allows them to escape but at the same time it blocks the way forward. If they extinguish the flame they can escape with a staircase upwards to an exit just next to the fountain on First Floor. They can then remove the ""trapdoor"" with DC20 Strength Check (can be repeated). This passage is impossible to see from the other side due to the stone being set permanently and polished with the rest of the floor.

**What my players did:** One of them jumped in the brazier. I ended session there.  
**What they could do:** What they could do. Cast Darkness on the escape door or totally cover it with some material to block out the light of the brazier. That would open the escape route without closing the way forward. Try to brute force their entrance by just digging down. 

# Fourth Floor

&gt;*You pass through the rock and stone of the Pyramid. It is a strange, disturbing sensation as you push through slightly shimmering matter. Down and down. Below you see a myriad of lights, a strange landscape in ethereal, with a central light so strong you want to run away. Above you the structure of the Pyramid is fading in the distance, all around you the spectres of the undead you slain follow you silently. No, not slain. You have freed them. As you approach the singular light they scatter. It is not blinding anymore. It is a room, a physical location deep below the desert.*  
*As you step into the chamber you can see an old woman in a lotus position in the middle of the floor. The Helm rests in her lap. She still breathes. When you enter the room she opens her eyes and looks at you with empty stare. Her mouth doesn't move, but in your head you hear a voice.*   
*Commanding. Judging. Evaluating.*    
*""Why are you here?""*

The characters pass through the rock and stone of the Pyramid to the chamber below to encounter the Guardian. She is the commander of the lost Legion. She makes the final decision.   
**DISCLAIMER:** My Player Characters do not have personalities, goals and players that would cause the Guardian to instakill them. You can have the Guardian have any personality you want, but in my case it is an old meditative woman who sacrificed so much to her cause that it is a singular ultimate objective. But she is not a monster and will not kill more than she needs to. She also has a great curiosity for the world outside. She was taking her time creating incredible art that only an immortal can dedicate too but that can only occupy her so much. She has the ability to Glide Through Stone inside the Pyramid so she maintains it and if needed resets everything.  

The PCs can talk with her freely. Her objective is to get rid of the dragons and giants. But if you offer her a way to restore Ossiria you will have her heart.  If she deems the PCs unworthy she kills them. If she doesn’t want to kill them she will modify their memory and ressurects them outside of the pyramid with a load of loot or empty hands. If she deems them worthy she will let them leave with the memory of what happened inside. It all depends on her evaluation of the character she interacts with. If the characters convince her that they offer real chance to stop the War she will rise the Last Legion of Ossiria to be at their disposal. If so you can treat her as allied level 20 (Monk 15 Fighter 5).

**Hardcore mode:** If you really hate your players, you can have her control the Pyramid manually observing the characters from within the stone and activating or deactivating the elements at will. It would make all the attempts at ""hacking the Pyramid"" fruitless. Then be sure to adjust her personality to ""slightly malicious"".

Any comments, suggestions? I would especially like to find a better non-riddle than ""What is in your pocket?""",1,The Last Legion Tomb - a low lethality dungeon to guard your McGuffin
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,132,1386,"I like exciting pulp-action combat, but standard 5e D&amp;D combat can grow stale quick. So here is my simple combat rules ""plug-in"" to spice up the game for everyone.

These are codified from a few years DMing with these rules in an informal way. I now call them Gambits, feel free to use this concept wholesale or just steal the core concepts and run with your own. The goal is to make combat more fun and exciting without bogging down in too many rules. 


## Tactical Gambits

The tactical gambit rules presented here are opt-in mechanical layer on top of normal 5e combat rules that allow players and foes to attempt heroic maneuvers typically depicted in fiction. 

The design prerogative of these options is to not change the balance of the game; and they are not meant to replace or invalidate any core rules like fighting styles, feats, existing combat actions, or classes like the battle master and their maneuvers.

Semantically a gambit is *when someone sacrifices a resource or an opportunity in order to achieve a potential upper hand in a conflict*. The gambits presented here allow a player to trade advantage or to take disadvantage on their attack roll for potential tactical benefits. This means that gambit benefits are curbed by the choice of taking a gamble. Thus both a player that actively embraces gambits, and a player that prefers to play it safe will be roughly equal in combat.

### Using Tactical Gambits
Once per turn, when you do not already have disadvantage on an attack, you can choose to perform a gambit while performing an attack by taking disadvantage to the attack. If you had advantage on the attack the gambit counters your advantage and you roll normally.

On a successful hit, in addition to the normal damage of your attack you can apply the benefits of the gambit you chose.

Additionally, as an optional rule, you may trade extra damage dice on a successful critical hit to use a gambit, however you must decide to do so before you roll any damage dice.

---
**Aimed shot.** *Range attacks only.* You take the time to aim extra carefully before shooting. You can ignore up to three-quarters cover on the attack. However because of your focus you cannot take attacks of opportunity until the start of your next turn. 

---
**Arm Injury.** On a successful hit you slightly injure the target's arm, or an equivalent appendage. The target has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

---
**Bash Shield.** On a successful hit you push aside the target's shield. The target cannot benefit from the protection of their shield until the start of its next turn.

---
**Careful Attack.** *Melee attacks only.* You attack very carefully. The next attack against you has disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

---
**Dig the wound.** If the target is already missing any of its hit points before your attack, you can aim for a weak point in it's defenses, roll a d4 and add it to the damage.

---
**Disorient.** On a successful hit you disorient the target, and it moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

---
**Distract.** The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of the target's next turn.

---
**Flat of the Blade.** *Melee attacks only.* You adjust your combat style to change the damage type of your weapon. You can choose to change the damage of your attack to bludgeoning, piercing or slashing.

---
**Hamstring** On a successful hit the target begins limping. It must spend an additional foot for every foot it moves until the end of its next turn. 

---
**Head hit, or Gut punch.** On a successful hit the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

---
**Reckless Lunge.** *Melee attacks only* You increase the reach of your attack by 5 feet before the attack.

---
**Mock, or Trick** *Requires Charisma 13 or higher.* On a successful hit the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you, as well as any Wisdom checks it performs before the end of its next turn.

---
**Pin Down.** After a successful hit against the target you can use a bonus action to pin the target to the ground, a wall, or another large object. A pinned creature is considered grappled by the object it is pinned to until it uses an action, or bonus action to free it's self, or the end of its next turn when it automatically breaks free.

---
**Pot shots.** *Range attacks only.* You aim carelessly for easy shots on nearby targets. After your attack you can use your bonus action to perform a second attack on a separate target, this second attack also suffers disadvantage. Both attacks must be performed on targets within 10-feet of you.

---
**Push.** *Melee attacks only.* On a successful hit you can push a target, that is of your size or smaller, 5-feet back while pursuing the target 5-feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction is blocked, you and the target don't move.

---
**Pull, or Lure.** *Melee attacks only.* On a successful hit you can move 5-feet away from the target and pull the same target, if it is of your size or smaller, 5-feet towards you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction is blocked, you and the target don't move.

---
**Ricochet.** *Range attacks only.* You aim for a ricochet hit in an attempt to catch the target off guard. When performing a ricochet, you need line of sight to a surface or object that has line of sight to the target. When you perform a ricochet attack you ignore half cover and any shield bonus to AC the target might have.

---
**Tricky Pass.** *Melee attacks only.* When performing an attack of opportunity against a moving target you can perform a pass. On a successful hit you force the target to spend it's movement to move 5-feet in any direction of your choice. This forced movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

---
**Unbalance.** After a successful hit against the target loses their balance. The target has disadvantage on checks, and saves to avoid being moved or forced prone until the start of it's next turn.

This is my first little homemade dungeon as a new DM. I'm running a game of Lost Mines for some friends of mine and I was unsatisfied with Old Owl Well, and wanted to make it a bit more interesting. 

I redesigned the Side Quest so that Hamun Kost was there looking for the Lab, but accidentally releases the Undead trapped inside it. The dungeon can be incorporated easily elsewhere by just changing the name of the Mage to someone else. When I was thinking up the premise for the Dungeon, I felt that even though the world is in a Fantasy setting that there had to still be ""Desk Job"" locations scattered around. So, I took some light office humor and some inspiration from the first Resident Evil Movie and came up with this. 

Beneath the Tower of Old Owl Well, a long abandoned and exclusive Magical Research Laboratory is lost to time. As adventurers explore what remains of the levels of the facility, they'll discover strange experiments, unusual magical items, and uncover the mystery of what tragic event caused this secretive corporation to fall.",1,Dungeon: Tinkerfitz Labs

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,46,168,"While DMing, the following situation has come up with my groups multiple times:

&amp;nbsp;

Player: This (ice/undead/water/etc.) creature should be weak against (fire/radiant/lightning/etc.) damage so I'm gonna use this spell/weapon/tactic!

*thinking to myself* That makes sense, let's check the vulnerabilities. Hmm, nope, no vulnerability (because RAW there are very few).

Me: That was clever, but you don't see any indication that your attack was any more effective than the others.

*Player is disappointed*

&amp;nbsp;

In the Monster's Manual, there are only 20 creatures with a vulnerability and almost half of them are fire (according to [this post](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?379165-MM-Resistances-Immunities-Vulnerabilities-and-Damage)). It does not have to be this way. Maybe it's the Pokemon I grew up on speaking, but certain creatures should have certain types of damage affect them differently. I want my players to think creatively in battle and reward them for coming up with strategies that should work.

My solution? Give monsters vulnerabilities (x2 damage to a certain damage type, for those of you unaware) but bump their HP accordingly so as to not change their CR. Specifically, I bump their HP according to how many members of the party have significant access to one of the vulnerable damage types.

&amp;nbsp;

New HP = Old HP x (1 + (# of players with access to vulnerable damage / # of players))

&amp;nbsp;

Let's take the Winter Wolf, for example. Its listed HP is 75. It makes sense that it would be vulnerable to fire. So you give it a vulnerability to fire. But 2 of your 5 players have access to fire damage, so you need to calculate it's new, equivalent HP. 

&amp;nbsp;

New HP = 75 * (1 + (2/5)) = 104

&amp;nbsp;

And that's it. You've just made a more realistic, more fun encounter. Your players get to feel like geniuses for figuring out the weak spot and badasses for having the power to exploit it.

&amp;nbsp;

Some good examples off the top of my head:

Water Elementals vulnerable to lightning

Earth Elementals vulnerable to bludgeoning/thunder

Rug of Smothering vulnerable to slashing

Ankheg vulnerable to piercing (stabbing at the joints of its chitinous plates)

Plant creatures to poison

&amp;nbsp;

Potential objections addressed ahead of time:

&gt; This is needlessly complex!

Eh, maybe. I think the added verisimilitude and incentive for creativity in battle is worth the extra minute to recalculate HP, however.

&gt; This discourages spellcasters from specializing in one damage type!

Yup. I think that's a feature, not a bug. Variety is fun. Maybe some of the lesser used spells (RIP Melf's Acid Arrow) get some spotlight.

&gt; This buffs spellcasters because they have access to more damage types than martials!

Potentially. You do have to be careful to include the bludgeoning, piercing, slashing trio an appropriate amount. Adding these damage types regularly also has the bonus of giving martials an extra decision to make. ""Should I try my maul because it looks like it might be effective?"" I will also occasionally give pseudo-vulnerability to one of the BPS by just adding +3/5/10/etc. damage to every hit of that type.

&gt; Resistances already have this covered! Any damage that isn't resisted is already highly effective!

Yes, in theory. But it's a lot more fun as a player to have your damage doubled than it is to have it not halved.

&gt; Your way of calculating the new HP gives it too much/little extra health!

It's worked for me rather well so far and it's simple. I don't think the difference in HP between my calculation and the perfect ideal of true adjusted HP is enough to make a significant difference. It's one attack at most.

&amp;nbsp;

That's all I got! I've used this system in ~20 encounters, so still a small sample size. Let me know if you've done anything similar, or if you have any critiques or questions.  Thanks for reading!",1,On Vulnerabilities and How to Implement Them (Relatively) Easily

&amp;#x200B;",1,The Portal Resource
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,47,627,"We as Dungeon Masters put a lot of work into our worlds. We slave away countless hours adding details that the players won't even see because we think it is fun. And then we let the party into our world and none of them care about the world and feel like there are no stakes. Today I want to talk about how to get your players to care about the world around them, and make them feel like they are not only in the world but also a part of it. 

#Impacting NPC's

The most important element that the PC's will ever interact within your worlds are the NPC's. A setting by itself can be cool, but the people that inhabit it are the lifeblood of any plane and are primarily what the PC's will be interacting with. In order to make the players care about your world, you need to make them feel like their actions have consequences. 

Showing these consequences is simply a matter of having the NPC's say something about it. When the players kill all of the local rats, have the local barkeep say something about how nice it is not having to deal with vermin all the time. Have people thank the players for saving them. **Show the party that they made the world a better place, and they will want to make the world even better. **

You can also heighten the tension of a story by showing that the party's actions, as well-intentioned as they may be, are ultimately bad for the local townsfolk. If the party is going after a local mob boss, you can show how ruthless the boss is by having the mob attack the party even with other innocent people there. They can get hurt and even killed, and you can drive the point home by saying if the party wasn't going after the mob boss, nothing bad would have happened. 

The point I am trying to make here is to have consequences for what the players do, both good and bad. If all of the consequences that the players see are negative, they will start to develop a sense of apathy for the world around them. If all the consequences are positive, the story will lose its dramatic tension. A proper balance will help the party to feel that what they do matters, and hopefully, drive them to do their best. 

#Give Them a Home

Give the players a place that they can modify as much as they want, and they will love it. In my first campaign the players cleared out an abandoned castle that was full of undead, and after they had killed everything there they surprised me and asked if they could keep it. Considering the previous owner was lying dead at their feet, I said yes and they immediately started asking so many questions such as ""how much it would cost to fix?"", ""can Mending be used to fix the entire castle?"", and ""what is the surrounding area like?"" They were so excited about this abandoned building, and once I started letting them make changes to it they become extremely invested in the world. 

Giving your players a place to live and make their own is something that they will really appreciate. For many players who are new to Dnd, the idea of taking a location and doing anything they want to it may not even occur to them. Give them the idea that they have complete freedom, and you'll get them thinking about the game even outside of the session. 

After they have had it for a while, you can start to introduce NPC's and build up the area around them. Once they become attached to it, you can even threaten it a little and send an army into the area that the players feel like they must stop because their home is in danger. Don't be too aggressive about attacking their home, however, as they may begin to resent you for it. 

#Conclusion

Showing your players that the actions they take have consequences does wonders for a world. It increases the verisimilitude and makes the players feel empowered about their actions and decisions. Having NPC's comment on how the world is safer thanks to them, or giving them a great big castle that they can modify however they want makes the players feel awesome and empowered. If you want to get your players attached to your world, make them feel like they can change it. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,202,2291,"Let's be honest here, Mazes in D&amp;D suck. And it's a real shame because nothing seems more iconic to a fantasy adventure than being lost in a labyrinth. Unfortunately, the feeling just doesn't translate well onto the tabletop.

In my experience playing D&amp;D there are a few ways to deal with mazes, none of them attractive. First, you can slowly plod through it in character, endlessly repeating yourself, ""You enter a small corridor, there is a path to the left and a path to the right... What do you do?"" until both you and your party have gone insane. Another and equally terrible option is to simply hand the players a map and have them relive kindergarten for a few moments as they plot their course out with a pen. The third and possibly worst option is to simply have the wizard roll an intelligence check, or the ranger a survival check and defeat the maze with a few dice rolls.
None of these methods do a proper labyrinth justice, so I've done my best to make an alternative.  In making this maze system I had a few design goals.

**Goal the first:** I want my players to be able to interact with the maze in a very clear and tactile way.

**Goal the second:** I want my players to make choices, and to feel like those choices mean something. (Can't feel random)

**Goal the third:** I want the ENTIRE party to have a chance to participate, using their skills, talents, and ideas.

**Goal the fourth:** I want the players to feel lost. At least to a degree.

**Goal the fifth:** This system needs to be open-ended enough to work for any setting the party is lost in, whether that be Underdark labyrinth, confusing fey forest, or twisting chaos dimension.

#All of this led me to employ my mediocre image editing skills to create a deck of custom cards, which can be downloaded [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vtrsnf9uvxae2hb/AADAJjZpwWzktftOn_LsG9zla?dl=0). #

(There is an easy to print PDF with all of the cards, as well as the full-scale PNGs of each, so you can have them printed or upload them into Roll20. Do with them as you wish.)

**With all that said, here are the rules to my labyrinth game:**

The way this game functions is the DM lays out a number of cards face down, each representing a possible path the players may take. The players then have 2 options:

They can attempt to flip a card and see what it represents. If the players wish to flip a card they must use some trick or skill in order to learn what is ahead. For example, a stealthy character might sneak ahead and scout, rolling a stealth check and on success, revealing the card. A wizard might attempt to use their arcana to scry ahead, or a cleric might pray for guidance. The options are only limited by the player's creativity and the DM's patience.

The second option is to simply bumble into the choice blindly, facing whatever consequences lay behind the card. When the players trigger a card without scouting it, they stumble into any traps and are seen by any monsters within. Likewise, players who scout ahead see the monster first, and spot the traps early.

Once the players have finished a card you simply discard that card and return the unchosen options to the deck to be shuffled before laying out another set of choices. The amount of choices you lay out is denoted by a small number over a door icon in the top right corner of the completed card.
There are two ways to finish the labyrinth, depended on GM whim. You could place an Exit Card in the deck when the players encounter this card they have the choice to complete the maze then and there. Or you could simply exhaust the deck, finishing the Labyrinth upon emptying it. A tricky DM could even wait until a predetermined number of encounters have been triggered before shuffling the Exit Card in secretly.
________________________

**Optional considerations:**

**Backtracking:** Players being players, they will ultimately want to do something unexpected, like return to that nice NPC, or lovely item stash they found a few cards ago. In this situation, I would simply have them make a check to navigate or remember their way, or whatever else they can offer, making the check more difficult the more choices they made between now and when they last were there.

**The common tricks:** A player will inevitably use one of the old “tried and true” methods for defeating a maze. Assuming the trick makes sense for the setting, (Breadcrumbs likely won’t help you if you’re in a twisted plane of chaos, for example.) you could grant the players some free reveals, or make backtracking easier. Reward ideas, but do not let them trivialize the whole labyrinth. 

**Populating the Labyrinth:** There are a few options when it comes to determining what are in the encounters once players trigger them. My preferred style is to create the encounters beforehand and put corresponding cards in the deck. However, if prep work is not your style you can easily get some random tables to roll whenever the party stumbles upon something.

**How to describe a labyrinth:** Another thing to consider is how you describe the labyrinth. I think it is important to make the layout of the options feel much more organic. You might be tempted to simply say: ""You come to a crossroads there are 4 options."" But this makes the maze feel very structured, like how one might plot a family tree. I would recommend something closer to this: ""As you explore the ruins beyond the chamber you find a number of possible paths... There is a hatch leading down into a long damp cellar, a wide stony corridor to your south, a staircase leading farther up beyond this room, or you could push further along the previous tunnel."" Both descriptions are functionally the same, but one feels like tracking a graph, the other feels like being lost in a dungeon. And to me that feeling of exploration is EVERYTHING.

#Note: your pantheon can be made of canon D&amp;D gods! 

You don't have to have custom deities to fill the ranks (Mine doesn't! I use most of the Dawn War pantheon). But this will be a project to build a custom framework for fitting in whatever specific gods you want! Those can be ones you've made up or ones like Bahamut and Tiamat. 

This round, we’re going to start taking a look at what defines those beings at the top of the religious food chain. For your world's pantheon, consider the following questions. 
___
1. Tell us a little bit about the space in which your gods exist. Do they have their own planes of existence? Are they omnipresent? Do your Greater Deities live in different places than your Lesser Deities?
2. How does divine power manifest in these spaces? Are there conflicts if the power of one deity overlaps with another's in these places?
3. If your gods live in distinct and separate locations, are there paths that connect them? What do those look like? 
4. If it's possible, how do mortals to travel to these places? If a mortal is able to get there, how do they leave? If this isn't possible, why is it impossible and what is the closest a mortal could get?

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,110," Hello!

I've lurked here many years and thought I might finally post something. I've been running a homebrew campaign for a few months and thought that I would share one of my puzzles with you guys. The setting is in a cave with a wizard who is trying to drain magic energy from a captured dragon to power a gigantic stone golem. To foreshadow the final boss fight I thought to put in a puzzle involving statues and runes.

Note that I did make the statues' requirements solveable by my party, so if it doesn't work for you then make it up!

Hope you guys like it!

**The Description**

You enter into a long hall about 30 feet across. To your right is the cave wall dotted by flickering torches that cast shadows from five statues placed incrementally along the path. The floor is made up of tiles about 10 feet by 10 feet, with the statues placed every other tile in the direct center. To your left is a chasm with no apparent bottom. As you walk onto the tiled area each statue glows a brilliant blue, then the color seems to concentrate on a certain area of the statue and forms a rune.

*Describe each statue as the players ask. The tiles serve no purpose except to make them think there might be pressure plates and for the final statue. The payoff (or trap aspect) of the puzzle comes to fruition in the next room, after the PCs have gone through the entire hall of statues. A successful ""disarm"" of the statue results in the rune flashing and fading. Walking past the statue without ""disarming"" it results in the statue flashing a brilliant red and the rune to turn red. The players will probably freak out at this point and wait for the bad thing to happen immediately, but the payoff comes later.* 

**The Puzzle**

*Everything on the statues is made of stone. The players kept asking if they could read the book or take the bow away.* 

Statue 1: The first statue you come across is of a robed figure extending a wand to his right. On his belt is a book with a glowing rune.

*Intended Solution: One of the PCs must cast any spell that would expend a spell slot on the statue*

*What my players did: Tried SO MANY CANTRIPS on various parts of the body and on the part of the ceiling. I made the statue flash each time a spell was cast but the rune stayed. Eventually my sorcerer used a sorcery point to cast twinned spell with a cantrip and I gave it to him.* 

Statue 2: The second statue is a grisly looking figure, well armored and holding a greatsword above his shoulder as though ready to swing it in a wide arc. Slightly to the left of center on his chest is a glowing rune.

*Intended Solution: One of the PCs must be injured. The extent of the injury does not matter, 1 HP or 100 HP makes no difference*

*What my players did: They stabbed the statue everywhere. So much so that they ended up injuring themselves, which met the requirement*

Statue 3: The third statue is a slightly crouched figure, shrouded in a cloak, his feet up on tip toe and his left hand wielding a dagger. There is a glowing rune on each of the heels of his feet.

*Intended Solution: Each PC must sneak past the statue DC13 (I want to reward them for understanding the puzzle but still have a decent chance of failure). It is possible for all of the PCs to fail this or for only a few, but only a maximum of two failures will count in the next chamber*

*What my players did: They decided to sneak up on the statue and mimic assassinating the statue, which in itself is more clever so I gave it to them.* 

The fourth statue is of a tall figure holding a bow, the string loose and the arm reaching back to a quiver to grab another arrow. His eyes are turned to the wall across the small chasm. On his quiver is a glowing rune.

*Intended Solution: A PC must make a ranged attack on the distant target that the statue is looking at. I don't put a DC restriction on it because my ranger has almost 100 arrows and I don't want him to roll a bunch of times since he can just repeat the action*

*What my players did: Pretty much exactly as described. I had my ranger roll a d4 to see how many arrows he expended trying to hit the target.* 

The fifth statue is a brawny figure with a large hammer in contact with the ground in front of him. On the hammer is a glowing rune.

*Intended Solution: Must place something of enough weight (20 lbs) on the tile that the hammer is contacting and LEAVE IT THERE. There will be an audible or visible depression in the tile once the weight is high enough*

*What my players did: I made sure that there was nothing particularly heavy nearby, but my ranger had the idea to climb down the chasm area and I let him find a nice heavy rock there. The bard and sorcerer had to hoist him up on the rope while he tried to not drop the rock.* 

**The Next Room, AKA the payoff**

A grand circular chamber greets your eyes (120 foot diameter). Another, larger statue stands tall in the center. In a circle, around the perimeter of the room, is each of the five runic symbols from the statues of the previous room. \[description of how many are glowing depends on how many statues they ""disarmed""\]

I wanted to make a easy-medium encounter for my three level 4 PCs if they had managed to disarm all the statues, so I gave them a stone golem with 80HP, AC 12, 1d6 + 2 bludgeoning, +4 to hit, and resistance to physical damage (the ranger is the one doing most of the damage in my game. If you have a majority of spellcasters I recommend making it resistant to magic damage).

As follows are the buffs gained by the Stone Guardian from each of the five statues. Whenever the buff is enacted the corresponding rune will flash. If you want a more lethal encounter then feel free to choose your own buffs.

Statue one buff: Stone Guardian Casts Stinking Cloud at the beginning of the fight as a surprise round (I chose stinking cloud because the statues would not be affected by the cloud)

Statue two buff: Stone Guardian multi-attacks every other turn

Statue three buff: \[# of failed sneak attempts, max 2\] smaller statues step out of the shadows and get sneak attacks on their first turn of combat (2d6 + 2). They die in one hit and lose their sneak attack after the first round, dealing only 1d6 + 2 for the remainder of combat.

Statue four buff: All attacks made from more than 30 feet away have disadvantage

Statue five buff: Stone Guardian casts slow on every PC whenever the DM feels it appropriate.

**What would I change?**

I was a little sad that none of the buffs ended up being used, though I believe that to be my fault in the puzzle design since the PCs had as much time as they wanted to progress past each statue with no consequence for failure. To make this puzzle better I would add some form of time constraint. Maybe gas is coming up from the chasm and they only have so many ""tries"" before the room is flooded and they need to proceed to the next area. Maybe something was chasing them and they don't have a lot of time to figure out how to get past before this thing catches up. Some form of incentive to pass by the statues is needed. 

Overall, there was no frustration when trying to solve the statues. I believe that in a higher pressure scenario they would have stumbled more and the following encounter with the Stone Guardian would have been much more epic, but because they were able to spend as much time as they wanted in the puzzle area they kind of breezed through that one.

[GENTLE REPOSE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gentle-repose)

* Clerics, Wizards and Druids are often tasked with caring for the dead, not only to prevent the spread of infectious disease, but to prevent said corpses from becoming dangerous undead creatures that may wreak havoc in small towns where latent, necromantic curses may linger. The Ritual of Gentle Repose is the bread-and-butter of all these efforts.
* Such clerics, druids and wizards may often find a living caring for the dead, utilizing this ritual in temples, gravehouses, as well as in other more municipal capacities in larger cities. The ability to do so has prevented the outbreak of many mundane diseases, makes death ceremonies far more pleasing (as bodies tend not to decay until they're interred), and even raises the prospect for some to maintain the bodies of their dead until they can afford to have them brought back to life.
* This latter potential is often reserved for those who can pay for it, unfortunately, though some druidic circles and less-known clerical orders may provide these services of resurrection by other means of payment.
* ***Story Tags: Professions (Mortician), Health &amp; Well-being***

[HEAT METAL](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gentle-repose)

* The ability to magically heat metal instantly to a red-hot state has an impact on professions as well as in the use and types of arms &amp; armor available.
* Professionally, blacksmiths who are able to utilize this spell can find a means to craft certain items more quickly. Some of the most renown smiths are said to have had furnaces with such magic imbued in them, so that metal would be instantly heated to a red-hot and malleable state, regardless of its density.
* Overall demand for leather and dense cloth armors has necessarily increased due to the use of this spell, and other spells which take advantage of the conductive properties of metal.
* The spell has also increased demand for quick-don heavy armor, the metal of which is particularly susceptible to this spell. In the event one's armor is heated, plates can more easily be removed as needed. Since it's often more expensive and niche-use, this type of armor is generally higher-demand for mercenaries, bounty hunters, and body guards of important individuals.
* ***Story Tags: Artisanship, Military, Armor***

[LEVITATE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/levitate)

* An enhancement on the *Floating Disc, Levitate* is a revolutionary spell which allows a minor form of flight for objects as well as creatures.
* In labor and industry, Levitate can be used to lift payloads far more easily to the tops of buildings with the help of ropes and pulleys, in loading/unloading large cargo, or used on craftsfolk or laborers to get to hard-to-reach areas.
* Criminals and explorers are especially fond of Levitation as well, as it allows them often to avoid security measures and prying eyes.
* It may also augment an explorer's repertoire, allowing them to avoid traps, or to read cryptic runes high up in a ruin.
* See: *Spider Climb* for similar storytelling impacts!
* ***Story Tags: Labor and Industry, Break-ins, Exploration***

[LOCATE ANIMALS OR PLANTS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-animals-or-plants)

* This ritual spell allows many bards, druids and rangers to make a living collecting plants and hunting creatures for their meat, pelts, or domestication
* With a little familiarity and knowledge of plant life and surrounding natural elements, even the most rare herbs can be located far more quickly than they would otherwise.
* The spell also allows hunters to hone in on their prey more easily.
* In places with competing hunters and gatherers using this spell, quite a bit of competition may exist to reach rare plants or animals when they appear within range of the spell (5 miles). Accordingly, hunters/gatherers may be paid to wander certain areas, continually looking for specific creatures or plants and collecting them before others do.
* Interestingly, some plants and creatures have evolved the ability to mask their signatures from this divinatory spell, and are highly-prized not only for their rare components, but for arcane research as well.
* ***Story Tags: Economy, Professions (Hunting &amp; Gathering)***

[LOCATE OBJECT](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-object)

* This spell provides for yet another magical profession, that of the Locater or ""Seeker"".  These professionals can come and locate whatever you lost in your house, business or otherwise, with relative ease.
* One caveat of the spell is that the object must be known to the caster, requiring that they have been within 30 feet of it at least once. To get around this, skilled Locaters will utilize the Detect Thoughts spell to familiarize themselves with a specific object they need to find, as they may (with or without consent) project themselves into the querent's memory. With any luck, this allows them to utilize the Locate Object ritual to its fullest extents.
* If unable to provide a direct description or recall of an object, Locaters may instead attempt to locate similar types of objects. This often takes more time, though again, skilled locaters have means to narrow this search down considerably.
* Investigators, Bounty Hunters, Security professionals, and Assassins may also find this spell useful to their areas of expertise.
* Objects can easily be shielded from this spell by being placed in containers lined with lead. This further increases the demand for lead itself, as its properties of obfuscation are helpful in protecting from a variety of magical scrying methods.
* ***Story Tags: Professions (Locator), Divination, Investigation, Law Enforcement***

[MAGIC MOUTH](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth)

* These magical PA systems are quite common around the realms, as they may be cast as a ritual, and persist until dispelled.
* Often used with complex triggers, such as speaking a specific password or ringing a specific tone of a bell, in order to provide a message. In conjunction with Illusory Script and cryptography, can be used to create elaborate hidden messaging systems.
* Magic Mouths have quite a bit of utility value. This serves as yet another spell that allows some mages to make a great living from casting it (costs a minimum of 10 GP per casting), often paired with setting up security, *continual flames, alarms,* and the like.
* In places that can afford it, chains of magic mouths can be setup to deliver a message from one place to another. Due to the cost of the ritual spell, however, this is often limited to powerful Mage guilds.
* Also commonly used by the military, hidden societies, guilds, and political groups.
* ***Story Tags: Professions (""Person who adds cool magic stuff to your house""), Security, Communication***

[PASS WITHOUT TRACE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace)

* Bane of many investigators the world over, Pass without Trace enables a group to obscure themselves from all but the most honed or magical eyes.
* Popularized in Elven militaries in conjunction with their innate darkvision and a skilled Obfuscator, groups such as the Felshadow were able to eviscerate entire legions of human and dragonborn adversaries with a relative few shock-troops. It's historically also enabled the infiltration of highly secured castles and other fortifications, and the assassination of important political and military leaders.
* To combat this, societies and militaries have evolved to strengthen their magical security measures mostly through the liberal use of Alarm rituals. Detect Magic, Detect Thoughts, and Enhance Ability have also been utilized to increase awareness of hidden enemies.
* This spell alone has given druids and rangers (usually Elven) a bad reputation in some places that suffered due to its military application.
* Some legendary thieves have been able to utilize the spells ability to leave no trace of their passing to go on thorough stealing-sprees, to the chagrin of the investigators attempting to ferret them out. Elaborate traps are needed to capture such thieves preemptively, as once they've come and gone, there's often no way to find their escape route.
* ***Story Tags: Military, Infiltration, Spies, Arms Race, Break-Ins***

[PROTECTION FROM POISON](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-poison)

* Often overlooked by adventuring types, Protection from Poison is a must-have for political, diplomatic and guild figures who are often the target of assassination attempts via poisoning.
* As a matter of course, most kings, queens and lordly-types have their court guardians cast this spell on them before any meal, particularly if guests and dignitaries are present.
* Due to this, Assassins often go to extra lengths to secure substances with properties other than poisoning to bypass the spells protections, such as those which induce necrosis. However, these are highly-illegal to possess or cultivate, and usually only enter the hands of the most highly skilled and dangerous killers who themselves likely have a price on their heads already.
* The search for such magical toxins creates demand for monster-hunters, explorers and the like, to provide these rare and deadly substances.
* ***Story Tags: Anti-Assassination, Security, Health, Arms Race, Professions (Hunter / Gatherer)***

[PYROTECHNICS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pyrotechnics)

* While some royal houses will employ powerful Bards and Wizards to cast this spell for their personal entertainment, it's also a go-to nonviolent tool for spellcasting law enforcers.
* It may be used in a similar manner as Color Spray to blind a group of people, which makes them easier to apprehend. The spell also has some adaptability in that it can create large clouds of smoke. Guards with augmented vision may then enter an obscured area and apprehend those within the area of effect. Smoke clouds may also serve as a general method to disperse a crowd, as it's generally unpleasant to remain in the area.
* ***Story Tags: Law Enforcement, Entertainment***

[ROPE TRICK](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/rope-trick)

* A favorite spell of thieves, fugitives, and wary wizards, Rope Trick serves as a relatively low-cost spell for providing a temporary hiding space away from mundane eyes.
* A lesser form of Leomund's Tiny Hut, the spell lasts only an hour and also requires climbing up a rope, up to 60 feet, but usually shorter to make access a bit easier.
* Thieves are particularly fond of setting up a Rope Trick in alleyways near their marks as an excellent escape from pursuers.
* As with many other spells, Rope Tricks have created more demand for Aurans/Diviners on town guard teams so that their invisible entryways can still be spotted. Guards may then be placed below, and simply wait until the thief is forced to climb down, when the pursuit may continue.
* Low-level wizards utilize the spell as their first magical hide-aways. Though the extradimensional space provided only lasts an hour, the ability to disconnect completely from any outside distraction even for a short time can be vital to their studies.
* ***Story Tags: Profession (Auran Guard), Escape, Break-Ins, Wizard Stuff***

[SEE INVISIBILITY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility)

* An important spell for Aurans (aka Seers, Diviners), this allows them to see incoming invisible creatures, but more importantly gives them Sight Beyond Sight with the ability to see into the Ethereal Plane itself.
* Also known as ""Minor Seeing"", this is a primary means of perceiving directly into a realm beyond the physical plane into the Border Ethereal, and sometimes beyond. This allows Seers to perceive spirits residing in certain locations, which grants them a sense of added history to the places they visit, and often enough, the ability to communicate with such spirits directly.
* Additionally, in the event that planar rifts or portals are present, Seers utilizing this spell may be able to tell what dimensions may be bleeding through, as the unique imprint from those dimensions is usually left in the ether in the form of arcane vapors of varying colors.
* ***Story Tags: Profession (Aurans), Security, Communication, Ghost Stuff***

[SILENCE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence)

* Silence is a vital ritual enchantment for anti-magic security measures, as it negates verbal components required for a majority of spells.
* Since it has a duration of 10 minutes, the ritual must be repeatedly created in order to persist. As such, it requires advanced artificing to accomplish a more permanent enchantment, and is limited to important locations where magic must be prohibited, such as chambers of law, throne rooms, or diplomatic meeting areas. In rare cases, explorers have found hidden temple chambers imbued with the Silence spell.
* Silence is also an important law-enforcement tool in apprehending criminal spellcasters, as it often renders them helpless to use their magic.
* ***Story Tags: Security, Law Enforcement, Building Enchantments***

[SKYWRITE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/skywrite)

* Important ritual in some druidic and arcane orders to communicate basic messages across large distances, as with Animal Messenger.
* Used in situations where Animal Messengers are not available, or may be intercepted.
* Since everyone present may see the message, such druidic and arcane orders often develop their own cryptic symbols so that only the intended recipients can understand what's being written in the clouds. This also allows them to embed more information in a single word, and with repeat castings of the ritual, a great deal may be communicated with a few clouds meandering off into the sky.
* ***Story Tags: Communication, Military***

[SPIDER CLIMB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spider-climb)

* Another favorite for ne'r-do-wells, Spider Climb allows burglars and assassins to walk on walls and ceilings with ease, enabling them to avoid ground patrols and many basic security measures with ease.
* To counter this, particularly paranoid folk have even been known to grease or otherwise trap their own chamber ceilings.
* Rangers and explorers are also particularly fond of this spell, as they're able to traverse down sheer cliffs, into seemingly bottomless pits, or scale immense pillars or walls of ancient ruins to get unique and sometimes vital viewpoints. In fact, archeological expeditions that forget to at least bring a few scrolls of Spider Climb are often shrugged off as futile efforts.
* In towns and cities, Spider Climb is also used in labor and industry to assist in construction, in recovering difficult to reach objects, and by town guards to setup unique patrol routes along rooftops and even on the sides of castle walls, some of which are made with unique crenelations to help utilize the spell to maximum effectiveness for defense.
* ***Story Tags: Break-Ins, Security, Exploration, Labor and Industry, Military, Defense***

[SUGGESTION](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion)

* Mages sometimes ruminate on the ever-present ""War of Suggestion"" being waged in every village, town and city throughout the many kingdoms of the multiverse. Guardsfolk find themselves miles away from their patrol routes, Nobles are convinced to mangle their own political alliances by seemingly-reasonable gestures at the most inopportune moments, and even the most powerful thieves in the land are brought low, having been suggested that the local magistrate wished to speak with them over a cup of tea.
* Due to the wide-ranging and creative uses of the spell Suggestion (not to mention a variety of other manipulative spells), Bards, Wizards and charismatic spellcasters are all often considered with a great deal of suspicion, and accordingly, have to work much harder to gain trust, not only of those in positions of power, but even some common folk who have something to lose.
* Since those of Elven heritage are not as susceptible to the effects of such magical suggestions (and other charm effects), the loyalty of elves is often coveted and even required when it comes to politics, diplomacy, and law-enforcement. While they may fall prey to charms on occasion, they're also far more aware, in general, of this form of magic, and are likely to be able to warn their companions of its potential use.
* ***Story Tags: Charlatans, Arms Race, Elves, Politics and Diplomacy***

[ZONE OF TRUTH](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/zone-of-truth)

* The judicial and political applications of Zone of Truth are ubiquitous and paramount in a magical world!
* In official proceedings, it's usually required that a Zone of Truth be cast by a court-approved Bard, Cleric or Paladin, who may serve alongside a judge, or, most often, serve as a judge themselves.
* Those who resist Zones of Truth in official proceedings are often held in contempt of court until such a time as they agree to abide by its magic. Judges or Adjudicators are always able to tell if someone is resisting the truth!
* While the proper use of this spell has been known to increase justice for all, a corrupt judge or adjudicator is capable of ruining the lives of many. These corrupt judges may be able to decide important political or diplomatic affairs unilaterally as well, since they may simply insist that someone is lying under their zone of truth, while they in fact are not.
* Some realms which place a higher value on personal freedom establish restraints when it comes to Zone of Truth, as it has been known to be abused by those in power. Additionally, judges may also be required to pass occasional Truth tests themselves to ensure that they have not been abusing their own divinatory powers.
* Thief guilds, military tribunals, even pirates have been known to utilize Zones of Truth for the purposes of rooting out moles and traitors in their ranks.
* Accordingly, in all sections of society, the lives of folk who utilize magical Truth are sometimes compelled to spend their entire lives adjudicating, both formally in court, and informally, on the streets and in their own lives.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,50,273,"Recently, I started a new campaign, and as I was trying to decide the best way to bring the party together, I realized how much I hate the boring, cliche ""oh, y'all were at a parade, and a monster attacked, and in the confusion, you 4-6 were the only ones to stand and fight. Guess you're an adventuring party now!"" or, even worse, ""you all are in a tavern when an NPC comes in &amp; says ""I need strong steel and quick charms to do XYZ quest."" These both smacked of DM fiat and felt like I would be setting my table up to expect the DM to give 90-100% of the content, which I very much wanted (and still want) to avoid for this campaign.

So, I was left with the following problem: ""**How do I start a campaign in a way that feels organic, but still gets the players to go where I want them to go?**""

&amp;#x200B;

A ~~small~~ large amount of background is in order, so that I can adequately explain how and why my approach worked, and continues to work after multiple sessions, and then demonstrate how to apply it in your game(s).

**TL;DR** at the bottom, and **headings** to help navigate for specific questions/information

# Setting up for Success:

Before Session 0, I sent out an 11 page PDF with information about the world, a few hints &amp; bits of information about the campaign itself, and descriptions of the races that were present in the setting. All of this information was framed as excerpts from different books, treatises, and songs/rhymes that exist in my world. This layer of immersion had a few side benefits, including helping those players who had never played with me, or at all, get a feel for how my writing style works; providing NPC names that I could reference later in the campaign, and the players would vaguely recognize them as informed experts in the field; and finally, allowing me to info-dump in a slightly more creative way. I do highly recommend taking the time to write these in character!

When the players got to Session 0, they were asked to bring Character Concepts, which I explained as ""the elevator pitch/30 second description of your character, a vague outline of their backstory, and an approximation of age &amp; place of birth"". These Concepts were approved or modified in Session 0, mostly in private between the player and the DM; that is just my personal style, not necessarily something I can recommend either way. Once the Character Concepts got approved, I sent information about place of birth &amp; general world-building information to each player, as appropriate, and asked them to write up their actual backstories.

I had varying levels of success amongst the players at my table; I don't say this to poke fun at anybody, but merely to provide an honest accounting of the events as they occurred, so that you all can have as much information as I can provide. I had informed the players that our mutual goal was to end up with Characters that felt as though they had lived in the world before the start of the adventure, and so there were only a couple of complaints and questions of whether these standards were necessary. After a couple weeks, I wound up with a table of 5 Players, each of whom had created a Player Character that had a 2-4 page backstory, which referenced both specific NPCs and unspecified NPC archetypes, place names from around the campaign world, events from their childhood and early adult years, even a few sets of parents' names.

**N.B.** I did ask that the players all familiarize themselves with [Knife Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/) to create characters.

&amp;#x200B;

# Planning the Intro

Once I had characters that were suitably rich in detail, and had taken the time to weave those backstory events into the history of the world, I was in a position to start mapping out the Intro arc, and more specifically, the first session, of the campaign. The game was going to be a decidedly sandbox format, because I was super excited to see what the 6 of us (5 players and the DM) could come up with. Due to the sandbox nature of the campaign, I did not want to have railroading, even in the most minor of forms, present in that first session. This eliminated most, if not all, of the common methods of starting a campaign, since all of them revolve around the DM telling you ""your characters are present to witness an event, and you don't actually have much of a choice, except to follow along, because otherwise how would the game progress?"" While this really isn't an issue at all, and in most circumstances would be overlooked or forgotten by the end of the first session, I was determined not to have that be the first D&amp;D experience of the campaign.

My solution was simple: Ask that each player, who by this point knew their characters quite well, to give me the reason their PC had come to the port city of Graekas, the starting location of the campaign. In my request, I had included a brief blurb about Graekas, again framed as an In-Universe writing. To summarize, Graekas is a port city on the northern edge of a cluster of islands, and serves as a hub of traffic for people from around the world.

Now, armed with 5 unique reasons for the 5 characters to be in the same location at the same time, I was ready; I sent a message to the player who had given me their backstory the earliest, and asked if he would be okay with having received a letter from an NPC in his backstory, and letting that be the initial plot hook. He, being a team player, agreed, and my plan came together.

&amp;#x200B;

# The First Session

Via PDF, the character, Gregory, received a letter from a former employer of his, Mr. Isaac; in this letter, Isaac asked that Gregory check in on something for him, because Isaac knew Gregory was much closer and much more able to deal with whatever this problem might be than he was. It was a logical, if slightly vague, request. Thus, the first session began as follows:

&gt;The United Confederacy of Islands is a new player on the world stage. What previously would have been a cluster of city-states and small settlements banded together out of a shared desire for freedom from the aggressive expansion of the mainland empires. This was accomplished by an unprecedented pooling of resources from an amalgamation of races and cultures. The Dwarves and Gnomes of Maellas, Humans living in towns and cities made up of people from a variety of different nations on the Mainland, and the reclusive Elves of Katoikia, who walk the world in ones and twos, if at all, each brought something to the table….  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaukola, an island previously pockmarked by towns and villages of a few hundred people each, rapidly expanded into a metropolis that covers the entire island. Graekas, an island with diverse peoples from dozens of backgrounds, codified the borders of the city-states, tribal lands, and the Kingdom of Maellas, allowing for prosperity. Elven magics facilitated much of this, enabling infrastructure and population densities unheard of anywhere in the known world; strangely, nobody seems to understand specifically what the Elves got out of the deal, as their only talking point during negotiations was that they be allowed to continue their isolationist ways.  
&gt;  
&gt;This brings us to today, a bright and crisp morning in the port city of Graekas, Gateway to the Islands. Despite growing up in different places across the UCI and beyond, you all have come to Graekas seeking one thing or another, as have thousands of other people over the last decade or so. As most travelers do, upon reaching town you found a tavern and inn and rented rooms. In Graekas, there is one ""inn"" who's reputation has spread far beyond the outskirts of the city: The Busty Angel. Known for exceptional quality in a *wide* variety of services, the prices are also exceptionally high. Thus, the second most prosperous tavern in town receives the majority of its clientele.  
&gt;  
&gt;Having come down into the main room of the Longing Tap, the bustling and much more reasonably priced tavern that houses all but the absurdly wealthy travelers, sitting at various tables are each of you, except for:  
&gt;  
&gt;&lt;to George&gt; you. You burst through the front door and are momentarily caught off guard by the sudden warmth given off by the roaring fireplace on the wall opposite the bar. Your eyes adjust to the new light, and you see a number of patrons have turned to look at this stranger framed in the doorway.  
&gt;  
&gt;&lt;gruff voice&gt; ""Shut the damn door, you're letting in the cold."" The bartender calls out to you. An average sized Dwarf, with red, bushy beard and hair, he gestures to the still open front door behind you.  
&gt;  
&gt;&lt;\[Player Name Redacted\] describe your PC&gt;

This led to some of the most spontaneous roleplaying I had seen to date. I unfortunately don't have a transcript of the following 30mins of gameplay, but it consisted of Gregory asking the bartender for his opinion on which patrons might be looking to for work as hired muscle on a short term job, and then moving around the room and interacting, one by one, with 7 different people. You'll note that throughout this post, I have referred, repeatedly, to the fact that there are 5 players at the table. The gave brief descriptions of 4 people, 1 of whom was an NPC, and 3 of whom were 3 of the other 4 PCs. Gregory, without the possibility of any meta knowledge on the part of his player, was making genuine introductions to both PCs and NPCs alike, looking for anybody who would help him.

The interactions went something like this:

1. (With a slim, well dressed figure dining alone in a dark corner of the tavern)Gregory: ""Hi, do you have a moment?""Urion (another PC): ""F\*ck off!""Gregory: (Coming back with 2 drinks) ""I could really use your help with -""Urion: ""Go bother somebody else.""
2. (Approaching a hulking brute of a man)Gregory: ""Can I buy you a drink and offer a job?""NPC: ""No. Just let me drink in peace.""
3. (With a slight, child-sized, figure)Gregory: ""Offer you a job?""Hasar (PC): ""If it pays, I'm listening.""&lt;negotiations &amp; discussions&gt;
4. Another player asked if they could jump in, I said yesTierl (Folk-Hero PC) ""I heard you asking for help, can I offer my services?""

And so on for between 25 and 40 minutes. I had given a plot hook, and while I'm sure the players all knew that I expected/would like for their PCs to pursue this, their characters had to organically &amp; **in character** convince each other to help. All 6 of us agreed that it was a very natural way to explain why the group was working together.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Aftermath, &amp; My Conclusion(s)

While this took significantly more effort to set up and execute than using one of the tried and true methods of starting a campaign, I feel that the benefits far outweighed that effort. First, the sandbox feel of the game was immediately present, from timestamp 0:00 of the campaign; a lot of DMs tell their party ""You're free to do whatever you'd like"", but this method shows that. Second, the party has a precedent of quest hooks being given by each other, and doing favors for each other. This has been recurring throughout the game so far, and has allowed a much greater sense of immersion in the world, and investment in the game. Finally, by having the characters' interactions all framed by the fact that they are doing favors for each other, bringing in backstory material is unbelievably easy, and often done at the player's whim, as opposed to that of the DM.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been several sessions now, and we've wrapped up a few different plot arcs and quests, and I've found that this method of starting the campaign has made the typically arduous task of preparing for sessions in a sandbox game much less daunting. I'll share the prep work schemata that I used most recently, to prepare for a ""hub session"" in which the players had 6 or 7 different directions open to them.

&gt;Downtime!  
&gt;  
&gt;\- 1 afternoon's worth; players expected to resolve a few shopping lists  
&gt;  
&gt;Rumors Heard during Downtime:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- 2 per PC, based on Race, Background, Class as appropriate

I also prepped a couple of battle maps, because one of the options involved a potential multi-stage combat encounter. Everything else I needed for the session had already been written by the players in their PC Backstories, or in the World Building I did months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Give players strict guidelines for creating their characters, so that you can tie their backstories into the game setting. For Session 1, give a PC the initial plot hook, so that the party drives the narrative themselves, not the DM.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,89,1738,"So i'm sure everyone here already knows about [this](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator) fantastic site for generating maps.

What I haven't seen discussed is that upon exporting as an SVG file, you can import it into your choice of SVG editor to get full control over building placement, size, road layout, and everything you could ever want - I use Adobe Illustrator but [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a great free alternative! 

I'm currently using a map I generated as the basis for a completely urban campaign. For this I wanted the entire campaign, beginning to end, to take place in one large, smoky, London-esque city, with the players running a detective agency and solving mysteries. There are some absolutely terrific guides to urban campaign planning and writing compelling mysteries on here so I won't repeat what they've said.

I used [this](https://imgur.com/X6X0FPr) as my starting point.

Now thats a lot to deal with, so I focused on the tight-knit slum area on the north-east side of the map, as it seemed an interesting place to start a low level campaign; all knotted streets and shady alleys. 

Selecting all the buildings from that area, then copy&gt;pasting into a new document, enlarging, adding some street names, I ended up with [this](https://imgur.com/SBSshbJ).

This was enough for me to run a one shot, and I used the story beats that developed from that session to start highlighting places of interest (the Orange buildings). With this much fine control, I began to consider the possibilities that this amount of editing would allow for, and very quickly found myself going down a rabbit hole, expanding the map into individual districts, Names for every street, alley and nook, colour coded buildings denoting gang territories... The possibilities are endless. Here are some [examples](https://imgur.com/a/OK0RNa9).

The final product will be a printed handout for my players that will allow them to navigate the city and refer to parts of it with ease, really cementing the idea that their characters have lived here their whole lives, and know their way around like the back of their hand/paw/tentacle. There's still a ton of stuff to flesh out, but on the whole it's made the whole planning phase much more engaging. I'v found that even something as simple as a randomly generated series of squares, when seen shady, dead-end alleys or crooked crossroads, can be incredibly inspiring.

I hope that this helps some of you to get as lost in the map making process as I have. Please send help, I haven't seen the sun for days.",1,PSA - Medieval Town Generator maps are fully editable in Adobe Illustrator - A goldmine for Urban Campaigns.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,70,"**Confession // WARNING // Before i Begin**

I, *Dracomortua*, spent years working in homeless shelters, foster parenting, outreach, support for disabled and finally gave five years trying to save so-called *youth at risk*. Most of my kids went 'for rent' on street corners (to get more drugs) &amp;/or died from [fentanyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl) overdose. Often both. This changed my views a bit. If you find this writeup does NOT fit your game, don't let that get you down! My twisted view of both humanity and society need not be yours. In fact, if you are happy living in your *Middle Class Bubble*, this is just not for you. Have a hug! You are worthy of love. Don't do drugs. Resist mind control! But upvote this posting, okay? Trust me on this.

**The High Price of Fantasy**

In D&amp;D casters are seen as *healers, AoE damage, mob control &amp; occasional 'Damage Per Second' oriented backup* ('DPS'). They can even do 'flavour &amp;/or fluff', such as entertainment (*'yay, bards get room &amp; board free, woopie, i are luck'*) or other such downtime silliness. Does this make sense though? From what we know of our contemporary society: once food and shelter are secured humans pay most absurdly for luxury not-goods. If we know anything about [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.ca) we know people will gladly blow a [vacation worth of money](https://www.quora.com/What-could-you-do-with-all-the-money-you-spend-at-Starbucks-in-a-year) just not to feel a bit less crappy 99% of the time.

If we know anything about people, we know that they would do [anything to avoid themselves](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19682-all-of-humanity-s-problems-stem-from-man-s-inability-to-sit). So what would illusions and charms *really* be used for?

Assuming human nature, let us re-list / review a number of spells as listed in the Rules as Written (RAW). The spell uses below outline how mages (&amp; bards) in your world could level up, gain power and take over the power behind the throne *without even trying*. This is how they would defeat enemies, ruin allies and utterly break gods on many levels - and then bill for their fine service.


**Enchantment Spells as Psychotropic Drugs**

- *Friends* - This spell is often called *Enemies* for its long lasting reverse effect. Warlocks make a healthy profit doing both *social &amp;/or political character assassinations*. Warlocks disguise themselves as the person that is to be character-assassinated (with makeup, *Disguise Self* &amp;/or both) and spell-target any pseudo-influential people (whilst smiling at them). Also: one can also use this spell to get over heartbreak: your hired witch or warlock puts on the visage of your ex-loved-one and then casts this *Enemies* spell on you: boom, off the hook. Congratulations, you now you hate your ex. No more problems with [Spotless Minds](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/).

- *Charm Person* - This spell is hard to put on the market except in [potion format](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102343/). With range of 'self' it must be used by the caster (or their *surprisingly charming familiar*, perhaps?). It is the annoying kid brother of *Suggestion* in this regard. Hard to make solid use of this spell unless one is a specialist Wizard-*Enchanter*. Even harder to market.

- *Command* - Back in the day we had a lot of fun with some verbs. Other than silly and goofy combat uses, very little market value. Occasionally used by entry-level bards on stage shows that feature 'guest' audience members making fools of themselves.

- *Heroism:* - Interesting that this is exclusively an enchantment. For the duration of this spell one *feels completely like a hero*, so much so that one can act the part very effectively. Granted this 'high' is no more than a minute (!), but this offers no withdrawal. This one can turn a profit, especially among washed up champions and over the hill gladiators missing their [glory days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vQpW9XRiyM).

- *Sleep* - No saving throw. Any 'variant' human w/ *Magic Initiate* feat can provide instant relief every night. Not a bad career option here. No more messing with those unpredictable Drow poisons.

- *Tasha's Hideous Laughter* - Once again, only for a minute. Still, that is one heck of a good joke and surprisingly valuable [health benefits](https://www.gaiam.com/blogs/discover/7-health-benefits-of-laughter). Note that [ex-Laduguer cultists](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Laduguer) may well appreciate this stuff. 

- *Calm Emotions* - Possibly of some use for [riot control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control). Also useful for troops fighting fear-generating foes, such as dragons. Beats a pep talk from the general.

- *Suggestion* - What we know of [placebo](https://www.drugs.com/article/placebo-effect.html), this spell is pure gold / print your own money. People would request *suggestions* for: increase of confidence, feel amazing, see things differently, focus on any task for eight hours, speak well of someone without sarcasm or irony, feel that love again... whatever you like... with NO SIDE EFFECTS! 

- *Zone of Truth* Many medieval communities accepted [trial by combat[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_combat) as a means to officiate innocence. No more! *This spell would change the shape of entire legal &amp; justice systems overnight*. Extra note: confessions made in an active *Zone of Truth* beat any *Quest* spell. Notes: save every round or tell the truth for (remaining) ten minutes. Does not work [on the dead](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/01/24/does-zone-of-truth-work-in-combination-with-speak-with-dead/)

- *Mass Suggestion* This spell is a *must have* for hag covens. All the power of *Suggestion* (above) / NO concentration required. Give participants eight hours minimum of pure bliss, focus, concentration, confidence, sexual prowess or whatever mental boost they need. Imagine what a caster could charge for the ten day, thirty day or that 'year &amp; a day' version! Student: ""I want to be an amazing and devoted student this year!"" Hag: ""'You are an amazing and devoted student - with no doubts or depression about your chosen major.' Done. That will be one thousand gold, please. See you next year.' 

**Illusion As Ultimate Hallucinogens**

*Note: What is a D&amp;D illusion?* - This is a [deeply complex debate](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/101623/are-illusions-just-mind-tricks-or-do-they-produce-physical-images-and-sounds?rq=1) as to the nature of D&amp;D illusions. Are they real lights and sounds or mere tricks of the mind? Your call. This post assumes targets can [fail their saving throw](https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/708009718757720064) / enjoy their show.

- *Minor Illusion* - Not so much for pleasure other than an amazing puppet show set. Fantastic for developing a [maquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquette) for nearly any professional project. Not just for sculptors and [architects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ffj8SHrbk0): also great for engineering, design and urban planning. Sounds, especially those done via *Keen Mind* or *Mindreading* can replicate voices from the departed lost to the mists of time - i.e. [they are dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIrBMt4eiRk).

- *Silent Image* - Enjoy a weird version of [Blade Runner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WPta4nioIU) romance. Also bigger. Very useful for ten minutes of education.

- *Phantasmal Force* - This would be *the ultimate fantasy spell*, except for the fact it lasts for one whole entire bloody minute. Customers using this for pleasure must get their fantasy on FAST... or have many, many castings. Upside: saving throw only kicks in on 'investigation', i.e. target not forced a RAW saving throw / can enjoy without problem.

- *Fear* - Some people like horror. I don't judge. 

- *Major Image* - This spell has a permanent form cast at 6th lvl. It also specifies the caster can move the image however they like. Can a caster set the image for a complex sequence of actions and positions? Does that overlap with *Programmed Illusion*? Unlike *Phantasmal Force*, this spell has no hallucinatory substance and is essentially a hologram. Even more bizarre, if you 'disbelieve' the sounds you cannot hear them anymore. ""This music is amazing! Wait, are those [Klipsch](https://www.klipsch.ca) dance hall speakers? Wow... i don't believe it! Aw, bummer.""

- *Creation* - This is a 5' cube that lasts for a day. That is a lot of high quality booze, hooch, shrooms or whatever you like. Note: you can kill yourself on two grains of [carfentanil](https://www.nhpr.org/post/nh-overdose-deaths-expected-decline-year-not-much#stream/0). ""The orc army is happy! No wait... they are suddenly asleep. At least they look asleep? Oh gads, call 911 stat!! We will need a truckload of [Naloxone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone)....""

- *Dream* - This [write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/amv5bt/dream_a_little_dream_exploring_one_of_the_most/) written by u/wandering-monster - and they did an amazing job at that. No spoilers. From what i have seen of chronic drug users, this spell would single-handedly dominate entire kingdoms on its own.

- *Mirage Arcane* - Want to go to Disneyland® or Disneyworld®? This spell can make rollercoasters (and any other structure) up to one mile square. Ten minutes to cast, last ten days. Downside: no creatures, just structures. Upside: this spell can do amazing gravity effects (RAW). Note: ANY structure. Can the [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerbread_house) created there sustain life? What happens if such a person eats the local structures and then leaves after ten days?  

- *Simulacrum* If you can find a way to get clippings (hair or nails) from your hottest superstar, you get their duplicate as a willing slave for life. Such a golem would not age and would 'not develop or progress' - so this thing would have utterly no memory of what uses / abuses you have done. You suffer from 'ethics'? No problem: you are technically playing with a block of snow. Note: expensive repairs, batteries not included.

**Honourable Mention:**

- *True Polymorph* - Create anything you want for an hour. It can be made 'permanent' if you like. This can produce [a lot](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/64580/how-large-can-a-thing-be-produced-by-true-polymorph) of traditional, non-magical drugs. Fortunately this spell is hard to get / 9th level as it is a game-breaker. This spell is the cause of many [complex debates](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/75752/how-do-multiple-castings-of-true-polymorph-interact). Can you make a [specific person](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/64578/can-you-permanently-true-polymorph-into-yourself?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1)? No one knows, it is 5e. It can produce lots of beer, coffee, tobacco, wine or shrooms though.

- *Lesser Restoration* - This spell cures disease, right? Does that include PTSD, ADHD, OCD or any of the other forms of [abnormal psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_psychology)? Is [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress-related_disorders) a disease? How bout neuroticism of any kind? Paranoia? Would great world leaders not be paying wicked cash for this? Anyway, this spell could revolutionize the magical-psychological world.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,54,"Snake Trains take you from point A to point B. They exist in your world for those times where you party wants to go somewhere and you have no idea what's in between where they are, and this new place. They're big snakes. And trains. Kinda like the catbus from Totoro but moody.

The first issue is a free, 8-page supplement detailing 5 passengers on the train, what the train actually does, and the first stop on this new journey your party is taking. 

So here it is, [SNAKE TRAIN ISSUE 1](https://johnbattle.itch.io/snake-train-1).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

WHO
---
These are the fellow guests on the snake train. 

**Xxzylo**

* Says they'll pay you for souls.
* Doesn't Say that they aren't always as happy as they appear
* Actively Hides their self hate and jealousy

They are a demon and a very open one at that. They exchange souls for gold, paying 10gp per HD of the creature/person. They have points of true depression and bouts of euphoria, both of which exhaust them. They are on the train to gather souls and become strong enough to overcome what they call ""faulty wiring"".

**Slade**

* Says they are a simple knight looking for absolution
* Doesn't Say that they are melancholic and lackadaisical
* Actively Hides that they are a death knight older than all others

Marvelous armor of black gold, large hands gripping the limbs and strangling the neck, sculpted in photo-realism. Slade is a breathing myth with connections and relations to all powerful entities. He's on the train to find a final resting place because he's just so sick of being undead.

**Goner the Half-Elf**

* Says she's cold and stoic
* Doesn't Say that she was raised to be silent
* Actively Hides her love for joyous music

Goner left the Moon at a young age and never looked back. She was raised by a family that never understood her and treated her as an obedient lap dog, doting on their every whim and punishing her whenever she showed any semblance of a personality. She's on the train to escape the Moon police.

**Eric the Kobold**

* Says that they are a relic of chaos
* Doesn't Say that they plot and scheme every move they make
* Actively Hides the deck of many things they keep hidden on their person

Eric is neither a Kobold or their proper name. A shapeshifter of many forms, often changing to ones that are meant to cause discomfort and unease. They are a beauty and splintered conversationalist. After witnessing the personal ruin that comes from chaos, they tempt others as an agent of brash moves and unthinking responses.

**Princess Harroway**

* Says that she shouldn't waste her time with you
* Doesn't Say that she is just horribly anxious
* Actively Hides that her father committed horrible war crimes that probably affected someone at the table's backstory

The Harroway family are legends among the political scene and gossip among the same crowds for their lack of an heir. Princess Harroway is adopted and is traveling to find her birth mother. The problem is, she doesn't know where to start looking. All she has is an drawing of an unidentifiable bird

---------------------------------------
What
---

Snake Trains are a form of transportation. And reptile. Big, slithering bois, with magically hollow backs shaped like a modern bus. Stretchy, cold-scaled windows. Elastic door that closes tight while in motion. Children of the world snake perhaps? They're sworn to secrecy, so even the snake-charmers of the world haven't been able to get more than a date from these mysterious vehicles.

**The Snake Train**

**Talks** in slow, low voice. Imagine a bear at the back of a deep cave, talking low and slow as if paranoid of wandering ears.

**Touches** all conversations and takes thorough notes (best do the same).

**Hears** whispers from the earth about...*things*.

*    Martial class - the legendary warrior or weapon whispers challenges and past victories
*    Divine class - your patron, god, or spirit whispers disappointments and shortcomings
*    Arcane class - spells whisper their locations and taunt you to find them

**Smells** your past in colors, and paints them accordingly.

*    Violet - violent past
*    Blue - sad past
*    Red - edgy past
*    Green - adventurous life
*    Yellow - happy life
*    Orange - lots of fire
*    Indigo - royal life
*    Black - death...
*    White - boring life

**Tastes** the passage of time and how it affects you.

*    Can tell how old you are
*    Where you were born
*    How long it took you to mature
*    When you are supposed to die
*    When you will actually die

**Sees** emotions as creatures which must be tamed, defeated, or nurtured.

-----------------------------------------------------

WHEN
---
Right now. Roll up a character.

----------------------------------------------------

WHERE
---
I have no fuckin' clue. But there are two points in your world that need to be traversed and instead of preparing a hex crawl, you're taking the Snake Train. Along the way you'll run into some things. Things that might not exist in your world, but I assume Snake Trains don't either. So let's get weird.

---------------------------

**WHY**

D8| Common reasons
---|---
1.|   It's faster than all other known travel besides teleportation (which is expensive!)
2.|  It goes to places that no other transportation will take you
3.| It's the ONLY way to get to this super secret/dangerous place
4.| It's a religious experience for various snake priests and reptile gods
5.| It's a wonder in the magical world and often under much examination by the colleges
6.| There are people on the Snake Train that you need to talk to
6.|  You think you might be the one to get the Snake Train to reveal some deep lore
6.|  DEMONSDEMONSDEMONS

D6| personal motivations
---|---
1.|   Revenge, pure, bloody revenge. The Snake sympathizes and thinks you should never let go.
2.|   Love, a truer love than you will ever feel again. The Snake thinks its in love as well, but that's a story for another time.
3.|   Death, a sudden, unexpected death from far away. The Snake heard about such a thing and saw the body feed the butterflies.
4.|   Escape, from a thing too deep for you to fathom. The Snake keeps its lips locked and tongued curled.
5.|   Force, from an entity that you owe your heart or your head. The Snake laughs, big belly laughs of mockery.
6.|   Curiosity, about things your eyes will never lay on. The Snake knows nothing of such feelings. It sees all. 

---------------------------------------------------

FLYING PAST THINGS WE NEVER NEED - PART 2
---

**While on the train the party will pass several landmarks and interesting things to look at.** 

*    Three rocs flying overhead, blotting out the sun for a full minute.
*    A desert pocket, maybe 10' across, passing by like slats in a picket fence
*    Two dragons mating, flying high into the air, grasping claws, and falling towards the ground 
*    Upwards rain, the ground opening in tiny mouths where the rain falls out of and forms clouds     of nightmare creatures in the sky
*    Several thousand troops marching across a rocky steppe, missing limbs, wounded from a    previous battle
*    A giant woman using the side of a mountain as a canvas



**Different NPCs** will talk to the party and the Snake Train will make its judgements and take its notes. This will be fun on its own, but in case its not or there are some lapses of drama, here are some events that could happen involving the NPCs.



**Princess Harroway** playing the flute while **Goner** listens, smiling gently and swaying a little. The song Harroway plays is one of lonesome worry. She wrote it herself on her first day on the Snake Train. Goner will ask Harroway to play another song which she carries on her person, wrapped in a leather case.

THE GREAT BIG ROCK - PART 3
---
The Snake Train grinds to a halt in a grand plain dominated by a monolith of obsidian, casting a bladed shadow across the land. Across its surface are white chalk drawings ranging from childish to grandiose. Around the base are bits and sticks of chalk, all white. 

Drawing on the rock is like a question. And it will answer with a drawing in turn. The complexity of the drawing may or may not help the rock with its response. The responses are meant to be cryptic, for the rock is really a nymph who has been cursed into this rock for thousands of years without sound so sight. She will do what she can to let the players know she is trapped through her answers. But remember, all answers must be illustrations. No words allowed. 

**THE SHADOW**

If the party is there for more than few minutes, they will notice that the shadow of this rock never moves. The shadow is the creature trapping the Nymph, and defeating it will release her. While the creature is a shadow, it is impossible to harm or wound it with weapons. Only by getting rid of the shadow entirely will the creature be defeated.

**Some specifics**

* The shadow is about 45’ long, 15’ wide at the base, tapering toa  jagged point.
* The shadow will never move, even as the sun crosses the sky. 
* When the sun goes down, the shadow effectively spreads everywhere there isn’t light and traps others inside the rock. 
* The only form of light that will not affect the shadow is illusory magic. 

The trick is to see if the party can come up with something before sundown, when they either leave or get swallowed into the rock itself.

**THE NYMPH**

Her name is Gahanna

* Says she’s forever grateful for being freed and owes her entire life to you
* Doesn’t say that she really fucking means it, she’s so fucking thankful that she cries
* Actively Hides that from now on she will do anything, ANYTHING, to protect you

She’s druidic, against all things metal and civilized, and will try to sway you to this belief over time. Undramatic, aromantic, and completely bisexual. Her singing voice is rivaled by few and she will sing songs from before time. Songs that make you dream of savage lands and animals that can eat giants. 

If Goner is on the train, Gahanna will fall in love with her.

---------------------------------------------

NEXT STOP

Where will the Snake Train go from here? Your parents’ house? The infinite library? Wonderland? Guess we’ll have to stay tuned and find out next issues. Until then--

Good luck, don’t die.

This is a dungeon that I built with the help of The Gollicking Writer's Collective. Specifically, u/Mimir-Ion and u/M0rdenkainen. They really helped me reach deep inside myself to find the seething hatred for my players that I needed to make this dungeon. They brainstormed the gates with me, and made this all possible.

#***Lore Dump***

Beneath the island of Santini is a vault, containing the ancient evil known as ""Nergal"". In the lore of my setting, Nergal is an eldritch abomination; an avatar of malice who would consume all that lies within reality. Really though, you can put whatever you want within the vault. I'm going to proceed as though Nergal; Avatar of Malice is what lies within.

*After the Shadar-Kai were purged from The Feywild, Queen Tatiana named eleven of her noblest Eladrin knights to pursue Nergal into The Material Plane.*

*Tatiana’s rainbow guard eventually cornered Nergal on the island of Santini, and imprisoned him within an inescapable vault. Unable to kill the spirit of malice, they devised a series of gates that would prevent any ally of primal chaos from entering the vault and freeing Nergal.*

*The Rainbow Guard swore vigilance over Nergal’s vault, and swore that their spirits would guard the vault until the end of days. They built the great city of Santini, and bound their descendants to that same oath. They built great temples to the volcano god, Kilauea, and prospered upon his slopes. As the march of millenia continued, the descendants of Tatiana’s Rainbow Guard forgot what lay beneath the ground they walked upon. Nergal became a bogeyman; a thing to scare little Elven children with. The Rainbow Guard, with their shimmering fey blades, were mythical guardians who watched over good little elves in their sleep.*

*When The Doom came to Santini, the truth of Nergal’s existence was pushed out of legend, and into chilling, cold reality. Firsthand reports from the children who survived The Doom of Santini describe an “evil shadow” sweeping across the island, dueling with the specters of knights who wielded rainbow blades.*

*Today, Santini is infamous for being a literal ghost city. The spirits of those who died during The Doom are trapped on the island; unable to move on to the Elven afterlife because a powerful, malevolent will holds them there. For two-thousand years, these souls have replayed the last days of their lives over and over. Through the ages, many heroes, clerics and wise folk have tried to ease the suffering of the spirits trapped upon Santini, but none have prevailed.*

*There are many journals and firsthand accounts of a dark cave near the base of Kilauea’s Western slope, from whence a great evil radiates. Though many brave souls have entered the cave, few have ever exited. Those that have “survived” the cave have described a chilling, all-consuming hatred that sought to strip them of everything.*

***Panther’s Note -*** This dungeon is specifically meant for groups who are heavy into role-play, and very heavily invested in their characters. Additionally, this dungeon should only be run with a group that you can trust to remain friends after the dungeon is complete. Seriously, an actual shouting match broke out at my table when I ran it. I strongly recommend that you stop to consider the impact that this dungeon will have upon your players before you run it.


#***Philosophy and Mechanics***

The Vault of Malice is like an exercise in the “Sunk Cost Fallacy”. It is also a test of their character. How much are your players willing to pay in order to end an undeniable evil? Are they truly righteous? Will they really sacrifice everything in the name of Good?

The ancient Elven architects of The Vault intended it to be the eternal prison for an eldritch abomination of hatred.

I have no map for this dungeon, but you can think of it as a long tunnel with a series of magical archways or “gates”. To proceed through the tunnel, you have to awaken or “open” a gate with a specific sacrifice. Each gate will have a cryptic description of what it requires in order to be opened.

At the end of the tunnel is a big, heavy, metal box. Inside that box is Nergal.

If you go through a gate without “opening” it/awakening the magic, you will simply proceed through the tunnel until you come upon the same gate again. No amount of teleportation, aetherial walking, or other kind of crazy inter-dimensional bull-crap will allow you to proceed through the tunnel. The only way through is to open a gate and step through it.

Handwave whatever rules you like, to justify this to your players. Keep in mind that this vault was devised by The First Elves on the specific orders of The Summer Court. It is highly magical, and quite inescapable. There is no going backwards through the dungeon. The only way to leave the dungeon once you pass through the first gate is to exit through a “Gate of Mercy”, or via *Wish*. (I suppose, “The Lady of Pain” could help, if she exists in your setting).

The “gates” were originally intended to be tests of character that would prevent evil beings from being able to reach Nergal, and free him. However, over the course of several thousand years, Nergal’s evil will has warped the gates. Now, they exist solely to break down the spirit of any who would approach the vault. The more chaos, suffering and pain that Nergal can cause within reality, the more powerful he becomes.

Each gate has a cryptic message written upon it, explaining what kind of sacrifice is required.

This message is instantly comprehended in whatever the native tongue of the reader is. The fun of this dungeon is not in the puzzle of “What will this gate do to me?” but rather “Oh God. How do we choose our sacrifices?”. If your players are less clever than mine, feel free to make the cryptic warnings more explicit.


Any condition or effect caused by the Vault of Malice should be regarded as permanent. In my setting, Nergal is an extension of the Titan of Chaos; his power supersedes The Gods. Not even a God can undo the effects of a gate.

If your players are the types to go camping in a dungeon, and they fall asleep while anywhere past the Gate of Wealth, then their minds will become infected with Nergal's evil will. They will roll their saves against Nergal's magical attacks and abilities at disadvantage. 

***Panther’s Note -*** According to my own lore, *Wish* channels the power of primordial creation. *Wish* can supersede anything; one instance of *Wish* can undo the effects of one gate effect… You may, of course, decide otherwise.



#***Setup***

This dungeon is the most effective if your players are motivated by an altruistic desire, rather than a greedy one. “Stop the evil” rather than “Get the l00t”. However, feel free to populate the inner vault with all kinds of fancy loot. I recommend “Rainbow Blades”, which are “Sun Blades” that deal whatever type of damage the wielder chooses. 

3 of my 4 players had personal reasons for venturing into The Vault to kill Nergal. I recommend you tailor the evil within The Vault to whatever would be most likely to motivate your players all the way through.

#####Lord Brightblade 


This dungeon is most chilling if you present the players with somebody who *failed* to reach the end. In my game, this was an elven paladin named Lord Brightblade.

Lord Percivale Milliardo Brightblade is a sun elf paladin, head of the Brightblade Clan, wielder of The Brightblade (an artifact sword of great renown), defender of orphans, war hero and all-around good guy. He is basically an elven version of Captain America. He has been a recurring NPC for the last 3 years, and he’s quite popular with my players (His adopted daughter, Tai’irri, is an NPC sidekick in the party).

Lord Brightblade heard of the players’ ambition to reach The Vault of Malice, and free the lost spirits of Santini. Over a hard glass of whiskey, Lord Brightblade gave a chilling, half-forgotten account of how he had failed to pass even the third gate, and he had lived with the shame of his wasted sacrifices ever since. He told the players that he spoken with a spirit, who said there were at least seven gates... My players took all of this under advisement, but ultimately decided to go for it. Lord Brightblade gave them what info he was able to recall, and begged Tai’irri not to accompany them. 

**Panther’s Note -** If you want to make this a little easier on your players, you can have a ghost standing outside of the tunnel. This ghost will be helpful, and give the players the names of each gate, so that they know a little about what to expect (I did this for my players).



##The Vault

As the players approach the gates, they should notice that the walls of the stone tunnel are now polished, black glass (think The Vietnam Memorial). At first, the reflections will be “normal”. After each gate, the players should be able to see reflections of what they have just sacrificed. If your players attack the visions in any way, the mirrored walls should shatter easily. Each time a wall is attacked, 7 mirror-beasts should immediately attack your players. Scale this however you like; I recommend using Displacer Beast stats from the Monster Manual.


#***The Gates***

You are free to rearrange the gates into any order you choose; the order I have placed them is the order that I predicted would cause the most pain and suffering to MY players. I have included my players’ solution to each gate.

***Panther's Note -*** The Gate of Material Wealth, The Gate of Future, and the Gates of Mercy are the only gates that require the entire party to make a sacrifice. All other gates are a singular sacrifice... Unless you're really, really sadistic.


***Gate of Material Wealth***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever passes through this gate must make a sacrifice of their material wealth.”*

**Effect:** This gate requires a sacrifice of gold. Specifically, gold. Anybody who walks through this gate will lose all of their gold. This means gold-plated stuff. Gold in their pockets. Non-liquid gold assets in another location, and any piles of gold that they left sitting in a pile outside of the tunnel. There is no cheating the gates; all of their gold will disappear out of existence once they walk through this gate. 


**My Players:** The very first gate was oddly difficult for my players. They spent about 30 minutes testing the gate, to see what would happen. The Paladin, and the “ascetic-hippy” Bard had no issue with the gate. The Wizard deeply regretted that he hadn’t spent his money on more scrolls before going in. The cleric was a Cleric of the Forge, and he had plated his armor in gold. He was very bitter about losing his gold plating. They knew that this gate was coming, because Lord Brightblade warned them about it.


***Gate of Past***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must recite a great deed that they have accomplished.”*

**Effect:** This gate will undo a past deed that a player performed. This may cause a significant chunk of your setting history to be rewritten, or simply, somebody else took care of the problem. DM may have discretion on whether or not a deed was great enough to open the gate. DM may have discretion on whether or not “lesser” deeds are also erased.

**My Players:** The Paladin undid that time he freed a captured princess by instigating a slave revolt in The Pirate Isles. Because this slave revolt was undone, the slaves of Chain Town were never set free. The historical rewrite became that, after waiting for her sister, The Empress, to send official rescuers, Princess Lucia lost faith with The Holy Empire. She eventually freed herself, forswore her oath to The Imperial Navy and became a vicious Pirate Queen. 


***Gate of Ego***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must sacrifice their ego.”*

**Effect:** This gate requires a sacrifice of the “lasting memory” of a character. After that character is dead, nobody will remember their deeds. They will exist vaguely in the minds of those that they loved, but there will be no clear memories of that person. History will completely forget them.


**My Players:** This gate confused my players for a while. They didn’t know what it meant to “sacrifice their ego”. Also, according to Lord Brightblade’s account, this should have been the Gate of Love. I allowed my players to make Insight, History and Arcana checks to determine what would happen to them if they sacrificed their ego. The Bard eventually made the sacrifice. In the mirrors after this, I showed him a vision of all his poems and songs being misattributed to other bards.


***Gate of Love***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must speak the name of someone cherished and beloved.”*

**Effect:** This gate will irrevocably, and instantly, kill the person who is named.

**My Players:** This is where the dungeon got interesting. I placed the first Gate of Mercy near this gate. I also placed an elven skeleton, wearing exquisite Elven plate mail, propped up against the wall in this room. Important to note that, short of *Wish*, death is permanent in my setting. After the use of some spells, my players made contact with the ghost of these bones; Lord Tristain Brightblade. The elder, and all-around better, brother of Percivale Brightblade. Tristain and his younger brother had entered the dungeon together, intent on freeing the suffering souls of Santini. Tristain had sacrificed his ego before the previous gate. The brothers had quarreled here, at the Gate of Love, and each refused to be the one to go forward. As their supply of water began to run low, Tristain finally prevailed. The elder Brightblade had refused to drink another drop, until Percivale was convinced to open the gate. Tristain died in the tunnel, and due to the sacrifice of Ego, Percivale forgot him. This gate is where my players got into a shouting match. Prior to the dungeon, I made a shortlist of all the characters that my players could name, that I would accept. Eventually, the Forge Cleric named his aged grandfather. The gate opened, Tai’Irri and the Cleric gathered up Tristain’s bones into a Bag of Holding, and everyone proceeded through.


***Gate of Life***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must forswear the gift of the Gods of Life.”*

**Effect:** This will sterilize a character. They will be incapable of siring/bearing children, unless *Wish* is involved.

**My Players:** This was a particularly malicious dig at my players. We’ve all been gaming together a long time, and they are all very invested in having “legacy characters”. Children or grandchildren of their previous characters. One player (The Bard) is on his 3rd generation. Another (The Cleric) is on his 2nd generation. Anywho, The Paladin opened this one. His character is literally the last of his order/house, who were sworn to end Nergal, and he thought it was fitting. The mirrors after this gate showed a series of children vanishing from existence. My players “realized” that this gate must be why Lord Percivale Brightblade adopted Tai’irri, rather than marry and sire his own natural heir. (That’s not really why, but it is now!) 


***Gate of Future***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would cross this gate must forswear their future success.”*

**Effect:** Give each player a nat-1 chip. At DM’s discretion, use that nat-1 chip to turn a roll into a nat-1.

**My Players:** They figured this out very quickly, and accepted their nat-1 chips.


***Gate of Innocence***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate may do so by speaking the name of an innocent person.”*

**Effect:** Kill that innocent person.

**My Players:** The Bard had a “pet” parrot named Bo-Bo, who had been “awakened” by the Awaken spell, during an adventure several months ago. Since he had been awakened, Bo-Bo was technically a “person”. He had never lied, stolen, cheated or whatever. They killed Bo-Bo. This is the seventh gate, and it is the gate where Lord Percivale Brightblade gave up, and left through a Gate of Mercy.


***Gate of Body***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must make a sacrifice of their body.”*

**Effect:** This gate will reset a character’s hitpoints to be the minimum they could have rolled.

**My Players:** My players misunderstood this gate. The Cleric cut off his ear, and said “I sacrifice my body.”. CON was his dump stat, and he was reset to ~27 health, at level 14. He got very angry, so the Bard tried Greater Restoration on him… I allowed it to work, since I didn’t want my player to literally storm out of the room in anger.


***Gate of Death***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must forswear the gift of the Gods of Death.”*

**Effect:** The speaker will become unable to die… THIS IS BAD!

**My Players:** Near this gate, I left “a pancaked corpse of an uncertain race. The body seems more a pile of viscera and broken bones than a true set of remains”. Once my players started investigating the corpse, they discovered that it was still “alive”. The insane corpse told the players of how it gave up the right to die several centuries ago. His adventure companions, a bunch of sadists, had immediately begun to test the limits of this. He had lain here ever since, wishing for death. The Bard eagerly forswore the Gift of Death, since he had given up the ‘right’ to be remembered after his death.


***Gate of Mind***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever would open this gate must make a sacrifice of their mind.”*

**Effect:** Apply permanent madnesses as you see fit. If you use a sanity system in your games, apply sanity damage.

**My Players:** They lied to the “pancake corpse” and told him that they would find a way to kill him, if he would open this gate. The bard rolled a combined 27 on his persuasion check… So, the pancake corpse agreed, sacrificed what little sanity it had, and went absolutely crazy. They stuffed the corpse into their bag of holding (next to Tristain Brightblade's remains) and proceeded on their way. The Pancake Corpse will probably be a villain next campaign.


***Gate of Lies***

**Quote:** *“Your sacrifices are in vain. You have been judged, and found wanting. Turn back, and face what you have lost.”*

**Effect:** Nothing. This gate is a liar, and it is a “stupid test” for your players.

**My Players:** They saw right through this.


***Gate of Mercy***

**Quote:** *“Whosoever passes through this gate will find release from the burden of knowledge.”*

**Effect:** This gate will alter the memories of the characters, and spit them outside the dungeon. Their characters will feel absolute, crushing disappointment at the loss of everything. They will only recall that they were found unworthy, after offering their complete selves to the dungeon. Apply madnesses or sanity damage as your games see fit.

**My Players:** I don’t DM for quitters.

***Panther’s Note -*** Place Gates of Mercy throughout the dungeon, to tempt your players into leaving if they want.

#***The Actual Vault***


The Actual Vault is a HUGE, “metal” box with eldritch symbols upon it. The interior of the vault is 50ft x 50ft. There should be a few dozen corpses of failed adventurers in here, as well as a few crazed, undying zombie-like minions that serve the boss. No amount of teleportation, dimensional travel or magical BS should allow something to cross the walls of the vault. The **only** way in and out of the vault is to go through the heavy, metal door.

**My Players:** I had a miniboss just outside the vault, after the gate of lies. The former ruler of Santini, (Mad) King Rolan. He was completely lost to Nergal’s will, and attacked anyone who approached the vault. During the miniboss fight, I used the stats of the “Moonlight King” found in Kobold Press’ Tome of Beasts.

Because Rolan had passed through the Gate of Death, my players were literally unable to kill him. However, they were able to reason with him, and exorcise Nergal’s evil will from his mind. They gave him a spare weapon, and invited him to help them fight Nergal.

Nergal’s stats were the “Ghoul Emperor” from Tome of Beasts, combined with some abilities from “Star Spawn of Cthulhu” (also Tome of Beasts). Nergal had the star-spawn's ability to disintegrate people, and rebound psychic damage. 

During the second round of combat against Nergal, King Rolan failed a wisdom save, and became dominated by Nergal’s will again. This was a tough fight, but my players survived.",1,The Vault of Malice - A Dungeon Twisted by Hate

Not every scar needs to be the mechanical kind that you see in the DMG. Some can be small scars that your warriors chat over during their dinners or that bards sing about in sordid songs. Below is a way to add some flavor to your character's appearance past the scars you've gotten in your backstory.

1. When your character reaches 0 hp, take note of who has brought them to 0 hp, what type of attack they've used, and how badly the attack hurt your character.
2. Roll a D6 to determine where the scar is located. 1-Head, 2-Left arm, 3-Right arm, 4-Left Leg, 5-Right Leg, 6-Torso.
3. Using the type of damage, the weapon used, and amount of damage, create a scar that will last with your character for life (or at least until they pony up for a regeneration spell).

Example: Shaprtooth Cutting Glittergold (tabaxi Sorcerer)was knocked to 0 hp during a fight with an intelligent weapon. The weapon used a fireball style attack, which caused 20 damage overflow. The player rolls a d6 and gets a 4. The player determines that Sharptooth lost some of the fur on her leg, and now has a bald spot which can be seen when removing her shoes.",1,A Fluff Idea for Scars

#Note: your pantheon can be made of canon D&amp;D gods! 

You don't have to have custom deities to fill the ranks (Mine doesn't! I use most of the Dawn War pantheon). But this will be a project to build a custom framework for fitting in whatever specific gods you want! Those can be ones you've made up or ones like Bahamut and Tiamat. 

This round, we’re going to start taking a look at what defines those beings at the top of the religious food chain. For your world's pantheon, consider the following questions. 
___
1. In comparison to mortals - even powerful mortals, just how much more powerful are your Lesser Deities? 
2. How many lesser deities exist? How does this number compare to the population of Greater deities?
3. How often do Lesser Gods for alliances or strike bargains with your Greater Deities? How often do they strike deals with mortals? What are some examples of these kinds of relationships? 
2. If it’s possible for a new deity to join these ranks, what kind of process does that entail? Would the existing gods allow a new member to join them? If it’s not possible, why not? 
4. Are lesser gods worshiped at all? If so, what kind of benefit (if any) does that worship provide? If not, why not? 
5. Do lesser gods participate in affairs for the greater deities? If so, what might their role look like? If not, why are they excluded or why do they avoid participation? 
6. Do these gods participate in mortal affairs at all? Do they communicate with mortals through powerful clergy, prophets, or oracles?

###Example

1. The Lesser Deities in Pretara are still incredibly powerful and effectively immortal. Their original creature type can vary (Elhonna was a mortal elf before she ascended, for example), but they all have a tiny splinter of divinity that was bestowed upon them by a greater deity. This puts them well above the power of an individual mortal, but they do maintain their corporeal form as mortals do. While they may not need to eat or sleep, they are far easier to kill because their divinity does not sustain their form in the way that a Greater Deity's Shard sustains a higher power. 
2. Lesser gods vastly outnumber greater deities, but are in turn even more outnumbered by mortals. Canon D&amp;D deities such as Elhonna, the archdevils of the Nine Hells, Quorlinn, the Cat Lord, Tyr, Vecna, and Orcus are all considered lesser deities. 
3. All lesser deities have some kind of relationship with whatever deity helped them to ascend. The relationship is not unlike that of a warlock patronage; lesser gods are usually given responsibilities and work to fulfill the requirements of them. Doing so strengthens their patron Greater Deity, which in turns strengthens them. To use Elhonna again as an example- Elhonna has become a guardian of the Grove of Unicorns in the Beastlands (The Plane where Melora lives). Any time that mortals come in person to petition Melora for aid, Elhonna is usually the first being that the petitioner must encounter. In this way, Elhonna is a guardian of a particular grove, but also a guardian of the path to meet with the divine. 
4. Lesser deities are not made very frequently by mortal standards, but they are made occasionally.  This process generally begins when a mortal has dedicated themselves to a particular Ideal, then is offered the chance to become a Champion for that deity, and then maintains that status for enough time to have worked towards advancing their patron's goals. Lesser deities generally cannot interfere with another lesser deity that exists outside the domain of their patron, but for some deities, a task that involves harassing, injuring, or slaying a lesser deity of a rival god might be given.    
5. Lesser deities are not generally worshiped because they are not as well known and are quick to direct worship towards their patron. While worship doesn't actively provide benefits to any deity, it does foster a greater affinity with that particular Greater Deity's Ideal, and so many lesser gods will work more closely with mortals to help encourage that affinity.  
6. Lesser deities are intrinsically involved with their patron. They work to fulfill tasks and to fill gaps as their patron deity requires. Generally this involves being the first to interact with mortals, but can also involve guarding locations, filtering out the unworthy, or whatever tasks are given to them. 
7.  Lesser gods are much more involved with mortal affairs than greater deities. While they don't interact with mortals all the time, they do appear to them as needed by their patron. As a sort of divine middle-person, lesser deities can act as messengers, protectors, challengers, or serve as a challenge. ",1,Build a Pantheon: Lesser Deities
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,44,"Devils are known to seek out humanoids in the prime material plane. What they want from them is to gain their soul through a contract so they will be sent off into the nine hells after death.   
Depending on the alignment of the individual in question, the devils will have a different strategy for trying to get the soul to their side.   
    
- Lawful Evil people rarely enter these contracts due to them already going to the nine hells anyway. The only ones who they target  lean towards law or evil and would end up in Acheron or Gehenna.    
- Lawful Neutral people are shown how this system of law can improve their way of life.    
- Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil people are given a promise of power. This makes up most of the contracts devils have      
- Chaotic neutral people are never targeted by devils as it's not worth their time to try to convert them   
- The only true neutral people devils search out for are desperate. Otherwise they typically aren't idealistic enough to be mislead into a contract.   
   
Truly good people are the hardest for devils to get their hands on. No matter where they are on the lawful to chaotic spectrum, they will know that they would be doing very bad things if they worked with a devil.   
But this conviction is a boon for the devils. And it's the reason why they always try to corrupt the good.   
    
You see, it all goes back to how most devils are born: lemure orientation.    
When a soul goes to the nine hells, they are immediately sent to the lemure fields. There they are transformed into the disgusting form of a lemure. They will stay that way until their endless agony makes them forget about their old life and personality. Other devils will often torment lemures to speed up the process. Not even death can end this process as their hellish rejuvenation brings them back if they die in the nine hells. Once they know nothing but pain, they are gifted the form of an imp which is infinitely better experience than a lemure.   
However, the earth in the nine hells radiates evil energy itself. For evil and neutral creatures, this energy is mostly harmless. But for any good creature, the earth burns any bare skin that touches it. While it is an accidental result of converting a previously neutral plane into a lawful evil one, it also has the effect of making good souls into very powerful devils.   
As a good lemure is thrown into the fields, they immediately start having their lower body be burned by the cursed ground. This effect never stops so they have to manipulate their form to accommodate these hard circumstances. Their previously soft undersides morph into hard unfeeling platforms. While they lose their mobility, they at least don't have to feel the pain of the earth scorching them.   
    
With how much torment these previously good lemures go through, they become much stronger than the average devil. When they ascend to the form of an imp, they have hooves instead of feet; a scar left behind from when they were a lemure with a static underside.  
The hooved imps are noticeably much stronger than their colleagues with feet. So they advance through the hierarchy much faster than other devils. But even once they ascend to higher devilish forms, they will always retain their hooves. Not even illusion or transmutation magic can make these hooves into feet.   
   
Due to these circumstances, devils with hooves are seen as nobles among devil kind. A devil with hooves might even outrank a devil of the rank above them due to their increased aptitude.   
One of the most taboo things a devil can do would be disguising their feet as hooves. That would be stepping out of line and is punishable by reversion to a lemure. However Asmodeus gives permission to archdevils to either have feet or hooves depending on which they prefer.   
Evidence of hooved devils being stronger is clear when looking at the leaders of the nine hells. Zarial, Dispater, Titivilus, Bael, and Moloch are all high ranking devils with hooves instead of feet.    
     
   
***   
    
Now if you like the class division between hoof vs feet devils and want to implement mechanics to follow it, then I'll try to accommodate you. But just to warn you **I am not very good at homebrew**. I'm a writer not a game designer, so I'll warn you that my solutions might not be perfect.    
     
Firstly, you want to set the tone about these devils. Explain how in a pack of devils they all follow the orders of one specific devil.  
But something unique about that devil is that they are likely to be a traditionally lower ranked devil commanding a fleet of higher ranking ones. Such as an imp with hooves commanding a squadron of bearded devils. Or a Merregon with armor covering his legs in an odd way shouting orders to a pair of chain devils.    
    
Stats wise, I think that they get probably an extra two or three points into their strength and dexterity.   
Their mental scores are all boosted significantly though. Intelligence becomes a 16, Wisdom a 14, and Charisma an 18. If they were at these scores or higher, just give them the same bonus that they get with the physical stats.   
You can also give them a few warlock or cleric spells. These are either gifts from the archdevil they work for (warlock), or a gift directly from Asmodeus (cleric).   
   
Their health pool should be increased significantly. I'm thinking that maybe it should be the maximum score for whatever it is for a normal devil.     
    
And maybe a few legendary actions could fit if you really want this hooved devil to feel like a boss. Although devils are diverse enough that they can be tailor suited for the individual devil.

If there's anything you'd change about the mechanics or story behind hooved devils, please let me know",1,"Hooved devils, the result of a good person selling their soul to the nine hells"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,16,342,"Civilization runs on clocks. Whether they be man-made or solar/lunar, people live their lives constrained by the responsibilities of life and time is always important. 

When setting up an urban or rural environment, its good to get into the habit of creating a timetable for your population. It does not need to be fancy, and you can get as detailed as you like, its your choice. 

Here's a basic example:

**Rural**

* Dawn - Household chores. Prayer. Craftsmen begin work. 
* Morning - Outdoor chores, travel
* Noon - Lunch (in situ), more work
* Afternoon - Work
* Sunset - Dinner, camp. Household chores.
* Evening - Prayers. Bed.

**Urban**

* Dawn - Craftsmen begin work. Workers walk to work. Gates open. Temple services.
* Morning - Markets open, shops open. Traffic increases. University/Arts/Sports/Whatever opens. 
* Noon - Lunch. Streets are packed. Vehicle traffic halts. Temple services.
* Afternoon - Work continues. Traffic resumes. 
* Sunset - Work ends. Street traffic heavy then subsides. Temple services. Gates close. 
* Evening. No vehicle traffic. Watch increases. 


You could easily break this down into seasonal tables, or tables by-the-hour, or however you like. Seasonal tables are quite fun, and they add a lot of flavor to your world as holidays and festivals come and go, the weather changes, and so do the necessities of life. Hauling firewood in Winter as opposed to cutting in Autumn means the rhythm of the village is predictable. Life continues and you have a nice template to run stories from. 

NPCs have schedules too, of course, beyond the faceless masses. Its sometimes fun to create daily/weekly schedules for your NPCs if you want that extra layer of realism. Perhaps the party shows up to meet some government official, but he ""doesn't work on Fishday, please come back tomorrow."" 

Some will argue this not fun, and that's a personal choice, so I will not comment on it, only to say that adding schedules should only be done if it increases the joy the DM gets from worldbuilding. If it becomes a chore, dump it. 

In urban environments, NPC schedules can become particularly important, especially in rogue campaigns. If the party is doing heists and other nefarious things to people, its good to know where they will usually be (at least until the PCs interfere). 

It can be something as simple as this: 

***Lolly Dishwater***

**Tavern Owner - The Bludgeoned Barrister**

* 5 am - Rise and breakfast
* 530-615 am - Walk to work
* 630 am - Open the tavern and begin work
* 1 pm - Leave tavern and walk to Silverthorn park to eat lunch and meet with various romantic partners (that don't know about each other)
* 130 - 300 pm - Tryst with lover in nearby rented room (changes daily).
* 300-315 - Walk back to tavern and resume work.
* 11 pm - Leave tavern and walk home. (On Hammerdays, takes a jitney and a local barfly who she's picked up. The barfly always leaves by 8 am the next day, and always on foot).

Hey, guys! A few months ago some friends asked me to run an adventure for a party of kobolds. They seemed to have a blast and I thought others might enjoy it as well. After all, who doesn’t need to unleash their inner kobold once in a while!

[Rise of the Redscales PDF Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYj_-jy95AiWMMuSIGrwH3AVqYp-Te73/view?usp=sharing)

The adventure is designed for a party of **4th-level kobold characters**, though other monstrous minions who serve dragons could fit in as well. 

**The setting** is a massive dragon's lair, a cavernous complex littered with powerful items and challenges not quite suited for little kobolds. (I wouldn't call it a dungeon crawl though.)

**The premise** is simple. The players take control of the best and brightest among the kobold tribe known as the Redscales. Their entire lives they have been the Dragon Queen's minions and her lair's caretakers. But the Dragon Queen has been gone for some time now and an ancient feud with another kobold tribe (the Bluescales) is about to be a rekindled. And the trap- and treasure-filled lair is about to become their battleground.

**The gameplay** is a mix of roleplaying, involving some tough moral choices (well, tough for kobolds), solving puzzles and wacky combat with kobolds wielding powerful ancient artifacts. The intention was to make an adventure with an abundance of magic items, specially chosen for their potential to lead to hilarious situations.  

As far as **length** is concerned, the adventure was designed as a one-shot, but if the players decide to explore every nook and cranny, or go down the path of one of the longer endings, it might take as long as two sessions. 

**The bestiary** includes eight new stat blocks for enemy kobolds armed to the teeth with magical gear!

**Alternatively**, this adventure can be adapted for a regular adventuring party of tier 3 or 4. In a campaign I was running, the players managed to slay my ancient red dragon before it could retreat to its lair. I had hyped up said lair as this enormous place filled with treasures, and the players were naturally eager to loot it. Which sounded a little too easy to me (every session needs at least a little bit of tension!), so I decided to spice up their expedition by adding the two kobold tribes from this adventure. Those *helms of brilliance* and *staves of power* that my players desired weren't just lying around, waiting for an adventurer to claim them. The kobolds had managed to get to them first.  

Anyway, I hope someone finds this useful or entertaining! This my first time writing a proper module and all feedback is welcome. I'd also be happy to hear what other interesting locations you might include inside an ancient dragon's lair. :)
",1,Rise of the Redscales - a 5e one-shot adventure for an all-kobold party
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,49,562,"Breaking Bad is a masterclass of tension. I have learned a lot about Game Mastering from this show, and it's a set of lessons that do not fit with the other, more episodic and cartoonish lessons from previous articles. 

1 Spinning Plates
---
* From season to seaon, Breaking Bad is an artful version of a circus act, as Walter White starts spinning plates on precarious sticks. 
* The first are his backstory, his issues with his stagnant life, and his emasculation
* Then comes the cancer. And the drugs. The money in the vent. The *murder*
* The tension of this show comes from watching him balance these plates, putting them down just as they're about to fall, making art out of the ones that do fall, and throwing them all up in the air at the end of the show.
* This is what I'm trying to do in a non-episodic campaign

2 Location
---
* Breaking Bad is about a location and in spending time in that location we get to know it
* Having a singular location, like a city, or a region, allows for a baseline
* What better way to show the affect the PCs have than through gradual change?
* It also breeds familiarity, which allows for attachment
* In Breaking Bad we see this in season 2 with the airplane and in the final season with the condemned house
* Even a subtle thing like that can show what happens when the PCs start dropping plates
* Having a centralized location also helped me when it came to establishing relationships

3 Characters
---
* This can mean the Players, but more so this is about the NPCs that your players change
* Looking at Breaking Bad, I wanted to make NPCs that would become spinning plates for the party to balance
* Walter has his wife, his son, Jesse, Hank, Marie, and his newborn child.
* There are moments where each of these plates are tumbling down around Walter and he has to use his...I hate to say Charisma, but yeah
* I wanted NPCs that I could use to build this tension
* Promises, threats, quests, needs, wants, dreams, nightmares. All of these things are tools I, as a DM, can use to unbalance these plates and force tension

4 Relationships
---
* This is the biggest tool of all. Relationships, mixed with characters and a static location.
* Relationships are not always romantic or personal, like Walter and Skyler
* They exist between your players and factions. Having factions in your world with relationships between each other makes the simple act of your Players entering this world a mess of spinning plates 
* If you get in with one faction, another might hate you. Betray one and several might want you on their side.
* In Breaking Bad, there's the Cartel, Gustavo, the DEA. These three factions are in a constant state of conflict and as soon as Walter enters into it he's forced to balance even more tension

5 Toy box
---
* My goal after rewatching Breaking Bad, is to create a toy box for my players.
* Albuquerque is a toybox in Breaking Bad
* It has factions, romance, guns, gangs, drugs, explosives, hidden drug factories, criminal NPCs, and even more drugs
* If I create a few factions, NPCs, and a decent region, the party will navigate it, creating their own relationships and wind up balancing so many various plates that they all end up crashing down in one big climax

6 Slow Burn vs. Episodic
---
* In the end, the true lesson from Breaking Bad is the idea of a slow burn. 
* In an Episodic adventure the idea is that every session has its own little arc and interesting bits and pieces.
* In a slow burn, Breaking Bad adventure it's about giving up a strong start and super active villains and all that other shit in exchange for letting the players just...go. 
* They will get themselves in trouble. They will talk to people. They will lie and cheat and steal and make friends with so many people. And they will be clever. 
* My party avoided danger for two whole sessions. Nearly 7 hours of playing total. They navigated several witch covens who hated each other and they avoided conflict for a very long time with their creativity. 
* But last session ended with a plate slipping. And they all might come down next session.

I wanted to have a resource I could turn to whenever my players asked about random books they find in homes/workshops/libraries/etc. but I also wanted to have options that gave a sense of history and continuity that wasn't just stuff pulled off the top of my head.

Past the northern gates and the watchtowers, an enchanted forest full of sylvan creatures borders the town, ever alive and always watching. Nestled between the town and the forest is the Mad Bakery: a bakery and a wizard’s laboratory rolled into one.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,79,829,"Inspired by the threads on ""silly cursed weapons"" and ""useless magical items"", I'm adding a colorful gnome merchant to my campaign who carries a bunch of weird magical items, ranging from useless to potentially crucial. Some of them were just standard items that I renamed (like changing ""Immovable Rod"" to ""Stiffy Staff""), or just twisted versions of existing items or spells, but others are completely made up.

My hope is that many of the the items will seem weak or useless at first (even to the merchant himself!), but that the players will figure out clever ways of using them. For instance, the Airmail Envelope (a paper airplane that floats 30ft toward whoever you name) may have been created as a tavern trick, but it could be used to track people down by figuring out which direction to travel. Let me know if you see any other creative uses!

&amp;#x200B;

**Airmail Envelope**

*A folded envelope made of brown paper.*

If a name is whispered to this envelope and it is thrown into the air, it will fold itself into a triangle and drift toward the creature who was named. It cannot travel more than 30ft, and you must have seen or spoken to the target before.

&amp;#x200B;

**Zippy Skippies**

*A small leather pouch filled with 5 flat pebbles.*

When one of the pebbles is thrown onto a liquid, it will bounce at least five times. After the fifth bounce, the pebble becomes an ordinary stone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Poser Composer**

*A wooden mandolin with strings of different colors.*

Each note played on this mandolin blends euphoniously with the notes played before it, forming a pleasing melody regardless of which strings are plucked. Grants +5 to Performance checks using this instrument.

&amp;#x200B;

**Zoomy Bloomies**

*A small cloth pouch filled with about a hundred tiny seeds.*

When one of these seeds is placed on a surface made of earth or wood, it instantly takes root and sprouts a colorful flower.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sandwriting**

*A yellow cloth pouch with a tight silk drawstring.*

Contains three handfuls of grey dust. If you take a handful, speak a message to it, and throw it into the air, it will briefly spell the message in the air, then fall and disappear. The message must be in Common, and 10 words long or less.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deathoscope**

*A collapsible brass telescope with no lenses.*

Looking at a creature through this telescope will show a color indicating how long the creature has been dead. White = Not dead; Green = &lt;1m, Yellow = &lt;10 days, Orange = &lt;100 years, Red = &lt;200 years, Black = longer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Muffle Puffer**

*A long shiny tobacco pipe made of smooth dark wood.*

As an action, you can inhale through the pipe. On your next turn, as an action, the pipe can cast the Message cantrip, allowing you to whisper a short message that is only heard by one creature that you are looking toward.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mouthbeast**

*A brown wool sock with two pebbles stuck to the top.*

Once per day, you can use this puppet to cast Speak With Animals, allowing you to communicate with beasts for 10 minutes. However, beasts can only comprehend you if they can see the puppet and you mimic your speech through it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lungs of Tongues**

*A set of ordinary-looking bellows, shrunk to 6 inches long.*

Can be used to translate languages. For up to 6 seconds, you can pull air into the bellows within hearing distance of a speaking creature. If you then push the air out directly into your ear, you will hear what the creature said in Common.

&amp;#x200B;

**Masquereggs**

*A cushioned box with 2 ordinary-looking chicken eggs.*

By cracking one of these eggs over your head, you can cast Disguise Self, allowing you to change your appearance for 1 hour. The egg is destroyed in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**Moon Boots**

*A pair of pink leather boots with white soles.*

Once per day, as a bonus action, you can use these boots to cast Jump on yourself, tripling your jump distance for 1 minute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quaker Oaks**

*A lacquered wooden jewelry box with three acorns inside.*

As an action, you may throw an acorn to suddenly grow a large oak tree within 30ft of you. The tree takes up a 10ft square and is 80ft tall. Any creatures in the affected space are thrown 10ft, knocked prone, and take 2d8 damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ash Light**

*A small oil lantern with glass windows stained by soot.*

Rather than emitting light, this lantern absorbs it. While lit, everything in a 15ft radius of the lantern becomes dimly lit if it would usually be fully lit, and becomes total darkness if it would usually be dim.

&amp;#x200B;

**Earmugs**

*A pair of ordinary-looking pewter mugs.*

If you put either of these mugs to your ear, you can hear as if your ear was located at the mouth of the other mug. This effect works both ways, though the volume of the emitted sound rapidly fades over 3ft. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Giver Quiver**

*The swirls carved into the leather glow a faint green.*

This quiver magically supplies an arrow up to 50 times per day, one at a time, upon hearing the command words “thank you”. These arrows count as magical for purposes of determining damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lucky Ducky**

*A grey pebble that vaguely looks like a duck’s head.*

Once per day, if this stone is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability roll, or saving throw you dislike. You must use this ability before hearing the result of the roll you are replacing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Flitter Slippers**

*A pair of soft leather boots with tiny feathers on the ankles.*

Once per day, as an action, you can activate these boots to gain 5ft flying speed for one minute, after which the effect ends instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Buffalo Rings**

*A set of three rings, each carved with the image of a bison.*

Once per day, as an action, you can cast Scorching Ray: Shoot three rays of fire at any target(s) within 120ft. Use your spellcasting ability for the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.",1,A few silly magical items for my current campaign...
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,20,244,"# The Quote Book

*wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

The Quote Book is an eldritch, sentient magical artifact. It is known to follow the adventures of random adventuring parties throughout the realms. None live who know what criterion the book uses to choose its masters, though certain archmagi have noted it will follow groups that become great heroes later in life.

The Quote Book can attune to up to 12 creatures at once. It decides who it attunes to and will form that bond instantly. Its attunement does not count against a creature's attunement limit. Despite being capable of such a feat, it often binds itself to one group of four adventurers at a time.

The book follows its chosen masters with a flying speed of 60 ft (it can hover). It can also cast the *invisibility* spell on itself at will, as though it were a creature. If it is separated from its masters by more than 100 feet, it will cast *dimension door* or *teleport* (with 100% accuracy) until it is beside one of them again.

The book will spontaneously write in itself with unerasable, non-smearing ink. This will sometimes be what one of its masters said, or something said by an entirely unknown entity about its masters' current situation.

**Sentience.** The Quote Book is a sentient lawful neutral magic item. It has an Intelligence of 20, Wisdom of 15, and Charisma of 11. The book cannot communicate its own thoughts by any means, and it has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It wants only to record notable, and often comedic moments in the adventures of its chosen masters for all millennia.

**Nondetection.** The Quote Book defies attempts to magically locate it. It cannot be detected by any divination magic (this includes the *see invisibility* and *trueseeing* spells), nor perceived through magical scrying sensors.

**Destroying the Book.** Only the Overgod Ao can choose to destroy the book. When they do, the book emits an ear-splitting screech that passes through all realms, as the divine flames that consume it destroy the history it has amassed.",1,The Quote Book | Wondrous Item (Artifact) [OC]

#Note: your pantheon can be made of canon D&amp;D gods! 

You don't have to have custom deities to fill the ranks (Mine doesn't! I use most of the Dawn War pantheon). But this will be a project to build a custom framework for fitting in whatever specific gods you want! Those can be ones you've made up or ones like Bahamut and Tiamat. 

This round, we’re going to start taking a look at what defines those beings at the top of the religious food chain. For your world's pantheon, consider the following questions. 
___
1. In comparison to lesser deities or immortal champions, just how much more powerful are your Greater Deities? (You don’t need to define power levels for Lesser Deities - that’s the next event!)
2. Do your greater deities have alliances with other deities? Do they find friendship or hostility in these types of relationships? 
2. If it’s possible for a new deity to join these ranks, what kind of process does that entail? Would the existing gods allow a new member to join them? If it’s not possible, why not? 
3. What would happen if a human appeared within arms reach of a greater deity? What happens if a human were to physically touch the god?
4. How do these gods feel about people that worship them? Does the worship provide any practical benefit? 
5. Do these gods participate in mortal affairs at all? Do they communicate with mortals through powerful clergy, prophets, or oracles? Do they reward or punish their followers? 

___
#Do NOT submit a new post. Write your work in a comment under this post. And please include a link to your previous posts in this series!

Remember, this post is only for Greater Deities, you’ll get to share all of your ideas in future posts, let them simmer in your head for a while.

Also, don’t forget that commenting on other people’s work with constructive criticism is highly encouraged. Help each other out.

###Example

1. In Pretara, Greater deities are defined by the Shard of Divinity that they possess. They have pretty much unlimited power as long as something falls in their domains. Cultivation can create life and cause things to grow on a whim. Desolation can calm emotions and create empty voids. Autonomy cannot be captured, and so on. Problems can arise when conflicting Ideals are near each other, and so most deities avoid one another even if their Ideals align well. 
2. Regardless of how well deities get along, they do not ever physically manifest near another. Part of this is due to their connection to their home plane (to be expanded on in a future event), but part of it is to avoid problems that could destroy their physical forms. Often, deities will create a Champion to do their bidding. These Champions are invested with a small portion of the god's power, and are able to interact with the champions of other gods, or even travel to visit another deity in person. 
3. New deities can Ascend in the realms of Pretara, but to do so they must destroy an existing god and claim their Shard of Divinity. Other members of the pantheon could not interfere directly, but could assist a targeted deity by sending a champion to help. 
4. Assuming that the god in question is willing to allow it, their physical presence doesn't harm mortals in their vicinity. Even physical contact isn't inherently harmful. That said, most deities can create an aura around them that deals an appropriate type of damage or simply banish mortals that are not native to the location. 
5. My pantheon doesn't require worship, but instead gains power from mortals acting in line with their Ideal. When people choose to act with honor, some of the energy of that action goes to Honor. When people achieve their goals, power is given to Ambition. If people try to maintain peace and work together, power is given to Harmony. There are certainly people that do worship the gods, and those people will tend to act in line with whatever god they worship, but the actual worship does not provide any real benefit. 
6. Most gods do not interact directly with mortals. Even the most dedicated may only ever interact with a Champion. In times of dire need, or if a god needs something done with urgency, they can choose to send visions or dreams to a specific humanoid. Generally, a deity can reward someone that is dedicated to them by investing power into them, and a deity can always strip that person of power. But they cannot punish people beyond that unless the person is within their realms. ",1,Let's Build a Pantheon: Greater Deities
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,67,900,"Ever wanted a character in your party to have a mental breakdown? Ever wonder why a party of adventurers seem to be unphased by the horrors of combat? The stress system is designed to deal with this problem, as well as create situations for roleplay!

The stress system is based on the exhaustion system, overhauling exhaustion and adding a new system entirely for stress. I'll start with the changes to exhaustion:

**Exhaustion**

1 - 
Disadvantage on physical* ability checks

2 - 
Speed halved

3 - 
Disadvantage on attack rolls and physical* saving throws

4 - 
Hit point maximum halved

5 - 
Speed reduced to 0

6 - 
Death

Exhaustion is caused by a variety of things. You, as the DM, decide when it is appropriate to give a player a level of exhaustion. Here are some potential causes for exhaustion:

* Lack of sleep
* Starvation
* Long-term exposure to heat or cold
* Disease
* Blood loss (not healing after a battle)
* etc.

Exhaustion would be removed in the normal fashion (a long rest, potions of Greater Restoration and Vitality, or high quality meals). 



**STRESS**

1 - 
Disadvantage on mental* ability checks

2 - 
Gain one of the following debuffs until stress is reduced to 0 (choose one):

* Distracted - AC reduced by 2.
* Headaches - Proficiency bonus not added to ability checks or saving throws.
* Pessimism - Critical successes are treated as normal rolls.
* Dread - Always place last on initiative order.

3 - 
Sleep does not heal exhaustion (nightmares) and disadvantage on mental* saving throws

4 - 
Mental* ability scores halved

5 - 
50% chance for DM to control any given action made by the player


EDIT: After receiving some feedback, I think a better way to handle level 5 stress would be to have the player experience hallucinations, hear voices in their head, experience powerful urges to do things they normally wouldn't, and other mind-altering events. Keep in mind that, at level 5 exhaustion, *the character's speed is reduced to zero*. Level 5 is an extremely intense level of stress.


6 - 
Insanity and permanent debuff


Some potential causes for stress include entering a battle against a difficult opponent, making a critical failure or suffering a critical hit (and failing a wisdom saving throw), negative social encounters, etc. 

Some ways to remove stress would include receiving encouragement from members of your party, performing an action that has sentimental value to the character, winning a battle without taking damage, etc.

The idea behind stress is that it's not just the kind of stress you experience every day when completing a hard task. This is lasting, lingering stress - the kind that makes you doubt yourself, your friends, your ability to complete the quest, and ultimately your concept of how the world works. It has your players answer the question of what their characters do to de-stress, or how they would try to help a party member suffering from stress. The system should definitely be modified and personalized to fit the tone of your campaign, but hopefully this sparks some ideas on how you can drive your players insane!

*Physical ability scores would be STR, DEX, and CON, while mental ability score would be INT, WIS, and CHA.",1,The Stress System: AKA Darkest Dungeons and Dragons
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,118,"One thing that has bothered me with Dnd worlds is how magic is interweaved into the world. What I mean to say by this is that I feel that magic in many mainline Dnd worlds is an afterthought, tacked onto the setting after they finish adding all of the ""important"" parts. To me, magic is an incredibly integral part of any setting and when building a world is one of the most important things to consider. 

[Last week I wrote about how to bake magic into your setting in the first place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/al6ms7/building_a_world_with_magic_first/) You guys analyzed my post pretty thoroughly and came up with your own numbers, that I personally believe make more sense. /u/Koosemose in particular, broke down the system I laid out and made it more accurate. His conclusion was that you could reach 5th level, given 8 years of studying. This changes the world to have spells as high as 3rd level appearing fairly commonly, provided the education is there. This is assuming a safe and controlled environment, where anyone can level up given enough time. If you want to level up much quicker, going out into the wild and defeating monsters will teach you what you need at a much faster rate. This change means that there are much more 5th level wizards running around, and 2nd level spells are relatively common. 3rd level spells are castable by only 1% of the population, but that is still enough to have an impact. 

Now, I was initially going to write about how individual spells impact the world. /u/JimCasy, however, has already done that and has gotten all the way to Second Level spells as of the time of this post. [You can read about that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/al2boi/magic_of_the_second_level_spells_storytelling/). Rather than retread work that has already been done, today I would instead like to expand more upon how Dnd magic might influence the culture of the world. 

#Magic Nobility

So the first thing I want to go in-depth about is how magic would affect the nobility. In my previous post, I made the assumption that magic is genetic and random in nature, similar to the world of Harry Potter. This leads to a world where people who can cast magic will get married and have more magically gifted children than the average family, but the average family can still have a magically inclined child. 

Having magic is incredibly important to have as it gives you many skills that are simply impossible for others. The cantrip Mending is strong enough to be its own profession, and that's not even including the other spells such as Alarm, Comprehend Languages, and Create Water. These services are invaluable and make the Wizard a highly sought after individual. With such an exclusive and powerful skill set, it's no wonder that magicking individuals make their way into nobility. However, as great and powerful magic is, some less than ideal uses of it have tainted the public view of magic.

#Public Perception of Magic

As /u/JimCasy points out in his cantrips article, spells such as Friends can leave a very sour taste in the public eyes concerning spell casting. Why should people be allowed to walk around with powerful enchantment magic that can force you to do whatever they want? Well, when they are also giving you your water and can fix your things for coppers and silvers, the benefits outweigh the downsides. Spellcasters are treated with caution and fear, and even if it is an unjust stereotype, it only takes one casting of Charm Person to seriously ruin your life. 

With how manipulative the enchantment school can be, I would expect it to become outlawed in many societies. It would be mainly criminals who use this school in order to exploit others. However, given the correct environment, students of enchantment could flourish. For example, in one of my worlds, the Drow have intense political intrigue and it is perfectly normal to try to enchant your way through the upper classes. If someone fails their Wisdom save and hands their gold to you, did they really deserve it in the first place? 

#Thinking About Individual Spells

When considering the impact of spells on the world, it helps to think about individual spells and what they do to the surrounding culture. /u/JimCasy's previous articles are a huge help, but there is always more that can be thought about these spells. Another thing I like to consider is how spells can be modified to produce different results. In the largest city of my world, Tenser's Floating Disk has been modified so that it can go up and down instead of left and right. The people then use this spell to serve as an elevator for the mesa that the city is situated upon. Now, while this spell may be different from what is in the PHB, adding spells to situations that would normally not have spells can make the world feel much more magical. 

Most spells are really just shortcuts for things that we can already do. Mending is not impossible to do in real life, it just takes a lot more time. To indicate a higher magic location, have more spells doing the work. Sometimes though, spells can introduce elements that were previously not possible. Create Water can make living in the desert a possibility, where there was none before. In order to cast Create Water, you need to be religious creating a much more religious society in the desert. But what happens if the leading Cleric loses their faith, and can no longer cast this all-important spell? Adding little things like this all over the world can help to make something that is truly unique. 

#Conclusion

Magic is complicated and is something that should be heavily considered when designing a world. Building around magic creates a world that feels much more real, as opposed to a world where Dnd magic was added on as an afterthought. It is not easy to build a world this way, and what I have typed up today is only a small consideration of how magic might affect the world. What are some things you guys have done to make magic feel more like it's always been part of the world? Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,162,377,"Hey everyone, hope you’re staying warm. It’s bloody cold in Canada and leaving the house seems like a bad idea, so I’m yours for the day! 

I started playing D&amp;D second edition when I was probably twelve years old. The dad of one of my best friends got all of us pre-teen nerds together in their basement once a week and ran us through all kinds of shenanigans. I don’t remember a lot from them, other than claiming I rolled an 18/00 strength for my Paladin (no one called me out. Unbelievable), and Andrew crying when his dwarven fighter was killed by harpys. I figured he was too into the game, but I ended up crying when one of my PCs mercy killed her father a few months ago. Now who has the problem?

I then played some 3.5 with a family friend when I was around 15 or 16. 

Years of craving a game had me fruitlessly searching for a local game I could join as a player. After a long hunt I realized I’d need to run my own game if I wanted to play, so I got some friends together and spent a few months obsessively absorbing everything I could about being a DM. This sub, r/DMacademy, Matt Colville, Critical Roll, anything I could get my hands on.  I spent far too much time for a grown man with kids and a job should have spent reading about a game, but here we are. 

I started my first campaign in LMOP, transitioned to the world from the novel I’m working on, and a year later we’re going strong. 

I’ve learned a lot of lessons throughout this time, some harder than others. I’m hoping this AMA will teach me as much or more as anyone else here, I’m always trying to hone the craft. The more I do this, the more I realize I need work, so bring it on!

I should be here all day off and on, so let’s get to it!

Edit: Some things I’ve been learning lately, feel free to ask about these (or anything): 

 - Improvisation and customizing everything
 
- What to spend prep time on

 - Writing out descriptions and building modules

 - Focusing on the next session 

 - Planning for your players

- sticky notes!

EDIT 2: There are a ton of good resources out there, far too many to list. Any DND subreddit is amazing if you want help with this game, and check all the related subs in the community info tabs, there's gold out there! That being said, here are two of the resources I most love: 

1) u/famoushippopotamus (Whom I believe founded this sub) has produced a cornucopia of invaluable information. You can find it indexed nicely here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/agf4k7/the_complete_hippo_2019_update/

Thanks Hippo!

2) Here is an ebook that is free (but I'd recommend donating) full of delicious goodness. If you're a DM, you've got to read it!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,110,2476,"Hello! I've been lurking here for a little while now, stealing all of your ideas, so I thought I'd give a little something back.

&amp;#x200B;

I created these 50 taverns with a short description, hopefully to light a little spark in your imagination, be it for a quest or just a little thing to plop on the road.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rumble Inn**

Once every hour a bell tolls and the whole inn shakes. The patrons all seem aware that this is going to happen and don't bat an eyelid as unattended glasses fall to the floor and shatter. All tables, chairs and stools are bolted to the ground to stop them tumbling every time there's a rumble.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Salty Seafarer**

Found moored up at ports around the lands, this floating tavern is always busy, but only for a week or so before it sails off to it's next destination. Who knows when you'll bump into it again!  


Famed for the owner's stories and fables they have collected on their travels from the tavern's many patrons, as well as world famous bards who often travel along with it. Of course we can't forget to mention the exotic drinks and food they have picked up on the way!

&amp;#x200B;

**Nobody's Inn**

Entering this tavern, you find that there doesn't seem to be an owner, although there are many patrons, pouring their own drinks and leaving coins in collection trays.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Boney Bar**

The Boney bar is, if anything, creepier than it sounds. Not only are there skeletons serving you, nearly everything is made out of bones. The tables and chairs, a massive chandelier hanging in the centre of the room... even the mugs are skulls with the holes plugged up!  


Luckily, the food and drink is exquisite!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dapper Dragon**

A fancy restaurant that uses tiny dragons and other creatures to help cook food. Basically Ratatouille but with monsters!  


If I were you, unless you like your food black, I wouldn't ask for my steak to be ""Well done.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Hunter's Rest**

Situated in the head of a huge dragon, this extravagant tavern is a place for hunters to show off their kills and share stories of their hunts. They also hold competitions here, as well as hosting a market and trade shows for meats, furs and other materials extracted from their kills.  


Adorning the walls of the three floors are the heads of all sorts of beasts, ranging from stags and boar to more exotic creatures like Owlbears and Displacer Beasts. There is a leaderboard filled with the top 20 hunter's names and how many points they have for the season.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Weather House**

The weather inside this place is always different to what it is outside, offering respite if it is particularly hot or cold. Unfortunately the owners were not very specific with the wizard that they got to enchant their tavern, causing it to rain, snow or even hail inside when the weather outside is warm, which isn't great for business, although they do keep a few umbrellas by the front door, so you can stay mostly dry if you decide to stay here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tinsy Winsy Tavern**

Sandwiched between two large buildings is a small door leading to a tiny room with one stool in front of a short bar, leaving just enough room behind it for a halfling barkeep.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Drunken Dummy**

Every night the owner is on stage with his wooden ventriloquist dummy. This thing looks creepy as hell, but they are telling some great jokes and the crowd is eating it all up! The act seems to show they have a complicated relationship, with the dummy regularly shouting down the owner and slapping him. It's a fantastic routine... or so it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

**The King's Armistice**

This tavern has been untouched by many wars over the years. Said to have been blessed by a mighty wizards final words as he sacrificed himself to end a long and gory war, it is a place to go for some respite during warring times. Upon entering all equipment disappears, including clothing. No magic seems to work either.  


Of course upon exiting, many people instantly break any truce they previously had, making the surrounding area of this tavern a bit of a wreck.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tinker Inn**

As you push the door you hear a mechanical whirring. Looking up you see a clockwork soldier with a big hammer run out of a house and strike a bell, alerting the owner to a new visitor.  


Dotted around the tavern are all sorts of interesting toys and contraptions. Some are just for aesthetics, like a small hot air balloon flying around the room, but others are actually useful. Little trains run along tracks around the room delivering food and drinks and music is playing from a strange box at the back of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Nibbly Fish**

Opening the door you realise that nearly the whole floor is lowered and covered in a pool of water about a foot deep. A sign on the door says, ""No shoes!""  


You take your boots off and step inside, noticing there are tiny colourful goldfish swimming around and nibbling the dead skin off your feet. There's nothing like a free foot pedicure whilst you enjoy a good drink!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat's Whiskers**

Ran by a lovely Tabaxi family, this inn is full of cats of all different breeds. You'll find them napping on beams, weaving in and out of the patrons legs and mewing whilst they wait to be fed.  


It's a great place to visit if you like milk on tap! (But awful if you're allergic to cats)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Costumer's Always Right**

There is a bouncer at the door dressed up like a bugbear. He says, ""Hey, no coming in without a costume.""  


Once dressed up sufficiently you are let inside. You see people dressed up as famous heroes from stories and also as monsters, some of which are real and some are made up. They are all chatting and laughing, pretending to fight and posing for portraits.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gravity Falls Tavern**

Situated at the base of a waterfall that is actually flowing up the cliff instead of down it, the Gravity Falls Tavern is a sight to behold. It's upside down. Drunk people are exiting, stumbling around as they navigate the stone steps.  


Entering, you see a chandelier standing upright, 'hanging' from a chain set in the floor. The most amazing thing is that you see people walking and sitting on every single face of this room. Each side of the room seems to have it's own gravity field, including the bar, which is at 90 degrees to what you currently see as the floor. You realise that those people probably weren't drunk, just disorientated from dealing with all the changes in gravity!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Roasting Duck**

Every night is roast night here at The Roasting Duck! We're not just talking about the food either. Come on in for you and your friends to get a good ol' roasting from our in-house roasters and you can even get up on stage and give it a go. The best roaster every night wins 30gp! Do you have what it takes?

&amp;#x200B;

**Firebeard Tavern**

At the end of every night the magnificently bearded owner stands up on a table in the middle of the tavern to the cheers of the patrons and sets his beard on fire, keeping it going for as long as he can. During this time drinks are free so the patrons swig as much as they can before he has to pat it out. His record is 4 minutes!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tower**

Unlike any tavern you've seen before, this place is about 6 times taller than it is round! Apparently this place used to be connected to a massive castle, but it got destroyed in a great war. With a spiral staircase round the edge and a pole in the middle to slide down, this tavern is certainly a novelty. You notice all the staff members have incredibly strong calf muscles from walking up the steps so much.  


At the top of the tower is an open top terrace, offering an amazing view out across the surrounding valleys.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Grape Escape**

An underground winery that stretches for longer than any tavern you've seen before. Like a wine cellar, this place has thousands of bottles in racks and shelves that make up the walls. What sets this apart from other wine cellars is that it is also a maze! Without a guide you are sure to get lost in its winding walls.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Peace &amp; Quiet**

A haven for writers and readers alike, this is the quietest tavern/library you've ever seen. Although to be fair, it is the only tavern/library you've ever seen. With three floors of books, comfy seats and desks, this is a great place to relax, or even come for a quick nap... as long as you don't snore.  


If you're looking for a good book, this is the place to go. There are books on every wall, shelves upon shelves of ordered books and not to mention the staircases with books under every single step! You will be spoilt for choice!  


However, if you aren't keen on this scene you aren't going to have too much fun. There are alcoholic bevereges, but they are all cocktails themed around book names... (Tequila Mockingbird, Lord of the Gins, etc.) and there is a limit of one per customer to avoid anyone getting too loud.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Knife &amp; Pork**

With its very own in-house abattoir, feel free to select your favourite from a wide selection of pigs to chow down on this evening. It's the perfect place to be swined and dined!  


This place is really fancy and looks great from the outside. Everyone is dressed to the nines and are pretty posh. As soon as you enter you hear the squealing of pigs out the back. Likely to be a pretty harrowing experience for you and your party...

&amp;#x200B;

**The Amen Arms**

The Amen Arms is a multi-use building, being a church and also a bar. The only problem is that they only sell communion wine on tap. Unfortunately this has left the members of the clergy with pretty severe drinking problems, which does liven up Sunday prayers, but isn't so great when the priest is loudly weeping at funerals and weddings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rick Ade Bar**

This bar has some of the trippiest drinks you've ever seen! Fizzing potions and steaming cauldrons are on every table and everything is so cheap! As you've had your fill and you go to leave you realise the door has been barricaded and there is no way out. You're told that all the drinks need to go before anyone can leave.  


Looking around you see there are creatures like Bugbears and Gnolls as well as people of all different races (and classes) around the bar, some not looking overly thrilled that they have to spend the night in this place.  


You see a fight break out between two clerics, shouting ""Die demon scum! Go back to whence you came!""  


That's when you feel it start to kick in... What on earth is in these drinks?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Stray Fey Inn**

This beautiful inn originated from the Feywild. Due to an accident many years ago, this inn and all of its patrons got transported to your plane. Apparently this was a pretty rough area before the inn turned up and they attracted some higher class visitors. No one is quite sure what happened with the inn that was here before, but it is common legend that it was taken to the Feywild with its less-than-savoury patrons so they could try and redeem themselves in a different land.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Playhouse**

This grand theater has been converted into a dining establishment with live acts. Once a month the Queen visits and judges a talent competition, with the winner taking a spot in the Royal Talent Guild. Members of this guild go to live in the castle grounds, entertaining guests and earning a great salary before being kicked back out into the real world once the Queen has had enough of you. Past members all seem desperate to get back, but most of them fail.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Boar Inn**

This tavern seems really standard. Just a really old sweet couple who are like 90 years old. Offer tea and coffee and cakes rather than booze. There are those white lacy doilies on the tables and it's just proper classic old person vibe.  


However, you do notice a dull repetitive thudding through the floorboards. With some investigation you find a bright neon, seizure-inducing underground club. Everyone is covered in glow in the dark patterns. Drink and drugs are in high supply. If you decide to stay you're soon joined by the old couple who properly rave it up. They ask that you do not tell anyone else of their secret club because the nobles wouldn't approve it. In return you get half price food and drink, either upstairs or downstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twilight Tussle Inn**

Every night at sunset a huge brawl breaks out over the tavern. Once there are x people left, everyone that lost must buy them a drink at some point during the evening.  


(Replace 'x' with the party size -1 person.)  


Naturally, the owners have long since stopped buying new glasses, tending to just use stone mugs because they are so much harder to break. They have also had to bolt down all of the tables and chairs to stop them being used as weapons every night. other than that is is pretty much no holds barred, although there will be a severe penalty if you actually kill someone during the tussle.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Brushstroke Bed &amp; Breakfast**

The Brushstroke Bed &amp; Breakfast (BSB&amp;B for short) is an idyllic and luscious establishment with a very special hook. Each rooms door is replaced by a large enchanted painting that creates different scenes to sleep in. Ranging from snugly tropical treehouses and luxurious campsites in the woods to frozen igloos and rocking boats on the sea. This place is sure to have a room for anyone to enjoy... if they have the coin to afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fire and Ice Alehouse**

This tavern features dueling bars on opposite sides of the room. One side icy and blue tones the other billowing flames and red tones. The two sides come together across the ceiling every hour to make “fire water” that falls from a swirling cloud in the middle of the room. Fire Water is a delicious drink that also provides its drinker resistance to fire and ice for 24 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Toil &amp; Trouble**

Ran by a Neutral Witch, this place is filled with bad guys nearly 24/7. She doesn't seem to notice or care about anyone's alignments or what they get up to, unless there is any violence. If anyone causes a scene she descends on them, leaves them within an inch of their lives and bans them for life. If anyone tries to return, even in disguise, she knows and instantly kills them. She has no time for people that want to cause problems in her domain.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rickety Witch**

There aren't actually any witches in this bar, but the servers float around on brooms and are dressed up as them. The food is all themed around ingredients in potions. Rat tails, eyes of creatures, etc.  


Surprisingly tasty!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dark Horse**

This tavern is in complete darkness and any attempt to create a light either by magical or non-magical methods will fail. The staff all wear special goggles that allow them to see whilst serving tables and dealing with customers.  


It is billed as a unique experience to tantalise your senses, but in reality the owner is a once beautiful sorceress that has been horrifically disfigured by a curse and she hates being seen. She may employ the party to help lift the curse and in return offer them the tavern, which they can design however they wish.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bam &amp; Booze**

The best way to describe this place is... confusing. The first thing you need to do is figure out how to get in! The door doesn't seem to open in the normal way. Do you try and go through a window? Down the chimney? Maybe there's a key hidden somewhere?  


It gets even more confusing once you get inside. All of the drinks are FREE! (As long as you can solve the puzzles the owner puts before you. Some may be in a different room of the tavern, whereas others could be simple riddles.  


Now you've had your fill and are ready to leave, how do you get out? Uh oh. It's a huge escape room! (I feel like this one will be really fun to flesh out for a DM!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Oasis**

Stumbling through the desert you happen upon a large tent with camels tied up outside. Inside is a luxury bar with expensive drinks and attractive women. People are sitting around in beanbags, smoking who knows what from hookahs. Smells of delicious exotic foods are wafting through the air. It's very inviting.  


I'll let you DMs decide how real this place is! It could either be a mirage and not exist at all, a crappy little tent with horrible drinks under a major illusion or exactly as described. How evil are you feeling?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Meteorite Meat Shack**

Located at the bottom of a huge impact crater from a meteorite, this self sustaining tavern is attached to a huge farm. Apparently the soil in the bottom of the crater is particularly fertile, leading to stronger crops and livestock!  


If your players do some investigating they will find out that the meteorite is still around, with a barn built around it in the dead centre of the crater. Of course it is the source of the mysteriously good crops and livestock. All it needs is a human blood sacrifice once a week...

&amp;#x200B;

**Cheep &amp; Cheerful**

A tavern filled with colourful birds of all different species flying around and perching on beams above you. You can buy seeds to feed the birds if you are so inclined. (They are also less likely to try and eat your dinner if you feed them!)  


No Cats or Tabaxi allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hear Here!**

Live music, 24/7, featuring all your favourite artists and bands; Coldflay, Goblin Manuel Miranda, Armour Class/Difficulty Class,  Owlbear City, Bulette Zeppelin and more!  
(5gp entry)  


**Muscles &amp; Cockles**

The only restaurant where you can pump iron and pump beer, from a tap. The beer, not the iron. The stronger you are, the heavier your discount. Upon entering you must perform a feat of strength, such as hitting a button with a mallet to try and ding the bell at the top or lifting something heavy, like barrels of beer or a rotund gentleman.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Holey Grail**

Named after a grail that has been pierced hundreds of times, be it from arrows, explosions or a multitude of other things. Every night the tavern owners hold a contest to see who can create the most holes when it is tossed in the air. After 12 hours the grail has mysteriously repaired itself. (You could make this a magical item or simply have the owners replace it with a new one every day)

&amp;#x200B;

**Love Me Knot**

This tavern is placed right there on the beach. But, oh no, the tides coming in! Never fear, the Love Me Knot floats and is tied down to heavy anchors beneath the sea floor to stop it from drifting away. Of course it still seems to move around the beach every other week to find a nice spot in the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grogchamp**

Winner of finest Grog 3 years straight, you'd be hard pressed to find a finer drink. However, the brewer is letting all the fame get to his head and is getting rather arrogant, challenging all around to try and create a better beverage. Are your party up to the task?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Leeky Crockpot**

Everything is... leeky. Like, based on leeks. Leeks on your food, leeks used as stirrers in your drinks. There are even leeks on the beds! Where are all these leeks coming from? Now you smell like leeks. You scrub and you scrub, but still, the leeky reek remains. If your adventurers get a bed here for the night they take a charisma hit to all except those who love leeks, in which case they get a bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Troll Booth**

Simply pay your fee to cross the bridge and there surely won't be any trouble. They'll even throw in a hot cup of tea or coffee to make it worth your while. The trolls found that they were getting a lot higher return when they moved over to the service industry instead of the... ambush industry?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rise and Shine**

You arrive at the tavern after a hard day's dungeon diving, just to find it is shut. Looking at the opening hours you see it is open from 6AM-7AM. Who on earth is drinking at 6 in the morning??

&amp;#x200B;

If they go during open hour~~s~~ they find it is absolutely heaving with customers, drunkards stumbling out after being in there for just a few minutes. Whilst inside you notice time is so much slower too. It will feel like hours pass whilst inside, even if you're only in there for 10 minutes of real time. (Maximum 12 hours in the 1 hour it's open, so 10 minutes real time would be 2 hours drinking time, for example)

&amp;#x200B;

**Above Par**

Err, drinking and mini-golf? Yes please! A hole-in-one on the final hole wins you a free drink at the bar. Just be careful though, the more you drink, the harder it is to aim! (You may also refer to this place as ""The Golf Club"")

&amp;#x200B;

**Beat it**

As you enter you must play a tune on a drum kit. If you play it well everyone cheers, but if it's bad they will boo and jeer. If you refuse to play or roll a nat 1, you can't enter. If you roll a nat 20 you get a free beer or some other prize.

&amp;#x200B;

**Climber's Paradise**

The only thing between you and a cold glass of ale is this 100-foot climbing wall.

&amp;#x200B;

**Paradice**

Yes, Para*dice.* This club is so exclusive, you can only get in if you hit a DC20 Charisma check.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rambler's Gamble**

Among the hills and slopes of this region rests an inn. An inn owned by a being addicted to gambling. Any travelers passing by may be tempted to enter for a refreshing drink and a hot meal, but they will find no prices on the menu. Maybe they would like to wager something for it instead?

&amp;#x200B;

**Gob Site**

A wooden construct, stuck together with mud and held up with thin ropes, this absolute dive of a bar isn't somewhere you would choose to go, even in a pinch.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,50,66,"**Friendly Update:** About 50 entries so far. Users reaching from the USA to Japan, and from Australia to Norway. If entries keep up this speed we can expect about 100 by Sunday, which means I'll need until Tuesday to send all the e-mails out. Also, thank you all for the kind words!

Welcome to r/DnDBehindTheScreen's dice exchange.

To celebrate our community's 4th birthday the mod team is organizing a worldwide dice exchange. Think of it as a secret santa type event, but you already know what you'll be getting and it's exactly what most of us want - a new dice set.

# **How do I enter?**

Simple enough, just fill out **[this form](https://goo.gl/forms/G50Yd6TzyLbp5lrf1)**.

To enter you must have participated in this community in some manner before. You need to have submitted at least one post or comment before the 4th of February, 2019.
After all users have entered, we will somewhat randomly assign you a giftee to whom you will be sending a dice set.

# **How does it work?**

Why do I say *somewhat* randomly? Because we're sorting you by regions to reduce shipping costs. So for example, if you're from Germany we'll try to find you a giftee that is also from Germany. If we can't do that, we'll try to at least have him be from the EU. And if we can't do that, we can guarantee that he'll at least be from planet Earth.

You will know who you're sending a dice set to, but you won't know who you'll be receiving them from.

# **Can I buy new a new dice set instead?**

Buying a new dice set and having it sent to your giftee is also acceptable. I for one know that I will be sending one of my personal dice sets so that I can also write a note with a story the dice have caused in one of my games.

# **The price**

Unlike secret santa you won't have to worry about spending more than you're getting, since most dice sets cost about 10$ anyway. If you'd like to send a more expensive dice set (e.g. metal dice) to REALLY brighten up someone's day, that's great.

At the end the value doesn't come from the dice themselves, but from the fact that every time you will be using your new dice you'll be reminded of how amazing this community is.

---

# **Is my personal information safe with you?**

In the words of Lord Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone: ""*Your secret is safe with my indifference.*""

Your personal information will be used exclusively to organize this dice exchange. After the exchange we will be deleting the Google Form responses as well as the Excel export used to sort and randomize you. Your information will no longer be on anybody's computer.

Mostly because we don't care about it but somewhat also because we don't care about it but also because we don't want any legal issues, appreciate your trust and want you to feel safe.

For or EU users, here's the **[GDPR disclaimer](https://termsfeed.com/privacy-policy/075356c77ab6a27d0cdb79444276be2e)** you will be consenting to by submitting your information. We'd much appreciate if you also write ""*I consent to my personal information being used for the purpose of this dice exchange.*"" under the Comments and Wishes section of the Google Form.

# **What happens to cheaters?**

If you have not received a dice set within one month of addresses being assigned you can write to us at DnDBehindTheScreenMod@gmail.com. If we recognize that a user has received a dice set but not sent one within this timeframe we will ban them from our community and announce their Reddit username (NOT their real name) for them to be publicly [shamed](https://media1.tenor.com/images/92c9776381398a3d14f101202b86bf50/tenor.gif).

Be aware of the fact that this event is based on **trust**. There is a natural element of risk to it, however small it may be. The good part is that AT MOST you'll be losing about 10$ of value to brighten up somebody's day and DnD experience. By entering you consent that you are aware of this risk and are taking it willingly.

# Final thoughts

I personally believe in the community, will definitely be entering and eagerly waiting to send somebody my dice set. I hope that by splitting the community into regions we might even meet some new people to play Dungeons and Dragons with and maybe even become friends.",1,DnDBehindTheScreen Dice Exchange: Let us celebrate 4 years together!

    Somewhere on a rainy slop
    There lies the face of a giant
    Fall in love under his melancholy sky
    Listening to the coldest music
    And step into the eye

Inside the Giant's Eye
---
You are in the personified mind of the last giant. That means you gotta deal with all of his mental problems. His weird relationship with his mother and father. The jealousy of his sister. His sweating problem. His fear of being cold and dead inside. You have to face his early mornings, and his trouble with food. Amongst all of this is your own story...maybe you can bring peace to this mind in the process. 

Rumors of the Giant’s Eye
---
1. Save the demon, save the world *(false)* 
2. Demons are trapped by circles. Even if it's made of chalk *(mostly true)* 
3. If you marry a demon you gain its powers *(mostly true)* 
4. The dragon here is 20 years old, which means there's 20 diamond hearts inside her *(mostly true)* 
5. If you die here you wake up back in the Real World *(ha, you wish)* 
6. The only way to slay a demon is to craft a Zweihander from gems and whack em *(sadly true)* 
7. All dogs are friendly here *(eh, kinda true, kinda false)* 
8. If you bring a cat with you it will always lead to the Demon *(sure, that sounds good)* 
9. There's a record collection here that grants wishes *true)*

**Melancholy Clouds**

""Boo hoo,"" is all you hear. They say this and cry relentlessly upon you. SAVE vs. Engulfing Sadness. Those affected by Engulfing Sadness must lament their past mistakes every turn, as their bodies evaporate into clouds. Every round roll to see what evaporates and what it does. After six rounds you evaporate. The only way to counter this is with direct sunlight or large quantities of alcohol (a bottle a day) until you can be in direct sunlight.

1. Liver - Can no longer filter fluids, auto-fail saves versus liquids (poisons, more clouds, alcohol) 
2. Fingers - Can no longer hold things unless your feet are prehensile 
3. Iris - Can no longer see in color, you see the sadness in everyone and everything 
4. Spine - Can no longer support yourself, both physically, emotionally, and financially 
5. Will-to-live - Can no longer *not* try to end your own life. Sorry, mom. 
6. Mouth - Can no longer talk or receive food or beverage, nose breathing is also extra loud.

**Hungry Dogs**

Packs of starving dogs roam the area. There are 12 of them in total. There will always be 1 per party member when encountered. They probably got bigger since the last time you saw them as they grow larger with everything they eat...

**Anxious Society Mob**

ASM is an occurence, not a particular body of people. They are never the same and their numbers replenish and grow the longer you stay here. They know everything about you. Dig deep into your players backstories. Make shit up. Hit them where it might hurt? I don't know. You'll know what works.
 
When encountered, the mob is:
 
1. Reenacting a moment from childhood (10% chance of Mom) 
2. Pretending to be pilgrims 
3. Pretending to be soldiers 
4. Pretending to be you 
5. Burying their dead 
6. Staging a wedding 
7. Sunbathing 
8. Hiding in a pop-up town they built 
9. Farming 
10. Hiding nearby...watching 
11. Planting mines for the party 
12. Having a bake sale

**Slickbacks**

Always sweating. Stark naked. Wretched stench. These monstrosities plod across the ground begging for shade and a cool breeze. They are the size of school buses and their scrawny legs cannot support their own weight. 

**Coldeyes**

She's cool. A blue ghost of frost, with eyes of marble painted deep like space. Always smokes hand rolled cigarettes and lets her hair hang over her face.

Known Ways to Unthaw Your Blood 

1. Marry a Slickback 
2. Fly too close to the sun 
3. There's an artifact somewhere that can do it, probably 
4. Or...bring Coldeyes her Stuffed Shark. She doesn't know where she left it. She might even go on a date with you if you do. 

**Early Birds**

Gargantuan, joy-eating doves. They shine as bright as the sun, travel in packs, and are only quelled by the setting sun. There are d8 Early Birds when this encounter is rolled.

**Flash Mobs**

These terrors come like lightning. There one minute and gone the next. Warriors that blink in and out of time, striking with ferocity and fervor. When Encountered there are 2d6 warriors. Flash Mobs blink in at the start of their turn and blink out at the end of the next person's turn.

**Psychedelic Teenage Biker Gang**
---
They ride bikes of sequin and astral energy. Tormentors and do-gooders of the land. They squash people like you, who come to pilfer and spelunk. They are never fooled and rarely speak. They watch old films from hilltops and plot. Scheme. 

**Mona**

* Says nothing. Everyone thinks she's mute. 
* Doesn't say she likes chubby boys who write poetry. 
* Actively hides her beautiful voice.

**Stein**

* Says they're a boy and there's no way to prove them wrong 
* Doesn't say that they think all girls are weak and pathetic 
* Actively hides that they don't know what they are…

**Shelley**

* Says she loves monsters 
* Doesn't say that she is aroused by blood 
* Actively hides that she has a soft spot for flowers and rats

**Corp**

* Says he enjoys eating flesh, your flesh in particular 
* Doesn't say he's vegan 
* Actively hides that he wants to die

**Types of Serenity**
---
Beautiful babes. Nymphs of cold disinterest. But...if you draw their attention, get them to think twice about how pathetic you are, they grant you boons and help you out with gold for rent and stuff. There are three.

**Serenity of the Wastes**

* Says she's a historian, collecting facts and names and things. 
* Doesn't say that she's a witch, married to a puppet, giving her voodoo powers 
* Actively hides her collection of voodoo dolls, which she can dress up like you (or anyone) and control them/inflict harm on them 

**Serenity the Film**

* Says she's boooooooored 
* Doesn't say that she wears her dead girlfriend's clothes 
* Actively hides that she cries at night, alone 

**Serenity Now**

* Says you're too fat for her and are grossing her out 
* Doesn't say that she is jealous of you (if you're skinny) 
* Actively Hides that she is bulimic

**Mother**

A dragon of loose knitting and wool, constantly unraveling yet never ending. She cries when she's alone and hoards all the people who stumble into this strange place. Mother wanders looking for Sister, Most Beloved, lamenting about Father and missing her sweet baby boy. She's not hostile unless provoked or crying. If reunited with Sister, Most Beloved she will allow you to use her body as a portal in and out of this strange land. If reunited with Father and Sister, Most Beloved, she will turn into a cozy sweater with a big, gold star on it. It can grant one wish and makes the wearer immune to magic. 

**Father**

A vanishing giant head. It stays silent and flees from you, barely alive humans in its mouth, screaming. If you call its name it will stop. It's excited to see you. It speaks in your mind and it tells you a story. 

Story - effect* 

* Sad - you are debilitated by your own tears unless you can recall a memory of your own father, one of happiness 
* Funny - your body shakes violently with a laughing fit unless you tell a joke that gets some laughs 
* Soothing - you drift off to sleep unless you do something drastic to keep awake (tell them a simple slap won't do) 
* Anecdote - you age 1d10 years unless you tell an anecdote about your own father from your childhood

**if your character is an orphan or never had a father, Father will give you a floating head father of your own. It spits out 10gp every week and then disappears. It says ""I LOVE YOU, SON"" in a booming voice. It says nothing else.*

**Sister, Most-Beloved**

It's your actual sister. It's all of the parties sisters. They're all together and they're all hanging out. You maybe didn't even know you had a sister, but here she is now. Oh, your sister had died when you were younger? Well here she is. Alive and well.

**Horror**

They are a demon of GLUTTONY. They are gender fluid. They perch on things as a big, technicolor slug while outside the Cesspool. They have a very disgusting, rotting ring wrapped around a finger. They are always trying to get you to indulge. 

You can indulge to: 

* gain an advantage die 
* regain your hp 
* find safety from an encounter 
* regain years of life 
* get a +1 to a weapon 
* learn secrets 

Each time you do, mark an X on your character sheet in RED INK. Look at it and remember. DO NOT INDULGE AGAIN.

If you mark 3 X's on your character sheet, you lose your soul to Gluttony. You can keep playing your character, but you must indulge at any chance you get. Food and drink. Excess. This will kill you and I hope it was worth it.

**Adventures Inside the Giant's Eye**
---
Think of this as catharsis. The problems this Giant has can be universal, which makes them relatable. Your party members might feel certain ways about their relatives. Mother, father, sister. This place can bring them resolution to something personal. Or maybe they just want the wish that Mother's sweater can give. Or the dragon hearts...or the status of Demon Slayer. Either way, this place is a retreat and a danger. Only the strong of mind will escape whole.

Can ya believe it?! Really proud we made it to today, and I wanted to thank each and every one of you for bringing your best, everyday. This place is nothing without all of YOU, so thank you!

We are going to have some festivities this week, so please make sure you check the sub often and jump into the fun!

Love you guys, thanks for everything!",1,"Happy 4th Birthday, BTS!"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,27,66,"Ladies and Gentlemen of BTS. During a chat around the Gollicking, u/RexiconJesse and me came to an odd discovery. With literally worlds full of deities and divine influences, from all types, in all shapes, representing the craziest things. How come every one of those things, whatever principles a divine being incorporates, all their followers get to do the same odd thing: Turn and Destroy Undead? 

Your players pick a domain, get some awesome spells, get a domain power, but whatever your players do, they are stuck being put in a box for being a healer and, even weirder, somehow they always are a bane of the undead. All that potential, all those amazing things a cleric could stand for. It even is by far the most versatile class regarding lore and backstories. But it is wasted, or at least not fully used or living up to that potential.   
  
So we decided to give (y)our players a chance to get something more. We decided to redo the Turn Undead and Destroy Undead features for the existing domains, to actually fit their domains and religious aptitudes. To show you examples of what a full cleric truly could be, and, maybe more important, something to make your (own) religions spring to life in the hands of those at your table.   
  
But you know how this goes. Brains got out of hand, and from changing features, entirely new domains became a reality. We can beat around the bush some more, but it might be better to show you some potential new content to your games.

Significant attention was paid to balance. which should pose little to no problem when you want to adopt them for your players in your game (FYI: some might be slightly underpowered, but only slightly).

We sat on these a while, and we have two more we want to show to you in a short time frame: **Coin** and **Legend**.

Because of the warm reception some of my other systems have enjoyed, I humbly submit a system that I believe the RPG world is hurting for - a set of mechanics for pitting the sociopolitical machines in your world against one another in a meaningful and creative way. Faction creation is easy, and a Faction Battle takes about 20 minutes once you learn the system. It should fit cleanly into your prep and your campaign, no matter what setting or game you're playing. 

I've also compiled a list of suggested Assets in the Fantasy genre (for your D&amp;D, Pathfinder, Dungeon World, etc Campaign)

[Fantasy Echelon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYtToNFq4wNkAMgC9oCxJva2LmHQkPxmASQFQOhDNZw/edit?usp=sharing)

More Echelons for other genres (Scifi, Kids on Bikes, etc) will follow. I'm interested in adding a Ravnica Echelon if there's enough interest, to allow the beautifully designed Factions in that setting to move against one another organically. I know that my DM philosophy isn't totally aligned with the way D&amp;D does their settings, but I was surprised that there wasn't a system like mine included in the book.

I've already started work on an expanded Faction Wars system called ""Vicious Throes of the Tarrasque"", which will provide more variation, specific Asset moves and abilities, more Faction stats... something to address more intricacies of interfaction conflict. It will take a long time to complete, but I will post it here when it's finished.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,138,867,"Mimics are best known for imitating a treasure chest and luring greedy or unaware adventurers into their maw. But mimics are crafty shape changers, and the craftiest of them evolve to take on other forms.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Fallen Party:**

This type of mimic lacks the shape-changing abilities of its relatives. They take on the form of a mound of flesh and exposed pieces of bone. They cover themselves in the gear and equipment of their prior victims, appearing to be a pile of dead and decaying adventurers. When touched, the mimic’s signature sticky film keeps the curious adventurer’s hand stuck to it.

Once touched, the large mass rises up and slumps onto its pray. The sticky film helps dissolve the flesh of its prey, but the prey will suffocate before that happens.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rooftop Lurker:**

When climbing, finding a weatherworn ladder can make the difference between getting to the top and falling from exhaustion.

The main hunting grounds for these flying mimics are cliff sides and on the top of buildings within ruins. They either lay flat or take on a decorative form, such as a gargoyle. They unravel their tongue, which is easily mistaken for a rope ladder. The ladder is not sticky. Instead, the mimic uses the strength of its tongue to hold and crush prey. When it feels the weight of something climbing it, it rolls its tongue up into its oversized mouth and takes flight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mim-inn-ic:**

Some believe a mimic’s size directly relates to their level of intelligence. Dungeoneers cite the mim-inn-ic as the main inspiration for this theory.

These mimics grow so large they take on the appearance of a two-story building. They find a traveled road and place themselves next to it, mimicking an inn made of stone and mortar. They know common, allowing them to create a sign with the name of the inn.

Inside of the “inn,” tables, chairs, a bar, and a hearth (no fire) are the main decor. 2-4 owners and/or patrons are inside. The people can only speak common, regardless of the race they portray. In addition, they all wear clothing that covers their feet. This is because they are part of the mimic itself, and if the adventurers could see the NPCs feet, they would see they are attached to the “stone” floor. The tables and chairs are real.

When adventurers enter, the “people” ask to hear tales of glory and triumph or whatever will feed the adventurer’s egos. While the adventurers are distracted, the mim-inn-ic will slowly start burying itself, eventually blocking all the doors and windows so no one can escape.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,41,"A little over a year ago, I resolved to run an open world, homebrew campaign with 5e D&amp;D. It had been a few years before my previous attempt, and I had a lot more experience along with an excellent, stable group of players to utilize. One thing that I knew I needed to do though was change the reward structures of the game in order to suit the campaign, and my personal tastes.

After plenty of research, rumination, player feedback, and a year of iteration, [this is what I've landed on](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/r1mFIpj8XN). I'll put the text at the bottom of this post as well.

___________________________________________

The **XP** system is largely inspired by the simple approach found in *Dungeon Crawl Classics*: a median between the objective 7-step number crunching process of default XP rules, and the pure DM fiat of Milestone leveling. This method grants the players a plainly visible measure of their progress between levels, and enables the DM to assess the experienced difficulty of encounters *after* the fact in order to judge an appropriate XP reward on an easy 5 point scale. Admittedly, this forfeits the encounter-balancing benefits of the default rules, and lacks the pacing of milestones in published adventures. I don't utilize XP budgets or planned milestones, so handling XP in this fashion preserves the benefits that I *do* need while keeping the process simple.

**Goals** are really helping my campaign sing. It's very important for players to establish what it is *they* want to do when running an open world campaign. We've found that creating and sharing character goals helps us all understand the characters and their place in the setting much better. Any time the players lose their momentum, they can just look down at their sheet and be reminded of something they can work on, a direction they can push the game in. They're also a huge boon for my prep work as a DM because I know precisely what content to expand on in order to facilitate the story the players want to tell!

In games using the standard Inspiration rules, my players and I have found it difficult to remember the mechanic even exists. Because Goals are checked at beginning and end of each session, it ensures that we utilize Inspiration more consistently. I also find it easier to keep track of three actionable desires that are associated with other elements of my world, compared to more vague and subjective qualities like Ideals or Traits, especially since Goals can be altered in order to address what's going on in the campaign currently. Of course it also helps when players can spend their Inspiration *after* a bad roll, but that's a common house rule that I can hardly take credit for.

And that's it! Hopefully some of you find this useful, or at least intriguing. I'd love to field any questions or feedback, or hear stories about your own open world/sandbox games and difficulties getting players to drive their own boat!

__________________________________________________

**Experience Points**

*Each participating Player Character is awarded an amount of Experience Points (XP) between 1 and 5 for tackling adventurous tasks such as fighting deadly monsters, exploring dangerous locales, and navigating tense social situations. The amount of points awarded shall be proportional to the difficulty and magnitude of the task (relative to the party's level) and additionally informed by the potential negative consequences of the challenge.*

*XP may also be awarded upon reaching particular milestones along the path to completing a quest. Such events are often the discovery, preservation, or destruction of key information, objects, locations, or individuals.*

*Due to the linear nature of this system, DMs should consider multiplying the reward for characters that are less experienced than their fellows. A 50% boost closely emulates the XP curve of a traditional system, and lets characters ""catch up"" over time.*

*After a player character has accumulated the requisite experience points, they gain a level in one of their classes during their next long rest. The DM need only inform players how much experience they have gained when they take a long rest, but you may find it appropriate to review XP rewards at the end of each session, or even at the end of each encounter/scene in which experience was earned.*

(I won't punch in the whole graph here, but each level beyond the first few requires 25 XP)

**Inspiration**

*Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his/her personality traits, goals, or flaws. By highlighting these characteristics during play, you can earn bonus rolls to help pull through in a pivotal moment, or ensure that you achieve your Goals.*

**Gaining Inspiration**

*At the beginning of each session, players may set or change up to 3 personal Goals for their character. At the end of the session, characters who prepared for, worked toward, or accomplished a Goal during the session are granted Inspiration. During play, the DM may also grant a character Advantage on a roll representing a key effort made specifically in pursuit of a Goal.*

*Aside from Goals, playing up a character trait in a funny or dramatic way is a good way to earn Inspiration, as is suffering a drawback due to a character flaw.*

*You either have Inspiration or you don't -- you can't stockpile multiple ""inspirations"" for later use.*

**Goals**

Good Goals are:

* Unique to the character- tying in to their past, personality, abilities, or beliefs.

* Tied to the world- involving a certain place, faction, person, creature, or object.

* Actionable and specific- they have a solid verb and a clear requirement.

* Something one can prepare for, work toward, or accomplish in the forseeable future.

Example Goals:

* ""Bring vengeance to the chief of the Bone Saw Tribe.""

* ""Acquire the grimoire of Niol The Horrifying.""

* ""Share my dark secret with Bo over a stiff drink.""

* ""Gain membership in the Diggers Guild at their headquarters in Timberholde.""

**Using Inspiration**

*If you have Inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your Inspiration gives you advantage on that roll. You may also spend Inspiration after a roll is made. In this case, roll one d20 and use its result, disregarding previous rolls.*",1,One page simplified Experience Points and Goal-based Inspiration.
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,56,722,"In my game, the party has acquired the [Dream](https://open5e.com/spellcasting/spells_a-z/d/dream) spell. As a group they're quite creative, and I've come to realize that this oft-forgotten spell should be nearly as important as better-known worldbreakers like *Teleport*.

When discussing this, I will use ""messenger"" to refer to the person who has the spell cast upon them and ""recipient"" to refer to the person contacted (since this spell kind of has two targets).

# What does it do?

In short, it lets a caster send one person (messenger) into one other person's dream (recipient). There's no concentration, so this can be done with multiple people. The messenger doesn't benefit from sleeping, but the recipient does. While there the messenger can shape landscape and objects within the dream, but always ""appears"" to the recipient. The recipient wakes up with ""perfect"" memory of the dream.

Alternately, it can be used as a long-range mental attack, robbing the target of the benefit of a night's sleep (a ""long rest"") and doing a small but potent 3d6 psychic damage. We'll discuss this usage before moving on to more peaceful applications.

# Dream as an Assault

**You die in the Dream, you die in real life**

The most direct use of Dream to change the world is as a tool of slow, plodding violence. By targeting a recipient night after night, they can be denied sleep and slowly crippled with psychic damage, racking up exhaustion and eroding hit dice until they finally expire from exhaustion and psychic assault. For a typical leader (assumed to be a high level character) this would be a slow decline over many days or weeks. The target may not even realize they are under magical assault right away, attributing the damage to disease or lack of sleep.

This is horrible death, and once the assault begins protections are surprisingly limited.

**Defense through Obscurity**

The best defense against Dream is obscurity: both of the spell and the target.

This spell is known only by very powerful casters (level 9 and up), so despite how devastating it is, it is not readily accessible.

The target must ""be known to"" the caster (not the messenger). This seems like a major hurdle, since it's unlikely that Random McPowerfulwizard would have met whatever king or adventurer they want to target, but Dream itself can get around this: the wizard cast the spell on a minion who knows the intended target, target themselves instead, then go to sleep. At this point, the minion can show them memories of the intended recipient. The wizard now knows the intended recipient's appearance, mannerisms, name, and so on, which per [sage advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/05/16/is-it-possible-to-cast-dream-on-someone-youve-only-seen-via-magic/) seems to be enough to target them.

**Other Magic as Defense**

Spells such as ""Private Sanctum"" and ""Nondetection"" would seem like obvious defenses, but despite appearances *Dream* is actually an Illusion spell, not Divination, so these offer no protection from it. The humble *Tiny Hut* does offer some reasonably-accessible sanctuary, and makes for a sort of anti-dream fallout shelter, but requires the *Hut*'s caster to sleep in the same room as the recipient (a tall order for the court wizard and the king!).

Other than *Tiny Hut* there's *Mind Blank* which blocks ""telepathic communication"" (pretty clearly what's happening here), but that's an 8th-level spell and thus effectively out of reach for almost everyone.

A non-RAW but logical solution might also be to change the appearance or magical identity of the target, using something like *Polymorph* or *Mystic Aura.* A reasonable interpretation of Magical Aura is that it could cause the target to appear to be a creature of another type for the duration, making the target too ""different"" from the one known by the caster: *ex. the caster targets the human King Leopold. Due to* Magical Aura *King Leopold appears to be a small badger to the spell, which fails as a result.*

**Defense through Limitations**

In terms of limitations, the spell has essentially no range limit but does require them to be on the same plane of existence, and puts some strain on the caster and messenger even if the target is awake.

* A targeted recipient might sleep at odd and ever-changing hours, such as in the middle of the day. Any break in casting long enough for the caster or messenger to rest would also create a window for the recipient.
* The target must be on the same plane, that means spells such as Magnificent Mansion, while rare, would allow the target to rest. They could even be placed in a bag of holding with some sort of air supply.
* The messenger ""appears in the dream"". Even if they are made to look horrifying, the target meets them and remembers them perfectly. This opens the messenger up to counter-scrying and counter-magic.
* An extreme solution might be to use something like Reincarnate to change the target's appearance (possibly to an un-targetable elf!) or have them transformed into an Undead so they don't need to sleep at all!

# Communication and Planning

While this is obviously a purpose of the spell, it has some major benefits about *how it works* that are not as obvious.

**The target gets extra time.** While the caster needs to stay in a ""trancelike state"" that precludes sleep, the target benefits from their full night of rest if the spell is being used in non-lethal mode. This makes it a boon for any head of state, lawyer, inventor, spymaster, or other person who mostly works in their mind. They can work a full day, go to bed, work 8 more hours, and wake up rested! In their dreams they can hold war conferences, make plans, discuss tactics, or think about anything so long as their messenger is willing to put off their rest.

**You can communicate lots of stuff.** First, the messenger can ""shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images"" and the target ""remembers the dream perfectly upon waking"". This allows the messenger to show just about anything they have seen, knowing that the target will recall it with perfect clarity. A vision of enemy battle lines, the face of a target for other magic, a mystical sigil, or even their memories of an event that might be important! The possibilities here are huge for feeding information back to a central source. One might expect certain barons or nobles within a kingdom to be obligated to send information to their king in this way regularly.

**You can bring lots of people from different places.** The spell does not require concentration, and there's no limit on how many people can be in a recipient's dream at once! This is essentially a VR teleconference where the host has a perfect memory of everything that occurs. This is huge! Travel takes weeks or months and can be highly dangerous. If everyone who needs to meet has a court wizard capable of casting Dream, there's no need. They can simply appear in one person's head and conduct their business.

**It is safe.** Unlike *Teleport,* there is zero chance of being transported to the wrong castle, or of being blinked into a wall and exploding into a fine mist. Most people would consider this to be a major benefit.

**The messages are totally secure.** Unlike letters, couriers, birds, and other means of communication, one's dreams are very secure. There is nothing to intercept, and even the All-Powerful *Scry* would see only a sleeping person. The only reasonable attack is someone sitting in a dreamer's bedroom with *Detect Thoughts* to steal 1-minute snippets... but that's a far cry more difficult than just listening at a door or swiping a letter.

# How does this affect your world?

Given how useful and powerful this spell is, consider how this could play out in various cultures around your world.

Who has access to this incredibly powerful resource? Would prioritizing court wizards with this spell mean other areas of magical power get left by the wayside?

Who travels when they can *Dream*? Even having to put a wagon on the road might be a sign of magical weakness for a leader.

How do criminals and spies use this spell? No need for dead drops, couriers, or other means of calling home if your handler can just pop into your mind once a week.

Do the counts and barons of a nation spend their nights making reports to an overbearing king and their days bleary-eyed from exhaustion? What do they hire adventurers to do so they can get a proper night's sleep?

The assault by *Dream* is a slow one. This can be a ticking clock for the heroes to uncover and thwart an attacking wizard. Any delay raises the chance that the person they are trying to save dies... but as a DM you have room to fudge exactly how long this takes.

What sort of news makes it to these meetings? How does this change the economy and the flow of information around your world? Do any quests or adventures open up if the local noble learns about certain events instantly?

What's the protocol when an important functionary fails to appear in a scheduled Dream meeting? This could be a hook, an unexpected complication in the players' plan.

Can the king be drugged with coffee and a spy altered to appear as them by *Magical Aura,* allowing them to intercept communication meant for the king's mind only? What could anyone do after this occurs?

Do the dreamless Elves get cut out of various diplomacy (or learn the outcomes later than others) simply because they cannot be contacted and have to wait for the scheduled Monthly Dream Meeting of Kings? Would they have human emissaries for this purpose?

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,101,1034,"I believe the sea to be one of the most underdeveloped parts of most fantasy settings. D&amp;D has mermaids, kuo-toa and sea elves, but it never analyzes the implications of such races.

**Borders**

Under the sea there are kingdoms, just like on land, we all know that. 

But those kingdoms would want land of their own: the sea isn’t just one flat blue plane on your map, it has borders between various kingdoms, and ships may have to pay tolls to pass through, like on any land border, or they may not be allowed to cross at all in certain places.

We always depict sea kingdoms as single cities in the middle of nothing, but logically they should claim land, create villages, farm, mine and exploit the sea floor where possible.

You could see ships take strange routes to avoid hostile kingdoms or expensive tariffs or to not cross the path of an underwater army swimming to war.

A regular ship is helpless against underwater attacks: do captains hire fishmen sailors? They can fight monsters, find seafood more easily, they can fix the ship hull from below if it gets damaged. 

Perhaps the bottom of the ship is filled with water to begin with, to give them a place to live.

They may be the only way able to stop a band of kuo-toa from taking down your boat.

Or maybe ships are built in an entirely different way, to handle underwater threats.

**Shipwrecks** 

Sinking has a very different meaning, when the sea floor is speckled with cities and people: if you’re drowning, they can save you. If you shipwreck on an isolated island, it may not be so isolated. You could find underwater creatures that notice your accident and will bring you back home for a price.
 
There could be fish people investigative agencies that go look for boats that disappeared:  merchants may want their crew and cargo back before some kuo-toa steals them. Insurance companies can send someone to make sure the boat really sunk in a storm. Families can get their loved ones found, no matter where they are.

Robinson Crusoe is now a 10 pages long book.

But how do you shipwreck? Reefs aren’t as dangerous, because you can have extremely precise charts of the sea bottom, you could even have a fishperson spotter that swims in front of the boat in dangerous areas.

Would you even have a boat? They could be faster than any underwater creature, but you could also pay fishpeople merchants to carry things in a much safer way, ignoring storms and bad weather.

**Coastal cities**

Coastal towns IRL are safe and prosperous, with easy access to trade. But with sea kingdoms, all of a sudden they are on a border: does the mermaid king claim the land just off the shore? You may not be able to use any boat at all. 

 Land kingdoms would find it very hard to fight against fishpeople, but the fishes can very easily invade the land, undetected until they are very close.
Would coastal towns need walls or other defences inside the water? Would hiring fishmen mercenaries be common?  Maybe. Surely they wouldn’t leave themselves wide open to a potential sea-based attack.

They could become involved in fishmen politics, trying to get a friendly king to control that piece of the sea, or even fight to take ownership of some sea themselves so they can fish freely, and not have to pay a toll.

**But how do you fish?**

Fishpeople would make for extremely efficient fishermen, much better than human ones. Would boat-fishing simply disappear? What is its use when any merman can do it better? It’s not even fishing, more like “fish herding”. 

They would also have an easy time collecting crabs, pearls and coral. Do those materials become very common in coastal towns?

Crab fishing in Alaska is one of the deadliest jobs in the world, at the moment. What happens when you can pay manatee-men or walrus people to do it extremely safely and efficiently? You do. You have no reason to put humans in danger to do it.

Or maybe you don’t have those races, so you enslave mermen and force them to do it in near-freezing water where they can just barely survive. Freeing them could be an entire adventure on its own.

So now you have fish mercenaries, merchants and fishermen in town. Where do they live? It would make a lot of sense to have partially and entirely underwater buildings for fishermen. You could have entire quarters that are partially submerged, allowing the two races to mingle. Half-fish hybrids would probably be common.

And you can say “what about the classic fantasy racism?”, well as I said fish-people have the upper hand here, humans can’t fight back much. 

Fishpeople can blockade a city for potentially ever very easily, islands turn from one of the best strategical positions to deathtraps, so no king would be able to afford to be racist against them. It could be the opposite, and it’s humans, elves etc. that are considered inferiors.
Or maybe there is a conflict, and coastal cities are heavily fortified only on the water side. 

Exploration of faraway lands becomes a lot easier. 

**And what about rivers and lakes?**

There could be fishmen that control the trade through a river, or maybe they oppose it and find it very annoying. 

Lakes could have entire cities built inside, around and above them. The classic castle on the lake is now literally ON the lake, with underwater chambers for fish royalty, guards and merchants.

The princess goes to take a romantic boat ride? All of a sudden, it’s extremely dangerous: a kuo-toa assassin could attack, or a sea monster. You need underwater bodyguards. Underwater mags. Underwater rangers.

**Not all the sea is the same**

Especially in a fantasy world, you could have large swats of ocean that are not inhabited. Volcanoes, forests of sea plants and monsters are all options if you want your sea to not have anyone in it. 

You could have an underwater eruption cause mass migration, and now your kingdom has to deal with thousands of refugees that can just swim up to shore and walk inside. How do you deal with that?

**Five examples** 

**1**: The players are sailing, they hit a storm and go down. As he flails in the icy cold water, the player feels something grab him from the back and bring him up. He pops out of the water, gasping for hair, turn around, and two large, wet black eyes are staring at him.

“Well well, jackass. What now? Your boat just fell on our houses, how’re you gonna pay the damages?” says the fishman with an angry tone.
The player looks around, it seems the entire crew is in the same awkward situation. A group of rays appears and carries you to a nearby island where you see a dozen other fishmen are waiting.

**2**: You reach a village, and notice something odd: the locals are using bizarre weapons you’ve never seen before. Long, white coiled spears, large red shields with a spiral pattern. Yellow-ish claws shaped vaguely like axes and harpoons made of some green-black material.

The locals say a few years before, all of this simply washed upon the shore, together with thousands of sea-elves bodies. There must have been a large battle nearby. 
Players with a keen eye will notice there are heraldic symbols on some of those weapons, the owners may want them back.

**3**: You’ve finally collected the money to pay for your trip to Sassafrass island. You can’t understand why it’s so expensive when the trip is no more than 50 miles. The captain invites you to his cabin, where he has a map of the region.

You notice a red line starting from your current location, going south for 100 miles, then east for just as long, then north for 200 miles, then west and then down diagonally, making almost a large spiral before reaching Sassafrass island.

“The trip will take a few weeks” says the captain

When you ask for an explanation, he tells you that if you fancy going through the waters of Szoggar the disemboweler and sail over the cave of the demon-fish Koggara, you’re free to do it with your own boat. He’s gonna take the only route that doesn’t get him murdered. Probably. Szoggar has been on the move a lot, recently.

**4**: A new island has appeared, not far from the coast, after a volcanic eruption. On it, there are ancient ruins, that were built underwater aeons ago.

The king sends people to explore and loot them. The fishmen don’t want to, they say it’s their land and their temple.  The king replies they have a treaty, and everything above the water belongs to him. They say it wasn’t above the water two days before and may not stay for long, it doesn’t count.
Both sides want to hire the players to get to the temple first. 

**5**: The players just reached Port Nyanzaru, and everybody is in a tizzy: King Neptunian the third will visit in just a few days. He will need an escort to protect him when he’s outside the water.

 Some say yuan-ti assassins want him dead, hoping for a diplomatic crisis that will be the end of the city. Other say the assassins aren’t snakes, but worshippers of an evil sea god that wants to strike when the king is vulnerable.

Can the players protect him when he's as defenceless as a fish out of water? 
",1,Using the sea in a world with intelligent fish people
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,126,"In a lot of fantasy settings, the world is typically carved up into a variety of different kingdoms, who are typically ruled by, well, kings. Lots of countries feature one race predominantly. Usually there’s a bunch of different kingdoms run by humans, with a minority of other races in each one, a dwarf kingdom, and elven kingdom (nearly always located in a  forest). To boot, there’s likely one kingdom that’s larger than the rest, which is either the most dominant political entity or the setting’s “evil empire”. Individual cities and towns will have their own dukes and barons who are beholden to their respective kings in some capacity or another.

And… well, in many D&amp;D games, that’s where the political landscape if the world ends. And truth be told, in some campaigns there’s nothing wrong with that. If the campaign has your party romping through the Nine Hells to steal some McGuffin from the palace of Asmodeus, you might well not need a excruciatingly in depth geopolitics on the prime material planes. 

But I’ve always been fond of diving headlong into political intrigue, the politics of royal courts, etc. The games I run almost always have some political bent to them, the more the better mostly. So, in what (I hope) will be a series of posts, I’m going to bring up sorts of situations that occurred in history, and talk about how they can be used as adventure hooks to help spice up any campaigns you have centered on political intrigue. 

So, let's talk about Personal Unions. 

**What is a personal Union?**

A king dies. His son/eldest child inherits the throne. Normally, that's all well and good- but what happens when the king has no children? He only had a younger brother- but he’s dead too. But said younger brother did have a son… who happens to be married to the queen of a neighboring kingdom. 

That son is made king of kingdom A, who is married to the queen of  kingdom B.  Whoever inherits the throne from their parents will become the king of both kingdoms A and B. Two counties- who might well have been fierce rivals until recently, and almost certainly have varying religious customs, cultures, administrative apparatus, traditions, and what have you, are now ruled by the same person, should they be able to keep the amalgamation together. 

Whether coming about through intrigue, untimely deaths,  a series of “accidents”, or the turns of fortune, two monarchies can wind up being ruled by the same person. Yet at the same time, this is not a conquest- both countries remain legally distinct entities. One kingdom is not merely annexed into the other.

**So, what does this look like?**
The answer is something very complicated. Partisans of both territories will be greatly inclined to defend every single old privilege and power they can, without any regard for the well being of the new country. People who loved their nation’s independence will rankle against being ruled by a foreign ruler. Countless debates may arise over what nation ought to be contributing more to the royal treasury in taxes- if the new nation even has a unified royal treasury to begin with. And did I mention the paperwork?

The newfound king of two nations might find himself inclined to try and consolidate his power. He will face resistance. Whether working as agents of the crown, or against it, plenty of opportunities for political adventure. 

**The Culture Question**

The Common language in most DnD games makes life easier for the players, but in reality is a pretty absurd concept. Sure, some settings might have a Lingua Franca- but that would be something reserved for noble courts, not spoken by the average commoner. Now imagine you’re running an army where half of it’s members speak one language, and the other half speak a different one. It’s not impossible to do (its been done in real life, after all), but it certainly doesn’t make things any easier. 

Language, of course, is only one aspect of culture. What happens when one person leads two countries with two different state religions? When what is taboo in one culture is celebrated in another?

I’m not here to come up with a variety of local customs and whatnot- the goal of this guide is to help inspire you to have cases where those cultures are forced to be united, which can be the cause of many varieties of political tension. 


**Historical Examples**
If any of you are interested in basing some nation in your campaign off a Country created by personal Union, here are some examples you can look to. 

* The Kalmar Union: This was the Union of the Crowns of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. 

* The Iberian Union: Portugal and Spain were under the same crown for 60 or so years. In this time, their colonial empire covered nearly all of the new world. 

* Austria-Hungary: Possibly the greatest known example of this, the amount of various kingdoms and titles held by the Habsburg family was pretty absurd. It only was destroyed in 1918, little more than 100 years ago. However, this entire amalgamation was the result of a variety of personal unions, not just the merger of the crowns of Austria and Hungary 

* The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a state with a week monarch and powerful nobility that spanned a large swath of Europe, from the Baltic sea to the Black sea.

* The United Kingdom: The result of the merger between the formerly independent Scotland And England. Still exists today. 

**Some examples of plot hooks or setting pieces revolving around Personal Unions**

* The king of Veredil-Alrhine is a half elf- which is only fitting, as he rules what had been up until recently been two separate kingdoms, one of mostly humans and one of mostly elves. The royal family has been desperately trying to consolidate power for generations, but is constantly meant by intransigence from both sides.

* The Baroness of Rivingtell has, through a series of timely deaths, inherited the kingdom of Talrun. She has not yet been crowned, and it’s unclear if she has any wish to be. Some rumor that she’s planning on auctioning off the title of king to the highest bidder, a move of questionable legality. 

* Through a plague, the Baron of Duskmore has found himself to be next in line for the ruler-ship of the Duchy of Cottenbrook. Many rumors persist that the Baron practices forbidden magic and started the plague that wiped out many of his rivals to the throne of the duchy. Only one remaining family member stands in his way to claiming the title of duke- a young girl, who currently is the duchess of of Cottenbrook (although a regent currently rules in her name).

* Two neighboring countries rivals with each other recently came to peace. As part of the peace deals, a variety of noble marriages were made, one of which being the binding together of two noble houses who ruled fiefs on the border of each country. Now, one man is the rightful heir of both fiefs. The Marquis and Duke of Orengrad-Burgundia- or at least, what he’s calling “Orengrad-Burgundia” has now declared the lands under his control to be independent and sovereign from both countries their lands were once under., much to the chagrin of both empires his lands were once a part of. Rumor has it he’s seeking powerful mercenaries and diplomats to help him survive what might turn into an onslaught against him. 

* The new king of Svolk hates his new subjects. In his prior realms, he was able to rule as an absolute monarch. In Svolk, his power is severely checked by a parliament, which he’s desperately trying to run circles around but to little avail. He's stuck in the middle of a war with another empire seeking to annex territory from his first kingdom, and the people of Svolk don't seem particularly inclined to sacrifice either blood or treasure to contribute to the war effort of a foreign country. 
",1,Personal Unions and You: Adding a bit of Spice to Medieval Era-Esq Style Politics
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,43,"So, this past fall my sister and I decided to co-DM our very first group. As we were new to the whole DMing thing, and she and several of our players were new to D&amp;D, we wanted to work with a pre-made module. But at the same time we, and our players, wanted to adventure in Eberron, that content having just come out for 5th Edition. What to do? Why, make a whole bunch of extra work for ourselves and **convert** ***Lost Mine of Phandelver*** **to Eberron**!

What follows is the guide for how we did it, in case anyone else wants to follow in our footsteps. **The players will face a rogue member of the Aundarian Knights Arcane, discover why all the clockwork devices in town are malfunctioning, escape a giant mechanical boar, and finally meet a sentient airship that longs for the release of death.**

Posted here for you to use, adapt, or otherwise be inspired by. **I only ask that you do not use this to make money in any way.** If you'd like to use this in that way, perhaps as the basis for a streaming campaign, contact me via private message and I'm sure we can work something out.

Apologies for length, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible! I'll do my best to answer any questions.

\------

**WHAT YOU'LL NEED**

* *Lost Mine of Phandelver* adventure module (available as part of the [D&amp;D Starter Set](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset))
* *The Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron* (available [online](https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/source/37) wherever fine WoTC PDFs are sold)
* It probably wouldn't hurt to go digging around the various [Eberron wiki](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Eberron_Wiki) and [info pages](http://www.eberron5e.com/) found online, and/or purchase some of the 3rd and 4th edition sourcebooks on ebay, to help color things in if you're not familiar with Eberron lore
* A whole lot of sticky notes, or other means of tracking changes to the adventure-as-printed
* A sense of improvisational fun

\------

**GENERAL NOTES**

* This guide will necessarily contain **massive spoilers for the** ***Lost Mine of Phandelver*** **adventure module**. Do not read it if you're planning to play it as an adventurer before running it as a DM.
* As Eberron doesn't feature the traditional guilds (Harpers, Order of the Gauntlet, etc), many of the NPCs described as guild members were converted into members of the various Dragonmarked Houses of Khorvaire. Most of these Dragonmarks only manifest in specific races, so that means that some of the characters underwent some radical alterations.
* Wherever possible, making things feel a little more ""steampunk"" helps give the adventure that unique Eberron flavor. I'll highlight a few ideas and pieces of flair that we incorporated, but don't feel limited by those.
* For thematic reasons, **we moved the ""loss"" of the mine up to the start of the Last War,** roughly 100 years ago, instead of the 500+ described in the module. This works surprisingly well, as 100 years of total war is roughly equivalent of 500+ years of peace when you want stuff to get lost.
* The [map on page 5](https://www.facebook.com/dungeonsanddragons/photos/pb.73340321070.-2207520000.1406604560./10152463299821071/?type=3&amp;theater), rotated clockwise 90 degrees and with Lake Gallifar drawn in the empty area in the now-southeastern corner, lines up remarkably well to the northern half of [**the Eldeen Reaches**](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~jlwatts/images/Eldeen%20Reaches%20(reduced).gif)**, where our adventure is now set.** Obviously some locations and landmarks need to be added, and others need to be erased for being too famously Faerunish (it's definitely weird to imagine the town of Neverwinter in Eberron!). If there's interest and it's not too much of an infringement (mods?), I'll post the map we created in a comment. You can also print out that map of the Eldeen Reaches and add the various towns and locations to that, if you prefer; Phandalin takes the place of either Alvirad or Mossmantle, with Wave Echo Cave being in the Icehorn Mountains.
* This conversion was done session-by-session, taking into account the players' actions and our own seat-of-the-pants decisions. As such, it's more of a ""draft"" than a fully pre-planned document.

\------

**ADVENTURE HOOK**

We decided to let the players design their own Eberron-specific characters instead of using the pre-gens. The only guidance we gave them was that these were all Aundarians who had decided, for whatever reason, **to join up with the Aundarian military** and had been earmarked for a ""special mission"". The players ended up creating:

* a grizzled army vet with PTSD and rage issues (human barbarian, soldier background)
* an old farmer tired of the quiet life on the farm, and in search of his son, who joined up with the military during the war and went missing (human paladin, homebrew ""[farmer](http://www.eberron5e.com/creating-a-character/customization/background/farmer)"" background)
* an eager blacksmith's apprentice who's lied about his very young age to join up and seek glory (halfling fighter, artisan background)
* a just-graduated war mage from a fallen noble house (human wizard, noble)
* a bartender-turned-spy-turned-""join the army if you don't want to be executed for treason"" ""volunteer"" (Dragonmarked halfling bard, House Ghallanda agent), and
* a warforged created for a non-war purpose, trying to discover just what that purpose is (warforged bard, sage)
* Yes, two bards. I don't know what to tell you, friends.

It is a beautiful autumn day in **Fairhaven, capital of Aundair, two years after the end of the Last War**. At the staging area for new recruits, **Sgt Sildar Hallwinter** of the **Aundarian Knights Arcane** pulls the party aside one-by-one and ushers them into a small room. There, accompanied by a very excited dwarf, **Gundren Rockseeker** (who Hallwinter has to keep shushing), he orders the characters to deliver some supplies to Aundarian contacts in Phandalin, a small backwater town in the heart of the **Eldeen Reaches.** As the Reaches are former Aundarian territory, but independent since the end of the War, the characters are not to wear their new uniforms. This seems like a strange order, and the presence of the clearly non-military and overeager Gundren is quite odd, but Hallwinter is still their commander and they must obey his orders.

&gt;NOTE: The players don't need to be Aundairian military for this adventure to work; it's just what we did because we wanted to set up some future adventures that seem to fit best with that country. The hook in the book works pretty well too if you'd prefer they are just hired by Gundren as muscle. But if you go that route, Hallwinter should still be an undercover member of the Knights Arcane, pursuing Aundarian interests, either known or unknown to Gundren.

At one point during the long overland trip from Fairhaven to Phandalin, Gundren and Hallwinter ride ahead to scout the road.

\------

**PART 1: GOBLIN ARROWS**

This part plays out more or less exactly as written. The players find the ambush site and empty map case, then trace the tracks back to Cragmaw Cave, where they beat up some goblins, free some wolves, and discover that Gundren has been sent on to Castle Cragmaw.

Upon rescuing the badly-wounded Hallwinter, the characters are told that they have been proven worthy by their heroic actions, and in any case will need to carry out the rest of the mission themselves because he is badly injured and will need time to recover. Hallwinter whispers a secret word to an otherwise blank sheet of paper that he has been carrying, causing the players' true orders to appear:

&gt;*Attn: Sgt. Sildar Hallwinter*  
&gt;  
&gt;*As per previous instruction, you are to select* ***SIX*** *specially-qualified soldiers for Project Echo.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*They will maintain Civilian appearance.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Your squad will recover the Forge of Phandelver, assisted by Gundren Rockseeker &amp; Rockseeker brothers.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Your squad will identify areas of allyship and distrust within Phandalin &amp; surrounding Region, citing specific individuals who are Supportive or Highly Unsupportive of Aundarian interests.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Should you be captured or killed, the Aundarian Crown will disavow you, your Squad, and this Mission.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*These orders have received the standard charms.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dario Ir'LainCmdr, Knights Arcane*

In retrospect, we should written ""*rediscover the location of*"" rather than ""*recover*"" as the players took this to mean that *they should physically try to remove the Forge from the cave*. Live and learn.

We wrote the orders on some off-white paper, complete with Aundarian Raven seal, Odd Capitalization, and calligraphic touches, which we handed to the players. **Providing tactile materials like this really helps players get into the story, and is a good practice for all DMs, regardless of the adventure!**

(Had Hallwinter been killed, the players would discover these orders on his person; the ""charms"" would then be that the words should appear only to his squad upon his death.)

The players having read the orders, the words disappear and the order sheet self-immolates (though we let the players take a photo to help them remember).

The players then continue on to Phandalin, where Hallwinter can recover from his wounds at the Stonehill Inn. This is a good spot to bring them up to Level 2.

\------

**PART 2: PHANDALIN**

As the main hub of the module, this section received the largest number of tweaks and adjustments. In particular, wherever we could incorporate **clockwork machines** into the daily life of the town, we did so: **complex brewing machines as well as food-serving conveyor belts at the Stonehill Inn, automated apple pickers at the orchard, ore-sorting machines at the Miner's Exchange, etc.** The locals complain that **these machines often spontaneously break and then fix themselves**, especially during the **spring**, but they've been malfunctioning a great deal over the past few days and weeks, which is very strange and out-of season. Players who try to determine if there's magical interference discover a **dampening field affecting clockwork-based machines** whose power ebbs and flows, seemingly at random. With good Investigation or Arcana rolls, they are able to repair some of the machines, much to the delight and occasional monetary reward of the townsfolk. Any warforged player characters are sufficiently advanced that they can deal with the problem themselves, unless you want to be mean and have the field interfere with their functioning at inopportune moments.

Additionally, and inexplicably to the players, whenever the warforged character introduces herself to older characters, she is asked **where her hat is** (they just thought a warforged would have a hat, for some reason?). They also expect her to be **taller**. Most NPCs are *very* scared of her.

The town in general appears to have two kinds of structures: older ones that are exceedingly well-built, with perfectly-fitted stones, generally around the center of town, and newer constructions that are much more slapped-together, usually built on and around the remains of some well-built building. Additionally, the machines seem far too grand for the meager number of people they are serving, and in fact many aren't being used at all even if they aren't broken. These facts reflect the lost size and greatness of the town, and hint at its being the product of **machine-assisted construction and operation** in is heyday before the War.

Per their orders, the players may inquire of all NPCs what their opinions of Aundair might be, hopefully keeping a low profile as they do so. This is to set up possible future adventures where the NPCs that have been identified as threats are being taken out by Aundair, which (once the Forge has been rediscovered) has designs on re-occupying the area and/or installing a friendly puppet government. If they are too obvious about their questions, you may decide to have some of the locals get together and try to run them out of town for being Aundairian spies.

The NPCs that we altered, along with their attitudes towards Aundair:

* **Toblen d'Ghallanda** (proprietor of the Stonehill Inn, **replaces Toblen Stonehill**): a halfling, neutral, entrepreneurial -- anyone who's got money to spend is fine by him. He otherwise tries to stay out of politics, as it's bad for business. Least Dragonmark of Hospitality on his hand. He was especially eager to catch up with his distant cousin in the party, and share the local scuttlebutt with her.
* **Trilene d'Ghallanda** (Toblen's wife): also a halfling, much more politically outspoken, and not a fan of Aundair.
* **Narth**, the farmer: pretty beat down. Angry at Aundair, which ""requisitioned"" (stole) his crops for its troops during the War.
* **Lanar:** revealed to be a big fan of Aundair when the characters got drunk after defeating the Redbrands and sang a patriotic Aundarian song at the inn, Nazis-in-*Casablanca*\-style.
* **Elmar Barthen:** pro-Aundair, wants to reclaim Phandalin's past glory by reconnecting it with wealthy trading partners in Fairhaven, perhaps even re-opening the fabled Forge of Phandelver (he was drinking with Gundren, who talks far too much, before the dwarf headed to Fairhaven to enlist Aundarian assistance). Barthen's Provisions specializes in things like oil, wrenches, and spare gears. Nothing impressive, but enough basic equipment to maintain the local machinery.
* **Daran d'Medani** (**replaces Daran Edermath**), a Half-Elf with a Lesser Dragonmark of Detection. He's a somewhat famous ex-PI who spent many years in Sharn and has retired here to run a small orchard. Though old, he missed Phandalin's heyday and is a bit cagey about the Forge, saying ""*if someone had told me everything I needed right at the start, I never would have learned anything. But you're on the right track.*"" Now he just wants a quiet retirement. He has a low opinion of any government -- Aundair, the Eldeen Reaches, even the united kingdom from before the War. From his perspective, they're *all* short-lived, and none impress him very much. He cares about taking care of *people*. He also notes how nice the players' weapons are -- why are they here, anyway? His apple picker and apple press machines are malfunctioning, but he's blasé about it (they'll work again soon enough) unless the players mention that ALL the machines in town are breaking down, which he finds ""intriguing"" given the season. His side-quest for the players is the same as in the book. He is also a possible adventure hook for future stories, should the DM wish to send the players on some noir-ish adventures, especially in Sharn.
* **Linene Graywind** (owner of the Lionshield Coster): she's bitter about Aundair (""*they said they'd keep us safe, they left us to rot. Now we have bandits. At least the Eldeen Reach Government doesn't pretend to care about us.*""). If the players reveal that they have found her provisions in the cave and are themselves from Aundair, she begrudgingly pays them but tells them to get out of her store. The Lionshield Coster is a local affiliate of House Orien.
* **Halia Thornton** (Phandalin Miner's Exchange). She looks really spry. A secret Lesser Mark of Passage is hidden somewhere on her body, though she is not actually a member of House Orien. She's reticent to reveal any kind of political inclination or partisanship (secretly, she's hostile to them all because she wants to run things herself, but the understanding between the Redbrands and the mayor has prevented her from being able to take over). She's having an especially bad day because her ore-sorting machines are all breaking down and the Redbrand ruffians keep interfering with her few customers, miners who come in from the mountains.
* **Sister Garaele** (at the **Shrine of Knowledge**, rather than Luck) is an elven cleric of **House Phiarlan.** She's suspicious of the powerful and oppressive aristocrats of Aundair, much preferring the new Eldeen Reach government because it's a grassroots movement. Her side-quest involves the players seeking out **ELIZA**, an information elemental, who can be bribed with an exceedingly elegant metal gear that Garaele gives the players.
* **Sildar Hallwinter**, once he's recovered, would like the players to see if they can't find out what happened to his buddy from the Knights Arcane, **Iarno Hallbrek**, who came to this area shortly after the end of the war, but hasn't reported in for some time. He fears the worst but would appreciate any information the players can gather.

One final minor alteration: the inn where the Redbrand Ruffians hang out is called the **Sleeping Golem**. #flavor!

**TRESENDAR MANOR**

The Tresendar noble family, based in Phandalin, died out during the War. Their heraldry shows a sword through a clockwork gear on a crimson field, which is reflected on some of the faded red tapestries scattered throughout the abandoned Manor. Other features that we added:

* Several of the stained glass windows on the ground floor appear to have been smashed, but there's no glass on the ground nearby (see below).
* Gas lamps throughout the older, pre-Redbrand parts of the basement are set to a timing device to self-activate at sundown, along with a gauge that indicates when it's time to refill the gas -- the needle reads ""empty"" and has been that way for a very long time.
* Escalator stairs lead to the basement (rats have chewed through the belts, making them just regular stairs).
* Broken stained glass shards are scattered in the hallway leading to the area where the prisoners are being held. The prisoners have had their shoes taken from them. (This is [a real thing](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/sns-portland-tunnels-story.html) that was done to keep ""Shanghaied"" abductees from escaping. It also makes for a fun sort of justice when the players take any surrendering Redbrand guards' boots and tell them to ""walk away"").
* The common room (Area 10) has a construct in the corner, long out of use. It has knight's armor but a finely articulated, outstretched arm (if he was working, he'd take your coat at parties). He used to be on a track on the main floor, but has been dragged down here to serve as a sort of comedic mascot. The Redbrands have thrown a red cloak over him. His metal head includes a jaunty bowler hat.

Finally, the players investigating ""Glassstaff""'s notes will discover that he is actually Iarno Halbeck, who is **a former member of the Knights Arcane** who was sent here some time ago to try to shift public opinion towards Aundair. Instead, he went rogue, hired some local muscle, intimidated the mayor into submission, and basically took over the town. He's since been searching, unsuccessfully, for the Forge, and has been in league with the Black Spider.

The letter from The Black Spider is just as it is in the book, except instead of having spies in Neverwinter, he has them in **Fairhaven**.

After defeating the Redbrand Ruffians, the players can level up again.

\------

**PART 3: THE SPIDER'S WEB**

We skipped the ""wilderness encounters"" because our players were more interested in story than combat. You can do that, keep them as-is, or consider more Eberron-specific threats such as bands of Druidic Orcs, Warforged that have been driven insane by the local power fluctuations, etc.

Our players bee-lined to Cragmaw Castle to rescue Gundren, skipping all the side-quests, because *of course they did.* To spread things out and help them explore more of the module, we had Gundren run off in excitement while they were taking a long rest, taking the map with him (he left a quickly-scrawled note thanking the party for the ""ress-q"" and encouraging them to meet him at the cave; clearly in his excitement he didn't consider that *he had taken the only map*).

**ELIZA (AGATHA)'S LAIR**

Eliza is an **Information Elemental** (a being we made up but whose purpose is right there in the name) bound to a wall that's similar to those ""pin art"" toys -- you know, the kind where [you put your hand or face against a bunch of pins](https://sensoryuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1093_jumbopinart-wr.gif) held between sheets of plastic, and they stick out to form a 3D copy? Imagine that, but a face in motion, and you get Eliza (she's named for the chatbot, of course). We played [this music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) when the players entered her lair.

Eliza was bound to this place by the authorities back when the area was much more frequently traveled, to serve as an info booth for travelers. In the years since the fall of the mine, she's grown bored, because nobody comes by to ask her anything anymore, but she's still stuck here. She's apolitical.

She's otherwise mostly the same as Agatha the Banshee, and can provide similar information to the players on a Persuasion check or in exchange for that gear from Sister Garaele.

After telling the players where Bowgentle's spellbook could be found, Eliza was glad enough for the company that she spat out **a map of the area** (see the General Note, above), and told them that three pieces of information would tell them how to find what they were truly looking for (""**three facts will find you three dwarves**""). Each of the other side-quests in this chapter will reveal one of the following clues in succession, in whichever order the players tackle them:

1. Wave Echo Cave is near a waterfall (we added lots of rivers and waterfalls to the map, so by itself this doesn't much narrow things down),
2. The Triboar Trail separates it from the morning sun, and
3. The cave's entrance is said to be blanketed in the Traitor's Blossom, a flower whose petals look like drops of blood with a long, feathered pistil.  Nobody knows why it's called that, but the salient fact is that it only grows within direct sight of Phandalin.

The players can also ask Daran d'Medani back in Phandalin for a tip. He will tell them one of the clues, meaning they only need to do two of the three sidequests.

With these three pieces of information, the players are able to use the area map to figure out the location of Wave Echo Cave: **near a waterfall, west of the Triboar trail** (which, remember, runs north-south once the map is rotated), **and within sight of Phandalin.** We made sure that **only one location on the map fit all three of these criteria.**

&gt;SIDENOTE: The Traitor's Blossom is so named because we had done a one-off ""[Quantum Leap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjK9GJMBpt0)"" session on a day when two of our players were absent, and we didn't want to advance the main plot without them. So the players found themselves in similar roles 100 years ago, as a squad defending Wave Echo Cave against a Karrnathi strike force in the opening days or weeks of the War (dream-time is odd). They went into town, which was bustling for the spring festival, providing a nice contrast to its modern, tumbledown state. The party's halfling boy charmed and danced with a local girl, much to his delight. They purchased supplies to defend the garrison, and fought off a small Karrnathi recon party that was skulking around the town. Upon returning to the cave, they were soon attacked by ever-increasing squads of soldiers and war-mages. These were led there by that same local girl, serving as an informant! As the party was all killed in combat (as we had set them up to be), the halfling with his last action shot an arrow in her chest, whispering ""*death to traitors*."" It's fun to reward great RP like that and weave it into the story. Also during this flashback, the players accidentally burned down Tresendar Manor. Time shenanigans!

**OLD OWL WELL**

This area is exactly as written, except that Kost's tattoos mark him as a denizen of the nearby **Demon Wastes** rather than  Thay, which is a Faerun location. If the players will leave him alone, he'll tell them one of the clues (or, if they kill him, they find it scrawled amongst his notes).

**THUNDERTREE**

Thundertree was ruined and corrupted by the magical experiments being conducted in the cave, which is upwind/upmountain from the town.  A few adjustments:

* This area isn't plagued by a dragon, but rather by a huge mechanical steam-powered boar, called **Belch.** This represents an early attempt by Phandelver at creating artificial life, but it broke free from the Cave and has been running around the ruins and surrounding woods ever since.
* **Reidoth is an orc**, a member of the **Wardens of the Wood**. He'd like the players to remove Belch, who is unnatural and an affront against nature. He is extremely anti-Aundair, because he blames them for interfering with the natural order of things. We played Reidoth as curt and grumpy, but in a kind of charming ""crotchety uncle"" way.
* The town square has not a statue of some rando soldier, but a mechanical creation resembling a warforged prototype, with a horn held aloft. A plaque calls him **The Sentry**, and a History check will cause educated characters to recall that many years ago, a construct had been set on the path into town to blow the horn as a warning in case of attack. However, when the attack came, *of his own volition*, the construct not only blew the warning but subsequently held the pass alone against the attackers, until the town guard could be properly assembled. In this way, he sacrificed himself to save the town, and also demonstrated that constructs could exceed the limits of their programming. The townsfolk gathered the pieces of the construct, now dead, and reassembled them as a statue in the square. The horn is definitely a treasure that the players can take, but we didn't decide what it might do. (feel free to make a suggestion in the comments!)
* The ""Dragon Cultists"" are actually **Warforged Cultists**. They have grafted metal onto their skin in an attempt to be more like their god, Belch the Boar. We mostly played these cultists as pretty pathetic, but you could make them sinister, if you like.

Either the Cultists, or Reidoth, or both if you're feeling generous or just want to move things along, will tell the players a clue pointing them to Wave Echo Cave.

**WYVERN TOR**

Like many orcs in Eberron, the orcs camped here are druids, and are attacking people so that nature can reclaim the area and undo the damage done by the unnatural experiments conducted at the Cave. In explaining their motives, they will reveal one of the clues. The players can then fight them, or convince them that they are also seeking to restore the area's natural balance.

**CRAGMAW CASTLE**

Like Tresendar Manor, Cragmaw Castle used to be home to a local noble family made wealthy by the clockwork creations being developed in the area.

* In the Banquet Hall (Area 7), characters can observe tracks on the floor and broken **automata** in servant's clothes; these would have taken orders and brought food around to guests -- they are thus more advanced than the mascot in Tresendar Manor, though still far less than sentient.
* Additionally, a string quartet stands in a corner, their instruments long ago having rusted or rotted away. Two wear hats, but Yegg has stolen the nicest one from the cellist, and wears it himself as a mark of his rank.
* The carvings in the Dark Hall (Area 8) show the three dragons of Eberron, and humans.
* The Goblin Shrine (Area 9) is for the Keeper, a god of death in Eberron religious beliefs.
* Vyerith is a Changeling rather than a Doppleganger. Her stats remain the same as the Doppleganger in the book.

Distribute your leveling based on how much progress the players make. Hopefully they are mostly at Level 4 by the time they get to the cave.

\------

**PART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE**

Because in our version, Gundren had run off ahead of the players, they discover him sobbing at the mouth of the cave, having found the body of his brother and sure that his other brother Nundro (who is missing) has also been killed. As befits a dwarven funeral, Gundren is very, very drunk. The characters continue on without him.

We printed out the map found on page 43, cutting it up between the areas and handing each piece as the players explored. This let the players discover the cave slowly, instead of seeing the whole thing from the start, which ruins the suspense.

* Instead of humans and dwarves vs. orcs, we described the corpses scattered throughout the cave as wearing either **Karnnathi or Aundarian uniforms**.
* Additionally, Aundarian flags, pneumatic message tubes powered by steam from the underground river, clockwork measuring tools in various quarters, and long-since crashed floating lanterns in common areas helped give this place a proper Eberron flavor.
* The players hadn't discovered the string quartet in Cragmaw Castle, so we moved them to the Great Cavern (Area 9).
* The hero in the Dark Pool (Area 10) was **Cinderblaze**, a fiery proto-warforged who died holding the line against the the Karnnathi. He wielded a **+1 Greatsword** that the players can recover instead of the wand (the wizard already has Glasstaff's staff; no need to give him another toy). If they skip this area, you can move Cinderblaze to the Warforged Display in Area 15+16.
* The Treasure Map in Area 14 refers to ""**Sena Shanti Research Facility**"", with notes about airships, diagrams of precision-tool automata (far more dextrous than any the players have ever encountered), and many references to further research locations in Breland. On a History check, characters will recall that Sena Shanti was an automata researcher who disappeared early in the war. This is a possible future adventure hook.
* Area 15+16: We thought that after all the many sessions of buildup, finding a room with a big torch in it was hardly a suitably epic finale (I believe our words on reading about this area were ""*that's it?!*""). Conclusion? **SENTIENT AIRSHIP.** This is actually the true prize of the Lost Mine.

The airship, the **SS Kingmaker,** is clearly designed for battle rather than the jaunty airborne transport of goods. It sports four ballistae on tracks (allowing them to be brought to bear on either the port or starboard), heavy armor plating, locations for additional wands of power and [docents](https://dnd4.fandom.com/wiki/Docent), and a screaming raven figurehead on its bow. It is the master creation of **Phandelver**, an Aundarian wizard working 100 years ago with agents of House Cannith to try to create artificial life. Although House Cannith would eventually adapt this work and use it to create the Warforged, selling them to all the nations at war, Phandelver was a patriot and intended for his airship to be used by Aundair to win the Last War before it even started. Unfortunately, the cave fell and the entrance collapsed when the Karnnathi attacked, and the Kingmaker has been trapped in this hall (which is much larger than in the book) ever since. A **rope bridge** connects the Kingmaker to the cave floor. Beneath the floating airship is a sheer drop into a bottomless abyss, which acts as a natural amplifier of the sounds of the water running through the room.

A few other items of interest in this area:

* A giant **golden water wheel** sits by the Forge, powered by the river flowing through the cavern. The water wheel is jammed with stones and other debris that the players can fairly easily dislodge.
* Six **switches** are set in the ground, scattered around the room. These control the flow of water to the wheel. The entire system powers and regulates a clockwork magic dampening field that permeates the cave and stretches into the countryside beyond, ebbing and flowing with the amount of water in the cavern (which is why the machinery malfunctions in the springtime; the Rockseekers' and now Nezznar and Vyerith poking around in the cave have caused the unseasonal problems with the field). **Each switch can be set to the left, right, or center;** they are in various settings when the players enter the room.
* **Glyphs** set in the floor glow with a strength corresponding to that of the dampening field.
* A **display case** set to the side shows numerous, ever-improving automata designs, ranging from a simple single-purpose construct like the string players and butlers they've already encountered, to something that almost looks like a modern warforged. Players can discover weapons, equipment, or other tools among these automata, if you feel like they need some extra oomph for the final battle or one of them hasn't been able to pick up anything cool for their character.
* **Phandelver's notes** are scattered on a table nearby. They concern his efforts to create artificial life in ever-larger and complex forms, contacts and enemies he's made, his involvement with House Cannith, and whatever other seeds you'd like to plant for future adventures.
* The **rock ceiling of the cavern is very thin** in parts, most visible when players stand at the switches. In some places the stars can even be seen. A few direct hits with large weapons, or fireballs, would probably open up a spot...

Once the players have begun exploring this room, especially if they mess with any switches or the water wheel, the Kingmaker speaks to them in a loud, rumbling voice. It watched helplessly as its creators were slaughtered nearly a century ago, and has been imprisoned in this cave ever since, trapped in a sort of fitful half-sleep by the various perturbations of the dampening field. In recent days, Vyerith has interrogated it, sometimes in the guise of Phandelver or other figures from its past, frequently promising to free it but never doing so, flipping switches (which causes it pain) and generally having a good time mocking it. It has grown to despair ever leaving this cave, and **asks the players to pull all the switches to the right,** strengthening the dampening field to the point where its spirit would fully dis-incorporate and it would be ""free"" (ie die).

However, hopefully the players instead realize that **they could choose to pull the switches to the LEFT** to take down the dampening field entirely. If they do this, they can release the airship from the field's clutches and allow it to increasingly assist in the fight. Flipping *all* the switches will destroy the field and allow the ship to attack the ceiling and **break free of the mountain.** It will be incredibly grateful to whoever does this, and pledge to serve them so long as they promise to never trap it in a cave again.

If the players made it to this area before encountering **Nezznar** in his quarters in the northwest, he will come upon them before they can fully act on the switches, flanked by two bugbears and four spiders. Thanking them for their effort in defeating the cave's various enemies and traps that had kept him from this room, he will now fight for control of the Kingmaker, which has been his ultimate goal since the start. He will attempt to flip the switches to the left, board the ship, and convince it to do his bidding, attacking the players and escaping the cave.

**Vyerith** may also be with him, perhaps pretending to be a ""captured"" Nundro Rockseeker, or else someone else the party has encountered earlier in the adventure. She will maintain this disguise as long as possible; if she's given a weapon, she may occasionally ""miss"" enemies and hit or interfere with the players instead. She may also flip switches, destroy the rope bridge, etc. If the fight turns against Nezznar, **she will betray him without a second thought**; she was only after chaos and destruction, and clearly he's outmatched.

She may also try to capture the airship herself, for her own ends, or if cornered after the fight she may try to parlay with the characters, perhaps appearing as people from their past (she can read their minds). As a final measure, she will pull a potion of invisibility from her belt, drink it, and attempt to escape, to be faced in some future adventure.

If Nezznar is captured, he will also escape.

&gt;SIDENOTE: In our session, the Kingmaker shook him off his feet and over its stern railing, and then backed into a wall, killing him and dropping him into the abyss.

Level the characters one last time, probably to Level 5. They're now Tier II and ready to take on the world!

\------

**ON TO FURTHER ADVENTURE**

Hopefully the players are able to defeat both Nezznar and Vyerith, free the ship, and break out of the cave. What they do next is up to them, and you.

If the characters are Aundairian military, their doing anything except handing over the ship to their superiors (ie Sgt. Hallwinter, by now fully recovered in Phandalin) will be viewed as treason of the highest order. Even if they aren't military, Aundair, House Cannith, and House Lyrandar will not be happy to have a sentient airship purpose-built for war roaming free (all will feel that they should control it), and will do their best to capture or destroy it. Taking the ship themselves, then, all but guarantees that the players will be hunted as sky pirates. On the other hand, it all but guarantees that they will be **HUNTED AS SKY PIRATES.**

If they hand over the ship to Aundair, it will of course be used to subjugate the locals, especially any that the characters rat out as hostile to Aundairian interests. Such an upset to the fragile balance of post-War power may even reignite a continent-wide conflict.

The characters could also choose to give the ship to the locals, who may or may not use it well, perhaps seeking to declare their own independent state within the Eldeen Reaches. It's likely that Halia Thornton will find a way to take charge of it, like she does.

If Vyerith and/or the Black Spider escape, particularly with the airship, then of course the players will want to chase them down, perhaps traveling all over Khorvaire to do it.

Once he recovers from mourning his brother, Gundren (and Nundro, if the players find and free him; otherwise you can assume he's dead) will make his way into the cave and attempt to continue Phandelver's work, perhaps even developing his own brand of warforged or other creations.

And of course, you have lots of other opportunities to plant further seeds of adventure within the cave or the town.

#Last, your pantheon can be made of canon D&amp;D gods! 

You don't have to have custom deities to fill the ranks (Mine doesn't! I use most of the Dawn War pantheon). But this will be a project to build a custom framework for fitting in whatever specific gods you want! Those can be ones you've made up or ones like Bahamut and Tiamat. 
___

To start building a pantheon, let’s zoom out all the way to the biggest picture possible and examine the biggest questions possible.  This will give us a core structure to work with for the rest of the project. For part 1, we’re going to examine the nature of divinity and what it means to have phenomenal cosmic power by asking ourselves the following questions: 

1. What makes a deity a deity? Are they truly immortal? Can they be killed? 

2. What kinds of powers do all of your deities have? What kinds of things are gods responsible for? 

3. How did your gods become gods? Were they just always there? Did they Ascend? 
4. Do your gods require worship to be powerful? Are they just innately powerful regardless of worship? Or do they get their power from somewhere else? 
5. Are there any other strange quirks that your pantheon has?

###Example: 

1. In Pretara, the gods are ideals whose purity gives them power. They are the purest, and most extreme incarnation of whatever concept they represent. Honor is incapable of breaking an oath, Desolation is void of feelings, and Preservation does not discriminate in who they provide shelter to. Each God is has a shard of divinity within them that grants them a level of power, and although the Shards are eternal, a deity's vessel can be damaged enough to reveal the Shard. If it is removed from its vessel, the original body withers away and the shard will claim the new body as its own.
2. In this world, the gods tend to be distant and avoid acting directly within creation. A tenuous peace is maintained between them all due to a complex web of alliances, and the collapse of these alliances would spell doom for the mortal races, whose actions and affiliations the gods rely on for power. 
3. Ultimately, all the divinities in Pretara were mortals at some point in history.  Some gods, like Endurance, have existed as long as creation itself, others are newer. But all of them were once mortals that ascended as their shard's Ideal corrupted them. 
4. The Pretaran gods do not require worship. Instead, they gain power when mortals act in line with whatever Ideal they represent. Acting out in anger might lend power to the God of Hatred, freeing slaves and those in bondage gives power to the God of Autonomy, and achieving your goals gives power to the God of Ambition. It is possible for actions to lend power to multiple deities in this way. While all the deities have a minimum level of power granted by their divine nature that is well above even 20th level heroes, but they gain more power when mortals act in line with their nature.

#Curses
##Death Curses
A Death Curse is a special type of curse you place on a creature when you die. Performing a Death Curse destroys your own soul in the process but can be used to lash out in a final burst of power against a creature that killed you. When another creature causes you to automatically die or to take damage, and that damage reduces you to 0 hp, you can choose to target them with your death curse if you are aware of their presence (although you do not need to see them). If you do, choose from one of the following effects or one that your DM approves. If you fail your final death saving throw, your soul is burned away and the curse goes into effect. You cannot be resurrected, even with *true resurrection*,  *wish*, or intervention from a deity. There is no known way to remove a death curse, even with wish or assistance from a deity.  

1. When the target is brought to 0hp, it automatically fails all of its death saves and its soul also burns away, making resurrection impossible, even with a wish spell. Creatures without souls, or whose souls are not contained in their bodies (like liches) are not affected by this. 
2. The target’s body becomes afflicted with a crippling curse that eats away at it. Each year, the target’s Constitution score is reduced by 1. When the target’s Constitution reaches 0, they die. Bringing the target back to life requires true resurrection or wish. 
3. The target’s senses betray them and they can no longer see, hear, or smell. If they have darkvision, blindsight, blindsense, or tremorsense, these abilities no longer work.
4. Radiant chains and manacles appear, and latch onto the creature. Attacks against the creature always have advantage, no matter how many sources of disadvantage would affect the attacks, and the target cannot dash. 
5. Your soul is condensed into a crystal the size of your heart, and the targeted creature is imprisoned within it. This functions like imprisonment except that nothing short of a wish or the express will of a deity that is fully informed on what is contained can release the targeted creature. This effect only works if the target's hitpoints are less than or equal to 10x your character's level when you die.
6. Your soul flares in a wide burst of radiant energy. Creatures within 120 ft of you that are allied with the target of your death curse take radiant damage equal to 10x your character’s level. This damage bypasses resistance and immunity for all creatures except deities. 


###Deathsong
Victims of the Deathsong curse endure agonizing pain for the rest of their short lives. They can do nothing but shriek and wail as their skin and bones grow brittle, and eventually break and waste away.

   To perform a Deathsong  Curse, you must have an organic piece of muscle or fatty tissue from your target, a pouch of dust of dryness, and a vial of ground spines from a bone devil. 

   First, the dust of dryness and ground devil spines must be mixed together in an iron bowl. Then, the target’s tissue is added to the bowl and covered in the dust. Then the bowl must be hung over a source of fire, and allowed to dry and cure over the course of a few weeks. 

   Once this ritual starts and every day until they either die or the ritual is broken, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or their Constitution score decreases by 1 as their body begins to painfully wither and blacken. As the curse progresses, the skin eventually cracks to reveal dried muscle tissue and their bones become especially brittle. If the tissue is removed from over the fire at any point before the victim’s Constitution score reaches 0, they are likely to survive, but any damage to their ability score is permanent.

###Melting Madness
This curse causes the target’s mind to begin to slip into insanity. While their mind descends into madness, their skin also begins to sag and droop, until it eventually sloughs off and they die.

   Components for this ritual include a sample of tissue from the target, such as muscle, skin, or even hair; a pint of water from the River Styx, and a vial of whatever foul substance is secreted by a Yochlol demon. 

   To begin the ritual, the target’s tissue sample should be submerged in a mixture made from the water from the River Styx and the Yochlol secretions, where it will begin to slowly dissolve. 

The creature you target with this curse makes an Intelligence saving throw (DC 10) or reduces their Intelligence score by 1. This save is repeated every day until the victim’s Intelligence score is reduced to 0. When their Intelligence score reaches 5, they also gain a form of madness (see DMG p258) and small sections of  skin begin to slide off their body. These symptoms will continue until the target’s Intelligence reaches 0 or the sample is removed from the ritual bowl.

#Dark Spells
The following spells have been recorded and added to the tome. While they cannot be scribed on scrolls or into spellbooks, any prepared spellcaster can prepare spells from this book as long as they are attuned to it.


###Circle of Nausea
2nd-level evocation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60ft 

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of rotting flesh)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A 20 ft radius of sickening magic emanates from a point you can see within range. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.

###Damning Darkness
4th-level evocation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60ft 

**Components**: V, S, M (bat fur, a drop of pitch, and a drop of blood)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

This spell functions as darkness except that creatures in the area when you cast the spell take 3d6 necrotic damage. Creatures in the area on your turn take another 3d6 necrotic damage.     

###Darklight

4th-level transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an agate worth 10gp)

**Duration**: 10 minutes
You touch a creature and cause it to emanate a strange, otherworldly darkness in a radius of 10 ft. Creatures in this radius can see normally in non-magical darkness to a range of 120ft. Areas affected by magical darkness appear as dim light to those inside the radius.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. If you use an 8th level spell slot, the effect lasts for 24 hours.  
###Despoil
9th-level necromancy

**Casting Time**: 24 hours

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 5,000 gp and a corpse of an intelligent humanoid no more than 24 hours old, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with unholy power. The area can have a radius up to 1 mile, and will dispel any areas already under the effects of a hallow spell. The affected area is then subject to the following effects. 

First, celestials, elementals, and fey cannot enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. 

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. When choosing an effect, you can designate specific creatures, or a creature type (such as fiends or humanoids) to be affected or unaffected. If a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area

1. **Courage &amp; Fear.** Evil creatures within the area are immune to the frightened condition, and good creatures are frightened. 

2. **Darkness &amp; Silence.** The area is filled with magical darkness. Normal light and magical light created by anything less than a 9th level spell cannot illuminate the area. Additionally no sound can be heard by any creature within the spell’s area.

3. **Energy Protection &amp; Vulnerability.** Choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Evil creatures gain resistance to a damage type of your choice, and good creatures that enter the space gain vulnerability to a damage type of your choice if they are not immune or resistant. If a good creature is resistant to the chosen damage type, they instead suffer the normal effects of an attack. If a good creature is immune to the chosen damage type, that immunity instead becomes resistance.

4. **Negative Energy.** Non-evil creatures within the area must make a Charisma saving throw or suffer 1d4 necrotic damage for each hour they spend within the area. This effect still occurs every hour, even if they make the initial save.

###Eye of the Beholder
7th-level transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration of the spell, one of your eyes grows out of your head on a stalk, becoming like that of a beholder. When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns, you may target a creature within 120 feet with a ray from the eyestalk. Roll a d8 to determine what effect the ray has. 

1. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature makes a Constitution saving throw or is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

2. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 

3. Slowing Ray. Target makes a Dexterity saving throw or is affected as if by the slow spell. Target can repeat the save at the end of each  of its turn, ending it on a success.

4. Enervation Ray. Target makes a Constitution save or takes 8d8 necrotic damage, or half as much on a success. 

5. Telekinetic Ray. Target makes a Strength save  or can be moved 30 ft in any direction. It is also restrained by the ray’s grip until the start of your next turn or the spell ends. 
6. Sleep Ray. Targeted creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep for 1 minute. This ray does not affect constructs, fey, undead, or creatures with 50 hit points or more.
7. Disintegration Ray. Target makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes 10d8 force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.
8. Death Ray. Targeted creatures makes a Dexterity Saving throw or takes 10d10 necrotic damage. The target automatically dies if this ray reduces them to 0 hp. 

###Eyes of the Dead
3rd-level divination

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (one of your own eyes and a vial of brackish water)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You remove one of your own eyes from your head, and an eye from an undead that you control, if it has one. After washing the eyes in a pint of brackish water, you can insert your eye into your undead thrall’s head, and your thrall’s eye into your own head. For the duration, you can control your undead and perceive the world through it. When the undead creature is killed or the spell ends, your eye magically returns to you.
###False Sending
5th-level illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of corroded copper wire)

**Duration**: 1 round

You contact a creature with whom you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less per *sending*. The target believes the *sending* came from another creature that you specify at the time of casting. You must also be familiar with the creature you want your target to think is responsible for the false sending.  The target can respond if they choose. The spell does not force your target to believe what is said. If you say something that is unlikely to be said by your false sender, the target may think they are being contacted under duress.
###Fangs of the Vampire
2nd-level transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of vampire vitae)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you grow long fangs and can bite a creature within 5ft of you that you can see. When you cast this spell, and as an action on subsequent turns, make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 2d10 necrotic damage to the target. 

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd. 
###Forbidden Speech
5th-level enchantment

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent

You make it impossible for the target to speak about a certain topic of your choosing. Topics must be specific, such as time spent in captivity, or what they saw over the past 10 minutes. Invalid topics include verbal spellcasting components, a creature’s life history, etc.

The target  makes an Intelligence saving throw or is subject to the spell. They still remember the topic, but have no way of communicating information about it Words become gibberish, drawings or writings are too messy to make out, gestures are too erratic, and even thoughts are too muddled to understand via telepathy. 

This spell’s effects can be removed or healed with greater restoration or similar magic.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, its effects can only be removed if greater restoration or similar magic is cast at the same level or higher. 
###Imprison Possessor
5th-level abjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30ft 

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled

You trap a creature that can possess or inhabit another creature, or one that can move its mind out of its body, within the creature it is currently inhabiting. As long as the spell is in effect, the target is trapped in its current body and cannot leave it by any means. 

###Pestilence
8th-level necromancy

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

Any ability score changes last for up to one hour and then return to normal.

#Fiendish Truenames
Names written in this section appear to be compiled by at least a dozen different people. Some of the names are written in clear and neat handwriting, others in hastily made chicken scratch. Some are marked out and most others have been completely blotted out with an impossibly dark ink stain. Some are listed with information or commentary from previous authors, and others are listed with no notes at all. All the names are written in Dark Speech, and speaking one of these names aloud will cause psychic damage per the normal rules for Dark Speech.

1. Ali’mannd

2. Brizzgon

3. Kahaar (This name is almost marked out enough that you cannot decipher it.)

4. Tolgath

5. Xargrag - DANGEROUS - in huge, blocky letters, is written in the margin next to this name. It is underlined several times. 

6. Xorgruzal - The phrase “Information is pricey, but reliable. Use a Circle.” is scrawled in a small, messy hand.

#Lichdom
A long and exceedingly complicated process of how to achieve lichdom is described in painstaking detail with pages and pages of diagrams and arcane sigils. The instructions are jumbled, and there are many notes in the corner that reference secrets and advice acquired from powerful beings. The only three entities referred to by name are called Vecna, Acererak, and Orcus. There is also mention of a Council and a warning that they should not be sought out for information on this topic. While the actual process is not in any sensical order, it could be organized into the following sections. 
##The Phylactery
All of the paths to lichdom require a phylactery to store the soul and prevent it from returning to The Weave. The theories presented in the book describe several different opinions on what makes the best phylactery, but the basics are as follows. 

**A Container.** The Phylactery requires a series of complex arcane symbols and lines be created on the interior of the container. There is no apparent issue with sealing or locking it once your soul is contained within, but it also must be able to open and close before your spirit is stored inside. Because of this, a solid object cannot be used as a phylactery. Each aspiring lich must also create their own phylactery that is unique to them. Attempting to use a phylactery made by anyone else will fail to house the soul properly and ruin the ritual.

**Sizing Requirements.** The authors of the *Book of Vile Darkness* seem to think that any volume is theoretically possible, even down to a fine grain of sand, but the practical aspects of adding the requisite arcane marks on such a small surface pose a problem. The smallest recommended size is about the size of a ring box. 

**Expensive Components.** Although there is no indication that the base material a phylactery is made from has any larger influence on the core magic, durable and expensive materials seem to be better suited for such a long-term task. Iron or Adamantine, for example make the phylactery physically harder to destroy. Additionally, the runes on the interior must be carved out and then filled with a pure silver. The purification of the silver is laborious and requires magical components that cost at least 10,000 gp alone.

##The Rituals
Once the phylactery is complete, the ritual can be performed. This long and intricate process must be done with care, and everyone involved must be wholly dedicated to completing it, with the exception of any unwilling sacrifices.

**The Supplies.** In addition to the phylactery, someone that undergoes this ritual will need 10 barrels of water from the River Styx, five additional allied spellcasters to help manage and focus the energy properly, and a 20th-level spellcaster to lead and perform the process. 

**The Offerings.** Ascension to lichdom requires the sacrifice of several spellcasters. In total, the ritual requires sacrificing at least ten 9th-level (or higher) spellcasters that do not include the creature seeking to become a lich. If the sacrifices are genuinely willing to die in this endeavor, the number needed is halved. 

**The Site.** The location for this ritual must be under the effects of a despoil spell or a 9th-level hallow spell that has been specifically perverted to create undead instead of prevent them. Several of the arcane symbols included in the section must be dug or cut into stone ground for the sacrificial blood to form the symbols needed, and an outer ring that forms a shallow moat around the entire site must be dug and filled with the water from the Styx. 

**The Final Process.** The person who will be turning into the lich must go to each sacrifice and kill them individually using a Karras Stone Knife (see the Macabre Rituals section below) while the leader recites the incantation. As the sacrificial blood fills the arcane circles, the person seeking lichdom must take their own life with the Karras Knife and attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 30). On a success, the ritual will capture and store the person’s soul in the phylactery and they will rise as a lich. On a failure, the target simply dies and the ritual fails. If enemies infiltrate the ritual and are not detected, the Arcana check is made with disadvantage.

#Macabre Rituals 
Some of the rituals included rely on the metaphysical concept of thaumaturgy, which is not the same as the common parlour trick magics performed by many clerics (although such tricks rely on similar theory). This kind of thaumaturgy refers to a concept of *“As above, so below.”* If you can make something happen on a small scale, you can cause it to happen on a larger scale. Additionally, all of the ritual incantations included here must be spoken aloud in Dark Speech, and will incur the normal psychic damage associated. 
##Green Fog
Dense clouds of greenish mist roll across wide swaths of land. Any living creature that touches the mist is polymorphed into a random beast. This fog usually covers an area of 1-4 miles across and lasts for up to 10 minutes at any given time. The ritual that creates a Green Fog is fairly simple, and its ingredient list is short and also flexible. 

At its core, this ritual relies on a large iron cauldron that is filled with the blood of shapechangers and a small model of the area to be affected. When placed over a fire and  the blood is brought to a boil, notable bits of local fauna are dropped in and stirred while the incantation is recited. Using bird wings, rabbit feet or ears, or deer antlers are common, but any beast should work. After an hour of stirring and incantations, a thin green mist should form and the final incantation should be performed and the model submerged in the mixture. The fog will form at the edge of the area closest to where the ritual is being performed and will move across the region until it reaches the other edge and dissipates. It will flow into buildings if windows and doors are not sealed tightly, but it does not ascend stairs or ramps. Any creatures that are touched by the mist will be subjected to its effects, which last until dispelled. Creatures with the shapechanger tag are immune to these effects. 

If the blood used is more than 48 hours old, whoever is performing the ritual must make an Intelligence (arcana) check (DC 15). If the ritual is performed under a full moon, this check is made with advantage. 
##Karras Stone Knife
Usually used in sacrificial rituals, a Karras Stone Knife leaves ragged cuts, causing a creature that takes damage from one to take additional damage at the start of their turn. Additionally, if a Karras knife is used to harvest flesh for a curse, the target makes any curse-related saving throws with disadvantage. These knives are carved from a Karras Stone, from which they get their name, which can be acquired through a dark ritual. 

Completing this ritual requires sacrificing an intelligent creature during the a lunar eclipse. The day prior, the sacrifice must eat a large meal of fatty foods like bacon, ham, or foods that use a lot of butter or other fats. The actual ritual must take place outdoors and under the open sky, and includes an incantation that must be started at the beginning of the totality. Begin by wrapping a small pebble with a stomach lining from a sheep, pig, or other domesticated livestock beast and holding it above the abdomen of the sacrifice as the incantation is spoken. The sacrifice must be slain in the final moments of totality by stabbing into the victim’s stomach. After the ritual has completed, the Karras Stone can be cut free from the sacrifice’s gallbladder and then honed into a knife used for curses.  
##Rain of Blood
Rolling in like a normal thunderstorm, this macabre weather system’s heavy rains turn to blood, covering the area in a thick, dark, sticky red mess. Any living, non-evil creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 24 hours. The DC of this effect begins at 10, but can be increased  depending on the quality of materials used. 

This ritual requires a small model of the target area to be crafted. The model does not have to be exceedingly accurate, but for every full day spent crafting the model, the ritual’s save DC increases by +1 to a maximum of +5. Additionally, the process requires a small amount of blood. Generally the ritual caster will use their own blood, but the blood of a fiendish creature increases the DC by a number equal to that creature’s challenge to a maximum of +5.

Performing the actual ritual is fairly straightforward. A short incantation is recited while water is poured over the model and then, while the model is still wet, the blood must be dripped over it. If successful, a rain shower will blow across the location the next day and suddenly shift to rain blood for  1d10 minutes.

##Third Eye
This ritual involves a willing target to undergo a physical disfiguration to plant a petrified eye into their forehead. Depending on the ritual used, this third eye can allow the target to see invisible creatures, into the ethereal plane for 1 minute per day, or some other similar effect. 

The core of this ritual relies on the type of eye used. Harvesting an eye from a creature that can see invisibility grants that power. Likewise, many creatures have blindsight, true seeing, or can peer into the minds of other creature around them. Only one effect can be granted from this ritual though, so if a creature has multiple abilities that could be used, you must choose which one to gain. 

The process requires assistance from at least one other person and the use of a Karras Stone Knife. Whoever is gaining the Third eye must be restrained on a table that has a ritual circle carved into it around their head. Care can also be taken to immobilize the head to minimize damage, but this is not required. As the incantation is recited, the forehead must be cut open deeply enough to create a groove in the bone of the skull. The harvested Eye is then placed over the wound until the incantation is completed. Creatures that undergo this process gain 4 levels of exhaustion until they complete a long rest and disadvantage on sight-based perception checks for 5 days while they get used to the new eye. 
##Violet Storm
A Violet Storm is made of deep purple and blue clouds that block out light from the sun almost entirely. Red flashes of lightning flicker across the sky and to the ground. During the storm, magic items don’t function and any spellcasters must make spellcasting ability check (DC 15). On a failure, they cannot regain spell slots during a long or short rest for 24 hours. A Violet Storm will usually last for 2d6 days, and spellcasters must attempt to make the saving throw each day in order to to cast spells. 

This ritual has several aspects that usually require different skill sets, and so it is often performed with a group. A character that wants to aid another in part of the ritual or its preparation must have the requisite proficiencies to perform the given task.

Like most rituals that affect a geographic area, a model of the region is needed. For this specific ritual, the model must be particularly finely crafted from silver or gold and worth at least 10,000gp per square mile to be affected. A creature that is proficient in smith’s tools or jeweler’s tools can craft the item over the course of a week for half the cost with a Dexterity check (DC 20). 

Aside from the model, a medium sized iron cauldron must be at least half-filled with blood or viscera from creatures that have spell resistance and a challenge rating of 10 or more. The text recommends acquiring such materials from fiends that have been sentenced to punishment for whatever transgressions they committed against their superiors, but mentions that many fey creatures also are resistant to magic and could be an option. 

The rest of the process is fundamentally straightforward, but does require some nuance. Different ingredients reach different stages at different times, so knowing when to change the direction of stirring and when to cover the model in the liquid requires an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 20). After submerging the model in the liquid or pouring the liquid over the model (for particularly large areas), whoever is conducting the incantation must make a Charisma (Performance) check (DC 20). If the ritual is successful, the liquid will burn off the model and leave a thick purple grime behind. The following day, a Violet Storm will cover the area for 2d6 days.

#Poison Recipes
The poisons described below can generally be administered in any way a person wants - either inhalation, ingestion, or directly into the bloodstream through a physical weapon attack. The book emphasizes the most common ways of administering these toxins, which tend to be the most effective way as well, but most of them can still be utilized through other methods as well. 

###Agony
Anything that would normally be painful to the target is interpreted by their mind as something that feels pleasurable instead. Any attacks rolled against someone who is poisoned with Agony are made with advantage.  

This poison is made from a type of plant with razor-sharp leaves that grows only in the acidic environment of Minauros, the third circle of Hell or any acrid environments within the Abyss. It can be ground into a paste, brewed into a tea, or dried and crushed into a powder. Generally, Agony is ingested through the poisoning of food or drink. It takes approximately 1 hour to metabolize, after which the victim makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or is subject to the effects. 
###Devilweed
Devilweed is a plant that looks like a dark brown or reddish grass that always grows on rocks. However, the rocky base is part of the plant. When disturbed, the leaves retract into the rock. Unless someone is particularly stealthy, this plant is usually harvested by waiting nearby for the leaves to emerge from the stone after being disturbed. 

If added to any potion, Devilweed corrupts the liquid. The original effects will still function normally, but the victim must make a DC 15 Constitution save or become exceedingly paranoid for the next 24 hours. Extended exposure to Devilweed can result in a permanent paranoia or other forms of madness.  

###Feather Powder
Designed specifically to target celestial creatures, this fine red powder sticks remarkably well to feathers. This powder is made from a mixture of volcanic rock, dried burs, and dirt from an unhallowed or evil place. When mixed together and dried, the final product should be a reddish color, although anything from a bright crimson to a muddy rust color will work. 

If a vial is thrown and hits a celestial creature with wings, it deals 2d4 necrotic damage each round. The target can use an action to attempt a DC 15 Dexterity check to shake the dust out of their wings and end the effect. If the dust was made using *Dust of Sneezing and Choking*, the check is made with disadvantage.

###Fire Venom
The target’s skin reddens and their insides seem to burn for 4-5 days. During the worst of this, the victim vomits red and orange bile, but it’s rarely lethal. Crafting Fire Venom isn’t difficult, but the ingredients can be hard to come by. It requires a special species of white flower that only grows in frigid arctic areas. The plant is difficult to find, but easy to identify by its bright white petals that are speckled with tiny reddish dots. 

To craft this poison, the entire flower, stems and leaves included, must be steeped in icy water for 48 hours until it begins to fall apart. After this, remove the flower pieces and grind them into a paste. This paste can be stored in a vial until it is ready to be used. 

###Lightning Toxin

A target’s blood vessels expand and swell and create a lightning pattern across the skin. The toxin will eventually cause the victim’s veins to burst and they will bleed to death. 

Brewing this toxin requires some rare ingredients, including a spoonful of magnetized iron filings and the ground scales of a blue or bronze dragon. When the metal dust and ground scales are mixed together in a ceramic bowl and melted over a fire, they will combine to form Lightning Toxin. When cooled, the toxin is solid but can be easily cut with a knife or grated into flakes.  

This toxin is only effective if ingested, and after 6-8 hours, the victim will develop the physical symptoms. After 24 hours, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 20) or die from blood loss. If they succeed, they will eventually recover, but their skin will still bear distinct lightning-shaped scars.

###Moradyne Vapors (Dreammist)
^(^pronounced ^more-a-dine ^to ^avoid ^confusion ^with ^Moradin, ^the ^dwarven ^deity)

Moradyne is a large fern that grows in temperate and tropical forests. It can only be found in the most remote areas of such places, and is generally avoided because of the painful stinging [trichomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichome) that grow on its surface. However, if it is collected and the hairs removed, the plant can be brewed into a tea. If the vapors from Moradyne Tea are inhaled or ingested, a victim falls unconscious for 1d3 hours, during which time they experience vivid and beautiful dreams. 

###Petrani 
Another lethal poison, Petrani is made from fairly mundane ingredients, but requires special equipment to mix properly. It calls for a delicate mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary stones (the text recommends granite, marble, and coal, although any stones of those types will work). 

The stones must be ground and blended together and then melted under very high levels of heat for a full 24 hours. The level of heat required is more than wood or coal forges are capable of, and the text recommends using forges in Phlegethos, the fourth circle of Hell. After this point, it should be allowed to cool, and then it can be easily broken apart into a fine dust that can dissolve into most liquids. 

If ingested, the target gains +1 to their AC as their skin grows thicker. Each day after this, the target loses one point of Dexterity, 5ft of movement, and gains another point of AC. When their dex reaches zero, they begin to suffocate and die. Making a successful Constitution save (DC 20) can delay the effect for one day, but there is no known cure for the poison. 

###Terran Brandy
Made from the glittering dust harvested from a dying fey creature and distilling it into a potent alcohol with normal distillation methods. If prepared correctly, this can bolster spellcasting by increasing the save DC of any enchantment spells by +1, but it is usually used for its ability to cause hallucinations. When dosed properly, a person that drinks Terran Brandy sees beautiful and enchanting visions of alluring fey creatures in place of real people and creatures. Additional notes in the text suggest using this as a method to lure people away from crowded areas.

#Vampirism
Most people that become vampires do so by starting as a thrall to another vampire and serving them until finding a chance to escape or kill their sire.  But the pages in this book speak of another way to become a vampire - a path that that requires no servitude to anyone else. 

This ritual can only be performed under a total solar eclipse, and must be completed at the first moments of totality so that the transformation completes before the eclipse ends. Just like the ritual path to lichdom, this preparation involves a hallow spell that has been inverted to bolster the strength of undead instead of preventing their creation and the killing of ten living sacrifices. It also requires the use of an iron cup with specific necromantic sigils engraved on its surface. As the eclipse begins, but before the totality, the would-be vampire must kill each of the sacrifices while reciting the incantation and letting their victims' blood soak into the ground. As each sacrifice dies, the ritual cup must be filled with the last of their life blood, which must be ingested by the ritualist.  

As the moment of totality nears, the person attempting to transform into a vampire must cut into their own throat and fill the cup with their own blood. As the totality begins, they must drink from the cup, and let the rest of their blood soak into the ground. Before they die, they make an Intelligence (Aracana) check (DC 20). This check is made with advantage if a Karras Stone Knife is used. On a success, they will rise as a vampire at the peak of the eclipse, but they must find a shelter before the totality ends to avoid burning in the sun.

#Killing a God
There is only one page that mentions anything in line with this - and only about a third of it still exists within the book - the other pages seem to be torn out.  Out of the remaining legible text, it seems that someone has attempted to record a process to kill or destroy a deity. The tiny bits that you can make out reference a shard, something about enemies being more powerful than neutral gods, and several notations of how dangerous the process is. 
",1,Macabre Rituals and Dark Spells: A Supplement for The Book of Vile Darkness
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,38,199,"#The Plan
So we’ve created a one-shot adventure. Your group had a blast with it, because of course they did, but now they want you to expand this into a fully fledged homebrew campaign. And holy cow, where do you even start? There’s already plenty of resources on creating maps, and building the geography of your world, but what we need is a world that feels internally consistent and real. So let’s zoom way out and take a look at building the foundations of the cosmos and the nature of its most powerful beings that shape and form everything else in your game’s world and universe. 

This month, we’re going to build a pantheon. This isn’t going to be one huge post for the Codex of the Gods, and we aren’t going to be looking at individual deities until the very end. Instead, we’re going to examine the nature of divinity in your world, how this divinity interacts with and informs the worlds and mortals in them,  and at the end will build a framework to fill with specific deities. A lot of this month’s project is going to have much higher-level meta discussions than last month’s, but the goal is to create a solid foundation to build your worlds on top of! 
___________
#The Prize
At the end of this event, we will choose the best pantheons. Like last month, one will be selected by the mods of BTS, and the other two will be voted for by the community here. And, again like the last challenge, winners will be given a flair of their choice. In addition though, I will create a single custom character portrait for each of the winners. (Here are some [EXAMPLES](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/eKz9D) of the style you can expect)

This project is a little less flashy than writing your own one shot, but we hope that it will help inform the rest of your campaigns, and maybe help you put your own unique spins on the way that divinity works!

#Clarifications:

This Theme Month contest officially begins on the 2nd when the first Event Announcement goes up! Ideally this'll be around midnight CST, unless I forget to post it before I go to bed. That post will be examining the nature of divinity and will include a set of questions for y'all to consider and answer. 

To submit your entry, you'll answer the questions as a comment on that event post. Then on the 7th we'll have the Event for Greater Deities along with more questions to answer for your pantheons. 

Wash, rinse, and repeat as we go through the month. 

On the 24th, the final post will go up where you can put together everything you've done so far and post a comment on that announcement. When the month ends, we'll compile all the posts and set up a final post where the sub can vote for their favorites! 

If this still feels confusing or you're not sure, then just keep an eye out for the first Event tomorrow. I'll be including an example from my home campaign to help clarify any lingering questions! 

",1,February is Build a Pantheon Month!
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,44,579,"The Wish spell is one of the original spells in D&amp;D.  Some people love the spell, some people hate the spell, and most of us spend our time figuring out how to get wording of our wish exactly right so the DM doesn’t screw us over.  Wish is probably the most discussed and argued over spell in D&amp;D, since what you can and cannot do is the subject of endless debate.  No two DM’s we have played with have allowed the wish spell to do the same thing.  While the spell description gives some guidelines as to the specific things that can happen, the DM has probably more latitude with this spell than any other.

*I, personally, have 3 rules for Wish:* **One sentence, must start with the words “I Wish for…”, and be said in 6 seconds.**

*In return, I promise to not be a jerk and only manipulate a wish for the sake of the game and story.*

&amp;nbsp;

**OD&amp;D**

There was no wish spell in the original D&amp;D (and many people probably would have preferred it stayed that way).  The first mention of the wish spell was presented in the Greyhawk supplement 1, released in 1976.  The wish was basically split into two parts - limited wish and wish.

&gt; **Limited Wish**
&gt;
&gt; *7th Level Magic User*
&gt;
&gt; A spell which alters reality past, present, or future, but only within limited bounds. It cannot create or bring any form of treasure, for example, and only a portion of a wish might actually occur. (See DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, MONSTERS &amp; TREASURE, page 33, Three Wishes.)


&gt; **Wish**
&gt;
&gt; *9th Level Magic User*
&gt;
&gt; The same spell as found in a Ring of Wishes (DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, MONSTERS &amp; TREASURE, page 33). Using a Wish Spell, however, requires so great a conjuration that the user will be unable to do anything further magically for 2-8 days.
&gt; 
&gt; The referenced wish information above is from the Ring of Three Wishes, which states the following:
&gt; 
&gt; **Ring of Three Wishes** (DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, MONSTERS &amp; TREASURE): As with any wishes, the wishes granted by the ring must be of limited power in order to maintain balance in the game. This requires the utmost discretion on the part of the referee. Typically, greedy characters will request more wishes, for example, as one of their wishes. The referee should then put that character into an endless closed time loop, moving him back to the time he first obtained the wish ring. Again, a wish for some powerful item could be fulfilled without benefit to the one wishing (“I wish for a Mirror of Life Trapping!”, and the referee then places the character inside one which is all his own!). Wishes that unfortunate adventures had never happened should be granted. Clues can be given when wishes for powerful items or great treasure are made.

Lots of information here, but at the same time, so much more is left unsaid. Limited wish is more of an alter time spell. Based on the description,  you cannot expect to receive much of anything physical, such as magic items or gold. But by being able to change the timeline, here’s a few examples that we can think of that limited wish could be used for

**Past** - Change the outcome of a fight. Change what a NPC said to you. Go back to a time before a player died

**Present** - Change your location to a different town, continent or even possibly plane. Change the outcome of a saving throw, ability check or attack roll.

**Future** - Change the probable outcome of fight that is going poorly.  Your status within society, such as making yourself a knight or noble. 

The ability to change future is probably the most interesting, and most complicated. Changing the future has the most potential for being a workaround to get something resembling wealth.  By changing the future you might decide to make yourself king of the land.  By doing so, one might assume that you could have all the riches you could ever want, not to mention a castle, armed guards at your disposal, and a beautiful queen at your side. 

This is where Gary G. has decided to add his usual “srew you” to OD&amp;D rules. He spends more time giving the DM suggestions on how to screw over the character’s wish than he does describing the actual spell. Sure, the basic concept of what a wish is seems pretty straight forward, but in reality it’s not. Why just give examples on how to mess with people? It’s one thing to maintain balance, it’s another to actively they to screw the player over.

So, using the example above of changing the future, the DM may say “sure, you can be a king” but based on how Gary describes the spell, the DM may decide to have you constantly under siege from neighboring kingdoms so you are spending all your money on paying your troops, weapons and castle fortifications.  Oh, and your wife was from an arranged marriage and she is more of a troll than a blushing bride.

The Wish spell also relies on the rules set in the Ring of Three Wishes, but has no limitations except for spell exhaustion.  Based on the information given (or lack thereof), the player can now ask for pretty much anything.  But once again, the focus seems to be on screwing the player over, regardless of what they wish for.

**2e**

In 2e, the spells mostly stay the same but without the helpful tips on how to screw over your players. For the sake of time we will be skipping out on the Limited Wish spell from here on out. 

&gt; **Wish** (Conjuration/Summoning) 
&gt;
&gt; **Range**: Unlimited 
&gt;
&gt; **Components**: V 
&gt;
&gt; **Duration**: Special 
&gt;
&gt; **Casting Time**: Special 
&gt;
&gt; **Area of Effect**: Special 
&gt;
&gt; **Saving Throw**: Special 
&gt;
&gt; The Wish spell is a more potent version of a limited wish. If it is used to alter reality with respect to damage sustained by a party, to bring a dead creature to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spellcaster (and his party) from one place to another, it will not cause the wizard any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space. and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact tenninology of the wish spell is likely to be carried out. Casting a wish spell ages the caster five years. 
&gt;
&gt;This discretionary power of the DM is necessary in order to maintain game balance. As wishing another creature dead would be grossly unfair, for example, your DM might well advance the spellcaster to a future period in which the creature is no longer alive, effectively putting the wishing character out of the campaign.
     
As far as spell descriptions go, this is pretty quick and to the point. It is interesting that it makes no mention of copying the effects of other spells without sadness visited upon the body of the spellcaster as later editions make a note of, but it does give several things a Wizard could wish for without disabilities like: healing, resurrection and teleportation (or if you are a real hardass and going by the specific wording of the spell: Levitate). 

We do appreciate the last paragraph letting the DM(and players) know that this spell is complete bonkers and asking for anything that might affect the story or be a huge McGuffin for the party may be adjusted to fit your Wish casting, even if it isn’t what you may specifically want. This latitude give the DM a power over the spell that, quite frankly, is needed.  Wish is a game breaker spell, and if the player chooses to fall back on RAW, this simple paragraph lets the DM rein in a player’s crazier desires.  This caveat is included, in some fashion, for all future editions. 

**3e/3.5e**

As with all things 3.5, things get a lot more complex, and it may not always be for the better. Hold on tight, this is a lot of information.

&gt; **Wish**
&gt;
&gt; *Universal*
&gt;
&gt; **Level**: Sor/Wiz 9
&gt;
&gt; **Components**: V, XP
&gt;
&gt; **Casting Time**: 1 standard action
&gt;
&gt; **Range**: See text
&gt;
&gt; **Target, Effect, or Area**: See text
&gt;
&gt; **Duration**: See text
&gt;
&gt; **Saving Throw**: See text
&gt;
&gt; **Spell Resistance**: Yes
&gt;
&gt; Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
&gt;
&gt; Even wish, however, has its limits.
&gt; 
&gt; A wish can produce any one of the following effects.
&gt;
&gt; • Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
&gt;
&gt; • Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
&gt;
&gt; • Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school.
&gt;
&gt; • Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school.
&gt;
&gt; • Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
&gt;
&gt; • Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.
&gt;
&gt; • Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
&gt;
&gt; • Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.
&gt;
&gt; • Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
&gt;
&gt; • Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.
&gt;
&gt; • Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
&gt;
&gt; • Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
&gt; 
&gt; You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)
&gt;
&gt; Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).
&gt;
&gt; Material Component: When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.
&gt;
&gt; XP Cost: The minimum XP cost for casting wish is 5,000 XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.
 
Whew.  That’s a whole lot of rules and stipulations, and my least favorite part about it… It costs XP to cast! We suppose that is one way to keep your players in check, but still, that’s a hefty price to pay for something that the DM is going to corrupt and twist your words on. 

But… its probably for the best that we add a few rules to the Wish spell and limit its power. You aren’t a god after all, just a mortal with a nasty spell that can change the shape of the world and time itself. You know, a normal tuesday for an adventurer.

We really like that we add some limitations to the Wish spell after years and editions of unlimited power that the DM is instructed to mess with. The players now have a clear set of things suggested that can can/should do. And while they do have the opportunity to try and use the spell for something greater and more powerful than actions listed, the DM is again given some latitude to make sure the players don’t do something completely outlandish.

**4e**

Once again, 4e follows none of the rules as the previous editions.  The Wish spells has been removed from list of spells available to players, and has become more of a plot device for the DM to use during the campaign. 

And that is pretty awesome.

For all the bashing that 4e has taken, this is arguably the best thing I have seen in 4e (ok, there are a bunch of really good things in 4e, but this easily my favorite). Taking the ability to cast Wish out of hands of players alleviates so many issues and gives the DM the latitude to make a wish something really important. And isn’t that the whole point of a wish? 

**5e**

&gt; **Wish**
&gt;
&gt; *9 conjuration* 
&gt;
&gt; **Casting Time**: 1 action
&gt;
&gt; **Range**: Self
&gt;
&gt; **Components**: V
&gt;
&gt; **Duration**: Instantaneous
&gt;
&gt; **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard
&gt; 
&gt; Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
&gt; 
&gt; The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:
&gt;
&gt; • You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
&gt;
&gt; • You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.
&gt;
&gt; • You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
&gt;
&gt; • You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
&gt;
&gt; • You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
&gt; 
&gt; You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.
&gt; 
&gt; The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

 
At last we reach 5e which does a good job of taking what 3e has to offer and putting a spin on it. We have limits on the Wish spell (good) and a pretty big con, a 33% chance of never casting Wish again. Whew, that’ll put your wish for a pony on hold when you may never be able to cast your Hail Mary spell again. 

Once again, more detail on what a character can and cannot do is specified in the description of the spell.  Also, the penalties now aren’t quite as harsh as the previous versions.  The wording allows the DM to be creative is how he/she can handle some of the more absurd requests.  This makes it interesting and challenging for both the player and the DM.

In conclusion, the Wish spell can be a complete game breaker, but only if the players try to pull some stupid shit and the DM allows it.  Wish can be a great spell, as it gives the spell caster the ability to create their own fun and/or get the party of some deep shit. ",1,Deep Dive: The Wish Spell Through the Editions
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,21,172,"Greetings all! I am by no means an expert, but I love mythology and any literature involving faeries, including all things related to Fey in DnD. I hope this post will perhaps inspire you, and that you find enjoyment in a brief distraction from the mundane world around us.

# What are Fey?

The Fey are magical creatures tied to the world of nature and folk tales. They gain life through the belief and doubt in the unknown. Fey are not merely short little men wearing green and hiding gold, they are so much more than that. The Fey are a baby’s first laugh and a man’s last breath, the first spring rain, the shade of the oak tree, the crunch of autumn leaves, and the last snowfall. They are the embodiment of ideas and folk tales come to life. They are birthed through imagination and dreams, and exist because we unknowingly bring them to life. Their mother is Imagination, their father Superstition. They are why we hang an iron horseshoe on the mantle, why we leave a bowl of milk on our doorstep, why we avoid stepping on cracks and breaking mirrors. The stronger the belief, the stronger the fey.

# The Good, The Bad, and what’s the deal?

The Fey are fickle creatures, some good, very many bad, but most exist within the realm of ambiguity. Creatures of the moral grey and chaos, they exist to exist, and to entertain themselves along the way. Some are harmless, playing small pranks or stealing objects to annoy people. But others are far more malevolent, kidnapping children or trapping travelers with illusions and lies. With the Fey, there is always a cost. The cost may be little, like leaving a baked scone on the windowsill in exchange for guarding the house against other fey. Or the cost may be great, your very own name for example, in exchange for the power to do what you must. The Fey love to strike a deal, but will almost always try to twist it in their favor. One must express extreme caution in dealings with the fey, lest they agree to something they had not bargained for. The Fey do not sign contracts like the devils, they use the power of words to seal the deal. By using words, secret meanings and implications may be verbally included without bringing attention to them.

# How to protect yourself against the Fey

The power of protection lies in the strength of belief. In faerie tales, there are several objects thought to ward off fey creatures. Examples would include: a piece of cold iron, a four-leaf clover, clothing worn inside out, an offering of food, certain herbs and flowers. Even keeping piece of dry bread in one’s pocket was thought to ward off unwanted attention of the fey. Some believe that a amulet or charm carved from a rowan tree wards off the Fey. The secret to this protection, is not in the object itself, but in the belief behind it.

Example Charm/Ward tables

Roll a D20 three times, find appropriate description for each value.

&amp;#x200B;

|Value|Material|Alteration|Condition|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1-2|A piece of raw iron|Baked for a month|Worn around your neck|
|3-4|A nugget of candle wax|Carved into a face|Kept in your left pocket|
|5-6|The knuckle bone of your aunt|Ground into dust and stored in a bottle|Adorning the mantle|
|7-8|A dried goblin finger|Soaked in whiskey|Attached to your belt|
|9-10|A piece of rowan wood|Buried until your birthday|Kept behind your right ear|
|11-12|A dragon fang|Inscribed with your favorite number|Hung on the wall|
|13-14|A copper coin|Etched with your favorite flower|Kept in your oldest shoe|
|15-16|A giant's toenail|Pierced with a hot poke|Braided into your hair|
|17-18|Your child's first tooth|Bound in silver thread|Worn as an earring|
|19-20|A sprig of holly|Left under a full moon|Worn around both wrists|

The more complexities that go into making a charm, the stronger the belief in the item itself. Sure, you could wear a coin around your neck, but that doesn’t sound special. It has little to no meaning compared to a coin that has undergone a series of alterations and conditions, those are what give the coin the importance!

# The Seelie and the Unseelie

The first Fey were born from the strongest hopes and doubts. The doubt of the dark, of what lies beyond the threshold of light. The hope of another sunrise and the warmth it brings. These extremely powerful imaginations and superstitions created the Courts of the Fey, the Seelie and the Unseelie.

The Seelie Fey are the more friendly and amicable of the two courts, but still dangerous to deal with. Proper “faerie” creatures belong to this court, like pixies and sprites, along with other creatures tied to nature like fauns and dryads. They are representations of imagination and hopefulness, of the light and warmth in the world. But do not think my dear friend, that they are harmless. They hold the same powers and should be shown the same respect as their counterparts of the Unseelie court, and they are quick to get revenge on those who have wronged them. The court is led by Fey Princes and ultimately the Archfey, the rulers of the Seelie Fey, also known as the Summer Court.

The Unseelie Fey are created from doubts, superstition, and darkness. They are the evil creatures that kidnap children, torture wanderers, and enchant people to dance until they draw their last breath. The Unseelie court is known as the Winter Court, and ruled by Fey Princes and the Archfey. Creatures of horror and ghost stories belong to this court, dopplegangers and banshees, boggles,bogarts,redcaps and the like. Creatures that mean ill, that mean to harm. Creatures that inflict suffering and pain for their own entertainment. Beings of cold and darkness, that take life and leave nothing behind. One should avoid members of this court at all costs, as even some of the Seelie Fey avoid their Unseelie counterparts in fear of their own lives.

# Creating your own Fey creature

So, now we approach the topic of making your own fey creature. Let’s take the example from the silly poem I made up. The Shadowman. Let’s ask some questions to ourselves, first being how did it come to exist? The Shadowman was born from the superstitions of children, that if someone steps on your shadow, you will die a most painful death.

**How did this superstition become stronger?**

Children turned this into a game. The game comprised of one person being the “Shadowman” and the others running away trying to avoid their shadows being stepped on. They played it more and more, until that’s all the kids would talk about when they came home for the evening.  But somehow, even the adults picked up the superstition. Now, they don’t believe you’ll die immediately, but suddenly the whole village has superstitions about people stepping on your shadow. This continual superstition created the entity known as the Shadowman.

**Protection:**

But the adults, being rational people decided that if he’s looking for your shadow the best way to keep it hidden is to keep a candle on your person. Logic being candlelight = lack of shadow, yes? This is the part where you make up a charm for your Fey, something customizable to the creature that ward against it.

**Fleshing out our Fey:**

The next step is to flesh out the folk tale a bit more. Young Jimothy Tompkins was standing in the middle of the square one day and somebody noticed he didn’t have a shadow any more. He fell ill that night and lay in bed for a week, writhing in pain before dying during a new moon. This adds SO MUCH to the story. Now more people believe it, and you can use their belief to influence their actions and mannerisms (providing another layer of narration for you and your players adventure and giving unique character to that little town they’re passing through!). Now we need a description of what the Shadowman looks like. Think of it from the children’s perspective of the story, embellish details a little. He’s tall, gaunt with sunken cheeks and leaking cloudy eyes, stringy black hair and sharp broken teeth, with breath of rotten flesh. He wears a cloak of shadows that whispers your name. His feet are long and wide, and he runs after you trying to step on your shadow. The louder the whispers, the closer he is.

**Support the Fey through literature:**

Write a short poem about the creature, or come up with a folk tale. This solidifies the back bone of the creature, of why it exists. It describes what the creature can do, and why it's good, bad, or dangerous.

# Conclusion:

Imagination and Superstition can give rise to a whole slew of Fey creatures for you to customize for your adventures and campaign. Find ways to include the Fey into your world, make them memorable creatures. Bring folk tales and myths to life. Go beyond the standard Fey, get Wyrd with it.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,18,129,"I've been putting together this hatchet job modification of u/sidecarstories blunderbuss concept to make a weather table.

A note to begin: Firstly, there is a degree of interpretation that must be allowed for in the casting of these dice. If the weather doesn't come on until a later hour, the DM has all artistic license to shape the in-between as appropriate. Secondly, there are weather patterns and assignments that may not work outside of a temperate climate, sorry deserts. Please feel free to limit dice that hamper or simply don't mesh well with your setting. Third and finally, the combination of some aspects may easily create recognizable weather types. High winds and snow are a blizzard. High heat and clear skies can cause a drought. Thunderstorms and crescendo winds are a hurricane. These are my interpretations.

I'm extremely pleased with this set. I'm pleased with the tables, but the Additional Systems section is what I'm most proud of. I've mentioned that this thing I'm calling the Blunderbuss Engine (rolling a full set of 7 dice at once) gives some great soft metrics to qualify the roll - this is where they really shine.

**Disputes:** *Governance: Fealty* furthest from *Defenses: Standing Army* could indicate a brewing rebellion. *Governance: Council* furthest from *Trade: Meddling* could indicate that the local Guilds are fighting the Council for power.

# Utility

Firstly, you can probably **print only Page 1.** This page isn’t necessary for live play.

Of course, you can expand on this concept as you wish: trios of close dice instead of just pairs, multiple pairs of allied elements, or treating a single far-flung die as a cult or splinter group. Keep in mind that players may only be able to track a few of these Affiliations and Disputes at once - you have the full blueprint, they have only clues. Additional Systems - the History Axis and the Hierarchy Axis - will stack more intricacy onto the society you’ve created, but aren’t necessary (especially if the party is already on their way out of town by the time you write all this down.) Still, it can be useful for maturing a settlement you’ve already built.

# Additional Systems

**History Axis:** To take the concept even further, read the dice as a timeline from **left to right**\- elements on the far left came first, while those on the far right are new developments. Affiliations or Disputes can be read the same way. (ex. *Beliefs: Devout to a Neutral God* at the left could mean the town was founded for religious freedom. *Governance: Mandarinate* at the right could mean a recent or impending political revolution.)

**Hierarchy Axis:** While the History Axis can churn up some fascinating complexity in a Town, the Hierarchy Axis proves most useful in larger Cities. In addition to reading the dice left to right, read them from **top to bottom**. The dice at the top represent elements affiliated with high society - either a distinct caste or simply the creme de la creme - and the dice at the bottom represent low-class elements of society. You can divide the dice into individual castes or treat the array of dice as a spectrum of class disparity. (ex. *Crime: Organized* at the top could indicate a secret slavery ring run by social elites. *Crime: Organized* at the bottom could indicate a cell of street urchin assassins.)

=================

*Mission Statement*

*An elegant system for DMs to put muscle on the bones of a Town. Once geography has already been established, this system should address the other player-facing qualities of a Town that give it character. It should be agnostic of the method used to create a town.*

1. *For DMs: though the elements introduced by this system will more actively effect the plot of an adventure, it will not be so rigid as to interfere deeply with campaign canon.*
2. *Elegance: few dice rolls, easy-to-read results, easy to convey and document.*
3. *Muscle: this system will not be about establishing geography, extant people or places, or things to find; it will put those pieces into motion. It should make the world alive- not to feel alive, but really generate a distant and contemporary history. It will address the ways societies move: politics, society, and activity within established geography.*
4. *Player-Facing: There are many qualities of a Town that the players won’t interact with, or care about. Irrigation, writing systems, etc. Each item on the tables will reflect an element of society that can directly impact the players. The Crime and Trade tables were switched for this reason- too much trade*
5. *Other Qualities: race, governance, defences, religion, movements, and factions (though Factions may become a different system altogether.)*
6. *Agnostic: it will not negate any of the features of the Bones/Tarrasque system, and will apply equally well to Towns created without the One-Roll system.*",1,One-Roll Society (Blunderbuss Engine)

They must be submerged in water for an hour a day to let their organs drink. But they can also breathe underwater. 

**Oni**

Partly human, mostly demon. When a human gives in to temptation of a demon, their soul become tasty...edible to demon kin. When their soul is eaten entirely, they begin the transformation into demonhood themselves. It’s a slow process that requires eating a soul and learning the hunger. Unfairly, people, demons, and fairies can claim souls through contracts and just bad luck, causing some children to be born this way. Or, through the shittiness of life, the family that finds you near Ran could sell your soul as well. Life’s not fair, but being an Oni has its perks.

**Goblin**

We’re all goblins on the inside. That part of us that wants to just eat all the junk food, disregard courtesy and walk naked through the streets. The part that looooves alcohol and fucking. That curses and fights and cannot contain themselves. Also the part of us that lets our rooms turn into garbage cans. The part that gets stuck in bed for days at a time, unable to move. The ugly side of human emotion. It’s hard to point to the exact moment, but this can make you a goblin. Even just temporarily. Most goblins though are children stolen by the fae and transformed. 

**Half-Elf**

When the elves were cursed to their life, the humans among them, gaining unnatural life through their closeness with elves, decided to go to the moon. It’s their that they stay, on the dark side. No more are born and they seldom die. On rare occasions, one will come down the moon on a quest. They do not return, as there is currently no known way to get back.

**Unseelie**

Animals with a human form. This happens on occasion. There’s really no other way to explain it.

**Dragon Mutant**

Most of these are cultists. Some though are people who had the misfortune of hearing a dragon talk. The draconic language is a disease and it changes you. Wizards are susceptible to this in their studies, as the Giant language form eons past *is* Draconic. There are the rare breed of human who seek out this change and take on obsessions to try to become dragons themselves. There’s no proof of this working.

**Creation**

This is for all the things that are created, either through humans means, magical means, or the natural means of the world. Robots, genasi, other elemental beings, living spells, and homunculi. No one is sure if they have a soul. Most people hardly have the time to care. 

While Making your Adventurer
---
Keep the following in mind.

**Animism**

There are no gods. But everything has a spirit. From the smallest rock to the tallest mountain. Even emotions and ideas can take on spirits. Anyone can worship a spirit, but Clerics are chosen by a spirit to fulfill some grand scheme, and Paladins are mercenaries to the spirits, learning to worship and abandon spirits through rituals to gain and forfeit powers.

**Oolithian Script**

Wizards make bonds with alien creatures known as familiars so that they can read the ancient scripts and learn magic. But keeping a familiar means fulfilling their often strange demands. Warlocks trade their heart for a monster heart and ride the line between humanity and monstrosity to use magic. Witches marry something to gain its power, like a god spider, or the waning moon. Sorcerers are those who caught a falling star and hold its wish-granting powers to harness magic.

**We Stand on the Shoulders…**

The world is made of, and was inhabited by, Giants. They were immortal beings before the world snakes showed them the passage of time. Their war resulted in one dead snake and many dead giants. The wounded ones escaped into far and distant lands, known as--

**Planes**

The only “other worlds” are the dungeons inside people’s brains, and the Moon. The planes are just regions of land, adventure sites, where the giant’s influence has bled into the land and changed it to be weird and wonderful. 

Welcome to Endsville
---
The last city. Risen up and safe from the chaotic world on the back of the world serpent, Ran. It’s a normal city, like Chicago, or Phily, or NYC. Normal meaning it’s a modern metropolis, made of sprawling neighborhoods and towering monuments. This is where you live. It’s big enough that you can go your whole life without seeing the edge of the snake. 

**Rebel. Burn.**

And it keeps getting bigger. Like any snake, Ran sheds her skin down the length of her massive body, pushing neighborhoods off the side and away from the head, creating this gradation of civilization going back in time through cultures come and gone, going closer and closer to the first human kingdom. 

**Dread Lords**

More and more buildings and neighborhoods are made, while those in power push to grow their neighborhoods towards the head. These people are known as Dread Lords. The rulers of Endsville who wage their cold war. They see all, hear all, and pull the strings for all the going-ons within the city.

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are a well-known but little-researched humanoid in the Prime Material Planes.  Always considered to be brutes and evil they often are overlooked for greater threats like goblins and orcs.  Although, lately, they have started rising up and even organizing, something unheard of in their chaotic kind.  Many questions as to what can be done to counteract the now more frequent and effective ransacking that Gnolls have started doing.

&amp;#x200B;

# Physiology of Gnolls

**Origins of Gnolls**

&amp;#x200B;

Until recently not many knew the old stories as to why Gnolls roam the Material Plane and nowhere else.  Previously thought to be a Goblinoid, mostly due to demeanor, with only similarities to hyenas now we are understanding they are in fact quite closely related to hyenas.

&amp;#x200B;

Tales from older elves and the Hyena Men themselves speak of a dark event that gave birth to the Gnolls.  Accounts say that Yeenoghu, the patron Demon Lord of Gnolls, found his way onto the Prime Material Planes leaving a path devastation in his wake.  Hyenas from all around came to his side picking off the scraps and scavenging what he left behind.  The hyena that followed him began to corrupt and transform turning into creatures much like him and eventually joining him in the destructive march.  Eventually, he was slain and returned to the abyss but left forever the memory of this event in the newly formed armies of the Gnolls.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physical Aesthetics**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls now generally look very similar in these days.  Ranging from 5 to 8 feet tall although usually hunched over looking nearly a foot shorter than their full height.  With Hyena coloring, spotting, faces, ears, and legs they are clearly Hyena origins now that investigations have started.   Gnolls have clawed humanoid hands and variations of fluffy to stiff tails.

&amp;#x200B;

Their jaws, much like Hyena, are very powerful and can be used to crunch bones.  Their teeth while not overly sharp are strong and pointed to be able to crunch and tear off pieces of meat.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sexual Dimorphism**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls have a very interesting distinction between male and female. Most outsiders would mistake a male for a female based purely on physical Aesthetics. Female Gnolls are both larger and have larger genitalia, I trust that I need to go no further. The females are also less aggressive but more likely to be the head of a pack.

Male Gnolls are usually lighter in color but also more aggressive. A gnoll adage is that it's not who's bigger who wins but who's meaner. This attitude, however, does not extend towards females. Most males end up being quite complacent or even subservient to females in a pack.  A female will keep the males in check not only through force but also coercion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Not so Picky Carnivores**

&amp;#x200B;

Hyenas are known scavengers and Gnolls also share the ability to stomach meat too far gone for most other creatures.  However, they desire fresh meat from animals, usually, much more.  They are very skilled hunters and trappers as a result.  When storing food often it is not salted or cooked.  Why bother when it doesn't matter.  They will eat cooked meat all the same but avoid it if possible.  Maggot infested meat is considered a delicacy and given on special occasion.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes them easy to feed in large armies especially mixed with goblin and orc-kind.  With their preference for spoiled meat, they will eat what the others would not.  however, they do cause many more issues in larger armies with their lack of loyalty to other creatures regardless of the cause and horrific hygiene.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dirty and Mangy Mongrels**

&amp;#x200B;

While used as a slang term for Gnolls, the phrase does fit for most standards. They do not bathe, not that they abhor the idea just that it is not an idea that would cross their minds.  With an acute sense of smell, they can pick out rotten or spoiled meat easily.  This gives them the idea that it is a pleasant smell and thus attempt to emulate the smell.  This attracts many flies to them and other small insects, again which a Gnoll finds desirable and other creatures do not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deceptive Strength and Speed**

&amp;#x200B;

While not as strong as a troll or ogre, Gnolls are much stronger than their generally lanky and hunched postures belay.  This very well could be a part of the demonic origins they come from.  Demons also have otherworldly strength with little explanation in a physiological sense.  They are by no means as strong as a demon their size though just stronger than their musculature would normally allow.

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls, however, do not value strength as much as other creatures either but instead value cunning and speed.  Youth will often hold races with no rules of unsportsmanlike conduct.  The pack of young Gnolls scrapping and fighting, tripping and trapping each other in a mad dash from point A to point B all for fun.  They can run decently fast upright but if they drop to all four legs they can sprint although in a much less direct manner much faster.  They do however gain some amount of grip and can run up rough surfaces like creek beds or other rough terrains with their gripping claws.

&amp;#x200B;

**Habitat and Home**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are not usually found in one particular area and are nomadic.  They roam usually temperate areas of the world ransacking and taking what they can.  Their territories in which they roam are usually just large areas in which they are familiar with.  Not particularly territorial they don't lay claim to a taken over settlement just take what they please and move on.  Much unlike goblins or orcs, they don't seek any bigger lot in life and move on to the next meal or shelter.

&amp;#x200B;

If they do build a shelter, usually to wait out a particularly cold winter storm, they simply put wooden structures up in a cave or a small hovel in the forest.  They are not skilled builders thus it's usually just boards, sticks and leaves lased together that won't last more than a few weeks even left undisturbed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monsters of Makeshift and Improvisation**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls do not possess many skills in crafting or forging of weapons. While they could use their sharp demonic like claws well enough, a sword will always do better. They obtain their weapons through their conquests and slain foes. They take what they can quality aside. However, they have become very adept at repairing weapons even during combat.  Your average bar stool wouldn't do much damage during a bar fight but if a Gnoll involved it can become lethal rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Life Cycle**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are not extremely long-lived creatures.  They usually start to become old in their 50's and die of old age in their 60's.  Due to their fast lifestyle more or less in constant conflict, the average age is more akin to 28 to 30.  From pups, they grow fast and reach full adulthood at the age of 5.

&amp;#x200B;

# Social Interactions and Intelligence

&amp;#x200B;

**Intelligence**

&amp;#x200B;

These hyena men are often mistaken as stupid or purely animalistic. It doesn't take long to see that they value cunning when they take the time to savor a kill.  Often they will come up with new and painful ways to torture and eventually slay a captive. They are at nature chaotic beings thus their actions seem irrational to most other creatures. Gnolls often are very well aware of their situation when acting and know very well how to you use chaos to their own advantage. Academic knowledge isn't much use to a nomad who lives life at the end of a sword. However, there are Gnoll spellcasters and practicers of dark arts that use their mental acuity to their advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Language and communication**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls have their own language which seems to stem from the cackling and other sounds from their natural roots the hyena. Their language is very direct with little in the means of adjectives. They do, however, have many contractions, shortening of words, and slang meaning longer ideas to quickly communicate during battle. Their language is a living language that diversifies greatly between packs, although rarely enough for two packs not to be able to understand each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls do not read or write in any language they know and often will know at least three to four. The most common languages they will know outside of their own is Common, Goblin, Orcish, and Minotaur.

&amp;#x200B;

All Gnolls know the word ""kill"" or its equivalent in every language.

&amp;#x200B;

**Children of the Demon Lord, Yeenoghu**

&amp;#x200B;

As with their demonic origins, most follow there Demon Lord as a God. The religion is simple it has one commandment and one only, to kill. This makes them unpredictable allies at best although usually not to their own detriment.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the most devout followers will etch a scar into their hide for each kill they have achieved. Rumors abound that there are a few Gnolls who not only loss count but have no room for more kills. These warriors often referred to as the ""Untouchables"" are extremely rare but also extremely dangerous. None of these warriors were observed during our investigation but we do have reliable 2nd hand accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Matriarchal Rule**

&amp;#x200B;

Despite their demon god being male, females hold the most power in gnoll Society. A pack usually consists of a ruling female and up to 6 males. These packs normally don't become much larger as a female can't keep track of many more males. While this subservience of males is evident, being creatures of Chaos they are not entirely cooperative.

A female will rule a pack as long as she can resisting the need to Bear children.  The birthing process is a particularly painful experience and I would say probably more so than any other creature I've seen.  Thus they avoid children but the call of nature will eventually win over for the Gnolls to prevail biologically.

&amp;#x200B;

Matriarchs serve the much-needed role of a guiding voice in the chaos.  Males are wilder and without so merging holding them back they very well could get themselves into trouble.  When a Matriarch is killed with no immediate heir, the Gnoll band can quickly become disjointed and lose any sense of direction or plans they had.

&amp;#x200B;

**Raised in the Pack**

&amp;#x200B;

All Gnoll children are raised by a singular appointed male in the group.  The male is usually suited to this by being older or unable to fight as well.  Children learn not only the ways of the pack but also their hunting and trapping skills.  As creatures of Chaos teaching is more of an individualized experience usually through tough lessons and failure.  Mentors have been known to kill a child during raising due to giving them more than they can chew.

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls have no sense of bloodline as many sentient creatures.  They do not favor or consider children, siblings, or parents in any way different from another Gnoll.  Genetically this should cause problems but as of yet the effects of inter-breeding is unseen.  I wouldn't understand how they would be immune to such things, as even demons are aware of such dangers.  Instead, they consider the pack to be a family unit and while disagreements can occur they are ultimately loyal to each other.  Succession is seen as a necessary change of guard and is not treated as a vie for power.

&amp;#x200B;

**Succession**

&amp;#x200B;

Female Gnolls hold leadership by showing that they are more cunning, quicker, and stronger.  This is done in a battle to the death between the Matriarch and a challenger.  When a female reaches the age of maturity, around 5 years old either she will challenge her mother or leave to form or take over a new pack.

&amp;#x200B;

The fight is a 1 on 1 with any weapon or tool within reach at the time of the fight.  Often these fights are spontaneous and an ambush in favor of the challenger.  Matriarchs who live the longest seem to not trust other females in the slightest.

&amp;#x200B;

Males have been known to challenge but this is a rare occurrence.  While a male is unlikely to win is the easiest answer they often are lost without proper leadership.  These male leaders never seem to last long.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflict Between Packs**

&amp;#x200B;

Packs represent territories not just for hunting grounds but also killing rights.  Packs will seldom come to blows unless the Matriarchs feel they could absorb the other clan for their benefit.  This, of course, is rare as they risk being outnumbered and unable to control so many males.  If fights do break out they can be brutal and eventually end up in a merger anyway.  The fights will usually lead to significant losses on both sides and a singular pack much smaller than before.

&amp;#x200B;

# Interactions with Other Creatures

&amp;#x200B;

**Bugs are no Bother**

&amp;#x200B;

Flies and other insects do not bother them especially since they are followed by many of them.  Their tough hides and thick wiry fur protect them from most insects.  This makes them particularly numb to the idea of a threat from insects regardless of size.

&amp;#x200B;

**Minotaurs**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls and Minotaurs have a general hatred for each other largely based on the same rivalry their demon lords have.  Baphomet and Yeenoghu have hated each other and constantly attack or plot against each other.  While Minotaurs are usually physically more opposing and have mental superiority, they have much fewer numbers and rarely can anyone predict chaos.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goblins, Orcs, Trolls, and Giants**

&amp;#x200B;

Many of these races often work together in large armies when conflicts of large scale occur in a region.  Gnolls do not seek out these conflicts or incite them but are often very eager to join in a fight.  They are not loyal to or necessarily care about the cause of an army.  They do however get along with these creatures well for their lust for violence.  Gnolls, unlike Orcs, very rarely abuse goblins or other smaller creatures but will kill one if the mood suits them.  This again makes them unpredictable but useful allies.  As long as there are things to be killed a Gnoll band may join that army.

&amp;#x200B;

**Humans, Elves and other civilized races**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are often avoided and only seen in combat either through wars, highway ambushes, or conflict in the wilderness.  It is generally regarded by most civilizations that they are dangerous yet easy to avoid creatures.  Gnolls don't regard any sentient race as anything but another lamb to the slaughter.  However, they are smart enough to recognize a formidable foe when they see one and will either change tactics or avoid a force strong or large enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Untrainable Soldiers**

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned they are eager to join in a fight for one side or another.  However, they do not and will not take orders regardless of the situation.  They can be intimidated into cooperation, or even comply by understanding tactical advantage.  They always fight in their own way and will never listen to lessons on fighting.  Even other Gnolls do not attempt to teach a cub how to fight as they themselves know the fruitless task such a lesson would be.  Instead, they rely on their brutality, instincts, and wit to make it through a fight.  Given how they are often the victors of combat at even odds, it's hard to argue with results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demons**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are eager to aid and follow demons.  Not because they ally with the demon as much as a demon and a Gnoll have much in common as far as motivations go.  Gnoll worshipers of Yeenoghu are often granted the power to call in such demons when in great favor.  In the presence of a demon, Gnoll bloodlust can heighten giving them even more strength and speed in the form of some moral or excitement.

&amp;#x200B;

# Variations

&amp;#x200B;

**Hyena Men**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are most often Hyena Men that we know of in the temperate climates of the Material Plane.  They are usually mottled grey or brown and always with Black spots.  Their postures are usually hunched forward but even then they can be much taller than a human or even orc.  Packs usually consist of 1 to 2 females (1 being adolescent) and 5 to 8 males.  Rarely do they have more than 2 children present with them.  With yellow sharp teeth and even more yellow burning eyes these carnivores can be intimidating.

&amp;#x200B;

**Flinds**

&amp;#x200B;

Flinds are Gnolls that are shorter and stronger than their Gnoll brethren.  Flinds are rare but a naturally occurring genetic phenomenon.  They usually end of being the leader of their packs regardless of gender, however, they are most often females anyway.  This birth rate of a Flind is about 1 in 40,000 but the male to female ratio of Flinds is easily 3/1.  Some Gnolls believe this is a gift from Yeenoghu for their ruthless slaughter.  Flinds usually have red eyes although occasionally they will be yellow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Untouchables**

&amp;#x200B;

these Gnolls are extremely rare.  Many Gnolls strive to achieve this goal and most who live full lives often still don't come close.  As previously mentioned these gnolls are highly skilled warriors counting thousands in their kill counts etched into their bodies.  Rumors say that until their eyes glow a ghostly green they are not untouchable.  When they become Untouchable their hides thicken to the point of resisting spears, and their strength and speed increase 10 fold.  So the legend says at least.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demon Spawn**

&amp;#x200B;

Some Gnoll Matriarchs desire Half-Demon Gnoll children to further their tribes kill count.  This demon spawn is usually crossed with a powerful demon such as a Glaberazu or Balor.  This ""Blessing"" as they call it is extremely rare and often at the behest of Yeenoghu himself.  Standing easily 10 feet tall often they will have 4 arms and be soot black in fur coloration.  They are not ever Matriarchs of families and live for hundreds of years desiring nothing but the murder of other creatures.  They are loyal to the pack and if their pack is decimated often they will wander alone continuing the ""prayers"" to Yeenoghu.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gnoll Clerics and Warlocks of Yeenoghu**

&amp;#x200B;

While Yeenoghu has no such clerical power as many deities do he can, however, grant a devout worshiper with demonic strength and magic.  This is much akin to how a warlock makes a pact for power, the clerics do so with utter devotion.  Thus there are many warlocks and clerics of Yeenoghu with little distinction between the 2.  Both paths are rewarded with red glowing eyes and their teeth become crimson.  They are also usually male and thus hardly ever Matriarchs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gnolls of Obad-Hai**

&amp;#x200B;

Some Gnolls have broken the bond of violence to live as one with nature under the blessing of the God of Nature.  These gnolls are purely hunters or trappers living off the land and protecting their often forest homes as a ranger would.  They are not goodly but instead strictly interested in the protection of the forest akin to a Druid. Some packs have taken this path but usually, they are solitary males.

&amp;#x200B;

# DM's Notes

&amp;#x200B;

**How to use them**

&amp;#x200B;

Gnolls are another monster on the list of creatures to fight on the road for most DM's.  However, they are best used in my opinion as a great way to put some variety into fights when fighting other creatures.  I personally like Gnolls very much and use them often especially for lower level encounters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steal My Idea**

&amp;#x200B;

Not often do I have a campaign idea but the ""Rise of Yeenoghu"" is one I've been working on for the better part of 10 years.  There are a few things about this campaign to explain and you can take it from there.

&amp;#x200B;

* Yeenoghu through some means has finally bested and slain Baphomet for good thus releasing Minotaurs of his influence.  Yeenoghu offers glory for those Minotaurs who are willing to join his cause in making the Prime Material his playground once again

&amp;#x200B;

* A female Matriarch who is an Untouchable becomes the wife or consort of Yeenoghu.  With a female for the first time gaining the admiration of the ever bloodthirsty Lord of Murder she is able to focus Yeenoghu as a weapon as he never had a direction before

&amp;#x200B;

* Gnolls now have started banding together for a greater cause which is the coming of Yeenoghu once again.  Packs start becoming allied mega-packs that ransack whole cities instead of small villages.  This is a tenuous agreement that all hinges on the coordination and coercion from the high Matriarch as she is called who keeps many lieutenant Matriarchs involved and informed.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many ways in which the Gnolls fail and even by their own hand but I have found this to be a fun premise to subvert the expectations of what we think of about Gnolls.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,11,71,"Most fantasy worlds are trapped in a perpetual state of medieval stasis. This is perfectly fine for the most part until you start to consider how a world might have changed due to the introduction of magic. A world like Forgotten Realms has existed for millennia, and even with thousands of level 20 characters romping through it, hardly anything has changed. The majority of people still live a peasant lifestyle, with very few people ever experiencing magic ever in their lives. To me, it feels like they created the Forgotten Realms, and other Dnd worlds and then added magic onto it, instead of building it from the ground up with magic in mind. 

I do want to start off by saying, there is nothing wrong with these worlds. Generic fantasy with centuries of backstory is engaging and simply fun. We don't need to think about the mechanics of flaming lizard flight to simply enjoy the world. But, I like having an element of verisimilitude in my settings, and I am a big fan of Brandon Sanderson's worlds. These worlds are built with magic being an integral part of the setting during construction and helps to create the mythos, religion, and ideology of its inhabitants. Today I would like to build a world from the ground up, accounting for the baseline of Magic that is present in Dnd. How exactly would a world change with access to spells that raise the dead, an infinite supply of cantrips, and occasionally the power of a Wish?

#The Basics of Magic

When creating a new world, especially one that is going to be compatible with Dnd, you need to have a few assumptions about the world in order to help you build it. The first thing we need to understand is magic itself. Is magic a swirling aether in another realm that wizards draw power from? Is it energy we draw from ourselves, or is magic only unlocked by doing kung fu to manipulate the air around you? /u/Mimi-ion has started an excellent discussion around magic in his post [""A Theory of Magic""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/aky6cn/a_theory_of_magic/), which talks more about magic, analyzing it from a scientific lens. For the sake of this post, let's start by defining what exactly magic is in Dnd.

Magic in Dungeons and Dragons is Vanican in nature. What this means is you learn very specific spells that do close to the exact same thing every time you cast it, and after you cast it you ""forget"" the spell and must spend some time memorizing it again. [The TV Tropes article about Vanican magic is an excellent place to learn more about this.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic) 5th edition changed this slightly by allowing spellcasters to still remember their spells after they cast them, but eventually, they would run out of spell slots. The central idea behind this is that spells (specifically wizard spells) are memorized and stored in the brain, and when cast would exhaust the wizard and even be forgotten. This necessitates the use of spellbooks and writing spells down, as the physical act of casting a spell is amnesia-inducing. 

With one segment of magic defined, the next part would be to consider how many people are capable of arcane magic. Let's start with the assumption that 1/100 people are magically capable. This brings up another question, as to whether magic is genetic or purely random. Both options lead to very interesting worldbuilding scenarios. Let's take a middle of the road approach and say that magic is both genetic and random. You are more likely to have a magic user if you have a kid with someone else who can cast spells, but it is ultimately random and some hillbilly in the mountains can have a very destructive sorcerer even with no trace of magic in their blood. 

#The Average Wizard

Another thing that needs to be determined about magic is the average level of wizards in this world. How common are wizarding schools? With magic being such an important thing to have, especially in a world as dangerous as the typical Dnd world, magic becomes doubly important. Lots of funding would go into teaching wizards how to better harness their spells. How difficult is magic to learn? Even with the best schools and funding, magic might be so difficult to understand, that competency past first level is considered outstanding. Following the Exp charts in the PHB, we can use these numbers to reach some conclusions. 

1st Level: 300 Exp
2nd Level: 900 Exp
3rd Level: 2,700 Exp
4th Level: 6,500 Exp
5th Level: 14,000 Exp

With these charts we can see that going from 2nd level to 3rd level is three times as difficult as going from 1st level to 2nd level. Going from 3rd to 4th is three times as difficult again, and 4th to 5th is about three times as difficult again. This means that getting to 5th level requires you to level up from 1st to 2nd level approximately 46 times. (14,000/300). Even with good schools, that much schooling would require most of your life to reach 5th level. Getting to 2nd level is similar to getting your associates degree, whereas getting to 3rd would require a Ph.D. 1.77% of the USA has a doctorate degree, and this is in a world without Dragons and Beholders. I do believe that in a fantasy world, even with a huge focus on education, most magic users would not get to 3rd level. 



#Conclusion

Let's recap: Magic in Dnd is a Vanican system, which requires memorization and diligent study. 1/100 people are magical in nature, and it is both genetic and random. The average level of wizards is 1st to 2nd level. With only 3 details figured out about this world, we can already begin to understand so much more about it. The most magic the average person would see is cantrips and 1st level spells. Wizarding colleges would spring up in the bigger cities, and once the wizards have spent a minimum of 2 years there they would go back to their hometowns and help them in any way they can. Magic is exhausting, and dangerous, and may lead to mental conditions after an extended period of use. Nobility has sprung up around the magic bloodline, and those born outside of the noble house would be treated similarly to muggle-born in Harry Potter. Next week, I am going to talk about what spells would shape society, and how powerful cantrips really are. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,185,"This is the third entry in my Spells &amp; Storytelling series! This one took a particularly long time, as 2nd-level spells are chock full of potential when it comes to storytelling opportunities. I also hit the 400000 character cap and had to split it into 2 posts. Achievement unlocked! The second part will be posted next week.

[Part 1 of the series focused on cantrips](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9ras26/how_cantrips_changed_the_world_spells/), and [part 2 focused on 1st-level spells](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a3et7l/the_first_level_of_magic_spells_storytelling_part/).

# Intro &amp; Assumptions

As mentioned in part 1, **the below descriptions assume a mid-to-high magic setting**, which D&amp;D 5E is largely designed for. It also assumes the ability of artificers (sometimes referred to as enchanters) to create permanent or semi-permanent effects using skills or magic that aren't specifically outlined by RAW.

As with anything, this is largely up to the DM as the storyteller. Additionally, as mentioned before, most damage-based spells have been left out, both for the sake of time, and since their effects (and storytelling impacts) should be more straight-forward and uniform.

I've also decided to add what's effectively a tl;dr for each spell entry, in the form of ***Story Tags***. Rather than have to read through all of my ideas, hopefully these tags will give readers an easy way to get a general sense of how the spell impacts setting &amp; story, and you can dig in from there. Note: the tag ""*Arms Race""* implies that the spell creates an interesting back-and-forth dynamic, usually between opposing professions. These tags are by no means exhaustive, and any suggested additions/changes are much appreciated!

Lastly, at this point I've come up with a few terms that describe specific types of spell-casters you may not see in most WotC books. *Aurans* are effectively those using divination spells to enhance their vision (mostly in the form of *detect magic*), while *Obfuscators* are the opposite, those who are able to mask magical effects (and hide from Aurans). *Augurs or Seers* are those who use divination more to give hints about folks' fortunes, and are likely looked down upon by Aurans professionally. *Mage* would refer to more arcane spell-casters, like Wizards, Sorcerers, Warlocks and Bards specifically.

It's also clear that magical security, communications, magically-augmented laborers and explorers all have many levels of professions of their own (though I haven't particularly named those yet). I think these are a rich source of inspiration for unique NPC's in our games, story hooks, and perhaps backgrounds for our players to use as well.

# 2nd-level Spells : A Primer

Second level spells become available at character level 3, which is when most spell-casting characters go through *a rite of passage*. In game terms, this usually comes in the form of acquiring a subclass. Due to such rites of passage, we might consider that *2nd-level spells lie out of reach of most common folk*, who are level 0-1. This means 2nd-level spells are used more often by specialists or skilled spell casters, though they can also be found in the form of scrolls and potions instead. **This makes such scrolls and potions of this level (and higher) considerably more valuable.**

They may be less prevalent than cantrips and 1st-level spells, but these spells are still likely to be common place in your world! Their impacts are also greater, so even though they're not as common, their impact is still quite high on our settings and the stories we tell.

Without further adieu, lets get into it!

[ACID ARROW](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/acid-arrow)

* A favorite of thieves and explorers, Melf's Acid Arrow (or simply Acid Arrow) was designed so that it can target non-living AS WELL AS living beings (as opposed to most lower-level acid-conjuring spells). This gives the spell utility both in and out of combat.
* Locked doors and treasure chests can be more easily broken into, barricades may be weakened, ropes burned, and clothing altogether unmade (as per comments on acid cantrips in part 1).
* In places having to deal with burglars utilizing Acid Arrow for break-ins, doors and containers may be lined with thick leather or monster-hide to effectively give it a bit more resistance to the effects of the acid.
* Acid-Arrow can also be used in construction, demolition, or item creation, as you never know when something might need to be chemically-melted!
* ***Story Tag: Break-ins, Security, Industry***

[ALTER SELF](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/alter-self) &amp; [INVISIBILITY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility)

* While *Alter Self* is in the same vein as Disguise Self (level 1),this is a transmutation spell rather than an illusion. This means a character is able to actually shape-shift into someone else, including acquiring their voice!
* Luckily for security professionals, this spell isn't quite as prevalent as Disguise Self. However, it nonetheless has served to increase paranoia in political circles and among the nobility, where one's identity and credibility is of utmost importance.
* The main security measure used to detect Altered creatures is Detect Magic. This serves to alert security that a specific individual is under the effects of a transmutation spell, and as such they would stand out and be questioned.
* It takes more work and time to obfuscate ones' magical signature to avoid Detect Magic, but it can be done!
* The spell *Invisibility* has a similar impact and *Alter Self,* and is still easily-detected by Aurans, generally speaking.
* In a more pragmatic sense, the *Aquatic Adaptation* of Alter Self is extremely helpful to any coastal people, fisherfolk, sailors, and anyone frequenting watery environments. Being able to breath underwater for an hour would allow spellcasters (or anyone with the proper scroll) to explore hidden grottoes, ship-wrecks, and hunt/gather underwater for extended periods, enabling them to find rare plants and other objects. As such, you could have some very interesting Merchants that utilize this spell.
* The Aquatic Adaptation could also be used to gain access to hidden chambers and hideouts not otherwise available.

[ANIMAL MESSENGER](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-messenger)

* Despite being a less-common spell, this one has the potential to totally change long-distance communication in your world. Since it's a ritual spell, Druids, Bards or Rangers with this spell can easily make a living with it.
* *Animal Messenger Posts effectively act like the Post Office does in our world.* More prominent towns are likely to have stronger Druids, Bards, or Rangers manning the posts, and so they can send animals further distances (higher level casting of the spell). Longer-distance messages run a premium cost.
* One limitation of the spell is that the animals can only be sent to ""a location, which you must have visited"". As such, Animal Messengers are known to travel to many places, to further improve the range of their services. *Some Messengers are known to join adventuring bands, armies, or entertainment troupes for the purpose of expanding the reach of their animal messengers, which they can charge more money for providing.*
* Guilds are established to further increase the effectiveness of Animal Messenger services as well. If a message is to be kept secret, this requires that the animal ends up at the right person's doorstep, and couriers may be required in addition to animal messengers. Since animals tend to have to follow a basic description of the recipients, names are also sent to the receiving Post's guild-master, who can then more precisely guide the creature to its intended target. Additionally, since the range of the spell is limited by default to 50 miles (for flying creatures), sometimes it must be relayed along multiple posts to reach its final destination.
* Animal Messengers may be shot down, stolen, or otherwise intercepted, as the Tiny beast relaying the message is temporarily under a form of enchantment. This means that magic can be detected on the creature by Augers. An easy means of disrupting the business of a local town is for brigands to shoot down any Animal Messengers leaving or entering the place, demanding payment to stop the aggression. In some places this type of crime is punishable by death, as Animal Messengers could be the only means of local lords or armies to communicate vital information.
* Though they're not nearly as fast in delivering their messages, squirrels and other small mammals are often used instead of birds, as they're easier to hide from prying eyes, scurrying through underbrush and in subterranean tunnels to deliver their messages!
* ***Story Tags: Communication, Economy, Guilds, Military, Professions (Messenger), Exploration***

[ARCANE LOCK](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-lock) \+ [KNOCK](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/knock)

* Another favorite of security professionals, Arcane Lock largely ensures that only the most determined and skilled thieves are able to break and enter a property, or a specific container. This not only complicates the locking mechanisms, but strengthens the door or container considerably! (DC +10 to break open or unlock)
* Since the spell lasts until it's dispelled, professionals are often called in to create Arcane Locks on specific doors and containers, usually along with Contingency spells and the setting of magical traps to punish those who would attempt to break in.
* Since the spell is semi-permanent and requires 25 GP worth of gold dust to cast, it also usually comes with a much higher cost. As such, it's most often limited to Merchant and Noble houses, military complexes, government buildings, and of course, any place frequented by Wizards who want to secure their own belongings.
* The home of any wizard is likely to be completely locked down by this spell. Only those with the Wizard's password are granted entry, as well as those they may consider trusted enough for entry (which is part of the casting of the spell). Discovering a wizard's password is sometimes of great importance when attempting to get access to their homes or information they may have. Smarter wizards have multiple passwords for various levels of access in their homes.
* While the Knock spell directly counters any Arcane Lock for 10 minutes, it's often not enough in itself to get through a highly-secured arcane-locked building, due to the fact that such locks may be paired with traps, surveillance, or simply multiple layers of locks that drain the magical resources of the thief.
* The interplay between Knock and Arcane Lock is, of course, ultimately a matter of resources available, both to those trying to lock down their property, and those attempting to do the stealing.

[ARCANIST'S MAGIC AURA](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcanists-magic-aura)

* AKA ""Nystul's Magic Aura"", this spell is the bread-and-butter for Obfuscators, as it allows them to bypass the *Detect Magic* spell entirely, as well as *Detect Evil and Good*. As such, use of the spell for specific purposes almost always demands a high price.
* The Obfuscator can not only make a creature or item appear non-magical, it can change the nature or appearance of a magical aura. It can also make a mundane item or creature appear magical, thereby granting them ability to create magical distractions from their own presence.
* In order to obfuscate the presence of a familiar, the creature can have its aura changed to a Beast. In this manner, the *Detect Evil and Good* spell will no longer work on it.
* For a much higher cost, an Obfuscator can cast this spell on a creature or object every day for 30 days, which creates a semi-permanent effect that will last until it's dispelled. Some of the most renown Arcane Tricksters utilize this on themselves to make themselves appear Non-Magical, while using *Alter Self* to shapeshift and mimic other people. Such individuals are capable of causing a great deal of social chaos!
* Nystul/Arcanist's Magic Aura is the absolute bane of Augurs and Seers throughout the realms.
* ***Story Tags: Legendary Thieves, Break-ins, Security, Professions (Obfuscator), Arms Race***

[AUGURY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury)

* Augury is one of the baseline spells that allow for the Divination profession in the world. With this magic, Seers and Augers are able to help others get a sense of foreknowledge related to specific questions they may have.
* Though Augury is a ritual, it can be used quite often. However, the accuracy of the spell decreases with subsequent casting. While more responsible and moral Augurs will take this into account, and may only give 2-3 readings per day, charlatans will continue to cast the spell beyond its intended use, and simply spin any resulting inaccuracies.
* Augury may have a high demand in places where the gods are more well-respected, where their will is highly sought-after. The opposite is also true, so Seers may also be cast out or even hunted down in places where the gods are seen with suspicion or even hate.
* A certain amount of skill is required for Augury to provide helpful information, as the result for most courses of action is, in fact, ""Both good and bad"". The querent, who is asking for guidance, often needs to be interviewed briefly so that the Augur can help guide them to a more exact question. In this way, they can be told that the specific result will be ""Good"" or ""Bad"".
* Due to the potential widespread use of the spell, some towns and cities may even have Divination Guilds in place to ensure that those utilizing Augury are doing so in a responsible manner.
* ***Story Tags: Charlatans, Superstition, Religion, Professions (Seer / Diviner, Charlatan), Guilds***

[BEAST SENSE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/beast-sense)

* This spell effectively allows an animal companion, such as those charmed by Animal Friendship, to serve as a familiar, with the caster able to look through their beast's eyes and ears as needed.
* *Beast Sense*  skirts around the *Detect Evil and Good* spell, since these creatures are beasts and not celestial, fey, fiend, aberration or undead. Accordingly, Druids and Rangers are looked to as potential spies in towns and cities, sometimes even moreso than Mages.
* Generally speaking, in places with stronger security, all creatures are viewed with suspicion, so pets and rodents are completely barred from the premises.
* ***Story Tags: Spies, Security***

[CALM EMOTIONS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/calm-emotions)

* While adventurers often utilize this spell to prevent conflict or to dispel enchantments on their allies, it's also used populated areas for a variety of purposes.
* A common use of this enchantment, sometimes colloquially called ""Tranquility"", is to imbue a large chamber with a calm atmosphere where people find it far more difficult to get into squabbles. This is particularly useful in Courts and other houses of law, in jails and prisons to suppress belligerent inmates, as well as royal courts, not only as a first line of defense against assassination attempts for important leaders, but to encourage more cooperation than may otherwise be possible when political tensions mount.
* ""Tranquility"" is also a highly-effective means of crowd-control and keeping the peace in more densely-populated areas. As such, scrolls of tranquility are often kept in guard houses in the event of civil uprising or gang violence in the streets. Larger towns and major cities often seek out Peace-Keepers who know this spell by heart in order to have such capabilities at the ready at all times.
* ***Story Tags: Law Enforcement, Enchanting Buildings, Security***

[CONTINUAL FLAME](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/continual-flame)

* Continual flames are often ubiquitous in major cities, as they can only be quelled by being magically dispelled. This reduces the need for fuel in the form of oil, wood or other combustibles, as well as costs for paying fire-keepers and torch-bearers in big cities or large noble houses.
* Since these flames produce no heat, they're often employed in areas sensitive to fire, such as mansions and forest homes, as needs permit.
* Some wizards and clerics who know this spell have found a living by traveling to places requiring such enchantments, and setting them up for people of all levels of society, for usually-reasonable prices.
* Since the flame produced by the spell requires no fuel and cannot be quenched, it may also be utilized underwater. Such a capability, especially in conjunction with other magic spells, have allowed for much-improved aquatic habitats and explorations, as underwater environments are frequently very dark.
* ***Story Tags: Security, Economy, Professions (""Person who adds cool magic stuff to your house""), Underwater***

[DARKVISION](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkvision)

* A must-have for many adventuring parties, especially those without natural darkvision, this spell also has a high demand in cities, the military, and even among academics and craftsfolk the world over.
* Guard patrols commonly utilize darkvision to attract less attention to themselves by ne'r-do-wells at night, and to improve their visual range from atop guard towers, castle walls and the like.
* Folk with naturally-occurring darkvision such as elves, gnomes, and dwarves, often used their sight as a distinct advantage against human and dragonborn foes, particularly by setting up attacks and ambushes at night. This has forced many armies to work around this, and employ the use of the Darkvision spell to augment their forces' awareness and to prevent such ambushes. The same is true of guards in noble houses, as well as in small towns and villages.
* Academic-types such as archaeologists who wish to explore dark ruins without attracting the ire of local monsters to such a primitive thing as torchlight place great value on this spell.
* Many artisans enjoy working by night may employ (or pay for) darkvision as well, as they prefer the visual greyscale tones that the spell provides. The quivering shadows produced by flame may also prove distracting to their work, versus the more-natural and tranquil vision of the spell.
* ***Story Tags: Professions, Crafting, Military, Law Enforcement, Exploration***

[DETECT THOUGHTS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts)

* The ability to detect the thoughts of others through arcane means creates an array of possibilities and problems in mostly-medieval society.
* On the positive side, investigators, law enforcement, Judges and other truth-seekers are all able to utilize this ability to discover the plots and deeds of criminals, charlatans and even tyrants themselves in an effort to maintain balance and goodness in the world.
* On the other hand, Bounty-Hunters, interrogators and Tormentors (military and otherwise), as well as criminals and tyrants themselves are able to utilize such magic to find the weaknesses of their enemies, to learn and exploit their secrets, and to maintain control over their domains.
* Accordingly, those with important secrets have a very high demand on magic (scrolls, equipment, or spells) that can protect them from their minds being combed for information. Some have been known to travel to dangerous realms such as the Underdark and the Astral plane to make deals with powerful and usually-evil creatures, such as Illithid and Neogi, to acquire such capabilities.
* In the realm of law, trusted judges who are able to utilize this ability can very easily get to the truth of a specific matter, and if not, are able to quickly ascertain whether or someone is lying in their courtroom.
* ***Story Tags: Law, Investigation, Interrogation, Professions (Judge/Adjudicator, Investigator, Bounty Hunter), Arms Race***

[ENHANCE ABILITY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/enhance-ability)

* Famous heroes may be able to enhance their own abilities in their adventures, but for common folk, this spell could potentially alter their daily lives and expectations even more.
* Businesses and industries requiring physical labor may hire spell-casters, or purchase scrolls, to augment the Constitution and Strength of a few skilled, trusted employees, rather than hiring a group of laborers to do the same job. In conjunction with other labor-saving spells, such as Floating Disk, as well as other high-magic technologies, a single laborer could easily do the same work as 5 people using a cart to load/unload supplies and materials.
* Such potential could create unique competition between magic-based businesses and traditional ones, especially in places where resources are scarce. However, in cities where basic survival and comforts are assured (likely also through magical means), these capabilities are entirely liberating, and allow more common folk to pursue passions in the arts, craftsmanship, worship, study, or simply focus on raising their families.
* Enhancing ones Dexterity and Intelligence would have similar effects, but more in the realms of artisanship, allowing skilled crafters to achieve their highest potentials, and for academics to more fully investigate the arcane mysteries. Such enhancements may lead to new discoveries and novel inventions the world hasn't yet seen.
* Augmenting one's Charisma and Wisdom are often utilized by shop and inn keepers, politicians, as well as criminals, in order to more easily ingratiate themselves with their patrons and marks. Guard captains and mercenaries with higher Wisdom are far more aware of their surroundings, which makes this a popular spell to use when protecting VIP's, or when honing in on a long-sought target.
* ***Story Tags: Labor and Industry, Artisanship, Charlatans***

[ENLARGE/REDUCE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/enlarge-reduce)

* While this spell could be quite powerful in its effects, the fact that it only lasts a minute means that folk have had to become quite clever in its use to get the most out of it.
* Temporarily enlarging a crafts person's important projects, particularly those requiring fine detail can allow them to create some of the most intricately-carved and designed items in the world, when planned out properly. Some say that the sages of old who created many of the most powerful magic items used such capabilities to etch runes in immensely fine detail in order to create persistent enchantments and other effects. This was done by blowing the object up to twice it's size, perhaps even larger, and manipulating it before it returned to its former state.
* Temporarily reducing not only the size but the weight of objects and creatures has many utilitarian uses as well. Thieves' guilds commonly use this spell to sneak carts loaded with goods, people, or both, through small crevices and into hidden chambers so they can't be easily tracked down. Wizards and Sorcerers use this spell in conjunction with other enchantments for security reasons - such as doors that will only open for very tiny, very light creatures who know a particular magical phrase.
* At the more mundane level, it has been used in gladiatorial combat and other performances to please crowds and create stories told across the lands, where halflings become ""Fullings"", twice their size, who then wrestle ""Smalliath"" to the ground, only for them to pop back into their original forms a minute later, to the glee of the onlookers.
* ***Story Tags: Artisanship, Security, Break-Ins, Entertainment***

[FIND STEED](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-steed)

* For champions of the realms, the acquisition of this spell completely revolutionizes their world, and accordingly, the lives of those around them, allowing them to summon highly-intelligent, telepathically-bound creatures which they can use with great effectiveness, at will.
* Paladins utilizing such steeds are commonly looked to for help, with suspicion, or outright terror, depending on the nature of their steed, and as such stories tend to swirl around them, and linger in the wake of their passing.
* Those with magical steeds are often recruited into armies or mercenary groups, as they can cover great distances with no concern for the health of the creature they ride. Similarly, merchant and noble houses have been known to pay premium amounts of gold and platinum for Paladins of all sorts to deliver extremely important messages as quickly as possible across longer distances, and through more dangerous climes.
* Similarly, clever champions are also able to acquire information from up to a mile away from their steed through their telepathic bond, sometimes sending them far into enemy territory as magical scouts. To counter this, the spell Detect Good and Evil, which senses the presence of celestials, fey and fiends, is vital to picking out such magical steeds from a group of normal ones, as they could actually be enemy spies.
* ***Story Tags: Communication, Military, Professions (Messenger), Spies***

[FIND TRAPS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-traps)

* This spell, while potentially quite helpful to ne'r-do-wells and explorers, has limitations which make it useful to only the most clever thieves and adventurers.
* One key aspect of the spell is that it only reveals the presence of intentional traps within eye-sight. Accordingly, most security measures involving mechanical traps are often hidden beneath floorboards, around corners, and behind ceiling tiles to make this detection entirely ineffective.
* What the spell IS good for is detecting the presence of magical protective barriers and alarm systems, which often radiate their magic around entire rooms, doorways, windows and walls, such as magical Alarms, Contingency spells, and Glyphs of Warding.
* Additionally, the detection also reveals the general nature of the danger posed by the Glyph or Contingency, which is vital when planning how to get around these barriers, which are often permanent until triggered or dispelled. As such, ""Find Traps"" is often used over a period of time and with a great deal of patience to evaluate security and means of getting around it.
* The same is true for explorers of hidden and often-dangerous ruins, which are often dense with protective glyphs with unknown effects.

# Origins

Summon Greater Demon allows the caster to pull from the Abyss a single, significantly stronger demon than its 3rd level counterpart – Summon Lesser Demons. In doing so it even provides a modicum of control over the demon summoned, though there always remains some threat of the demon shucking its dominion and turning on its would be master.

Scholars can generally agree that the first usages of Summon Greater Demon on Toril was from it being passed down from Pact Master to Warlock. It’s theorised this would have been a natural progression from Summon Lesser Demons’ short comings – likely involving a new or larger sacrifice to a pact master in exchange for the increase in power. There’s been at least one text translated containing reference to a Warlock that was punished for mastering this spell without her pact master's consent. Although there’s some disagreement on whether or not the spell originated from a single layer of the Nine or was distributed via many, it’s certain that it cropped up in the material plane from multiple sources. The dangerous nature of the spell likely meaning that many of those casters were ultimately felled by their own summonings and their souls claimed to serve whichever layer.

Whatever the spells exact origin on Toril, little is known about how it came into being in the Hells in the first place - and scholars are generally disinclined to probe much deeper..

&amp;#x200B;

# Components

Summon Greater Demon only takes an Action to cast. That's a big investment at the start of combat, yet it's pretty amazing as far as summoning spells go. Compared to Conjure Elemental (a similar CR, with a 'friendly' summon) which takes a full min to cast. The caster will need to expend their concentration to maintain SGD and it can be cast up to 60ft at a point the caster can see. The spell must be cast at a minimum of 4th level, a significant sacrifice for a warlock that has precious few castings, though wizards so inclined have been known to learn it too. The spell requires Verbal and Somatic with the optional inclusion of a Material component \~ a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours.\~

The blood isn’t strictly required and has no cost in gold associated but a caster will usually seek it out when available as they can gain a modicum of additional protection by the inclusion of a blood circle.

&amp;#x200B;

# Demons available:

There's no comprehensible reason anyone would summon something below CR4 other than possibly a CR1 Quasit (utility, scout).

CR4: Babau (combat, control), Dybbuk (utility, possession, combat), Shadow Demon (combat, scout)

CR5: Barlgura (combat, scout, control), Tanarukk (combat)

CR6 (max CR available for warlocks): Chasme (combat, control), Vrock (combat, stun)

CR8 (worthy mention for Wizards): Shoosuva (combat, paralyse)

&amp;#x200B;

# Casting

The demon gets a CHA save at the end of each of its rounds, ending control on a success - something our available demons aren't bad at. An uncontrolled demon will remain for 1d6 rounds *(house rule: the DM rolls this in secret!)*. This added risk is a large part of why SGD has a significantly higher CR (CR5) than Conjure Woodland Beings (CR2). Not to mention summoning a demon is bound to be perceived as rather 'evil' by any of the populace that might happen to bear witness. The DM controls the demon following the caster’s brief verbal command.

· *Players* \- need to be reasonable about the commands they're issuing. At most it's a 6 second verbal instruction per round - that's at most! The player might specify out-of-character any spells or abilities they're intending the demon to use as long as it can be backed up with a reasonable command and in game knowledge. Get to work on obtaining all the books and demonology possible!

· *Players* \- and this applies for any summoning spell, be sure your DM has been forewarned to expect this spell! No DM loves running summoned creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

# Abyssal

Thanks to  u/[fortran\_69](https://www.reddit.com/user/fortran_69) for detailing in the comments why fluency in Abyssal is not required. He's linked the relevant Jeremy Crawford tweet there too. In summary: Wizards will specify if the caster needs to share a common language with the summon - so Abyssal isn't required for SGD. We can assume that while concentrating, the spell is magically turning the caster's verbal commands into comprehensible mental commands for the demon. This renders proficiency in Abyssal (or items like Demon Armor or an Ion Stone of Language) as just a nice extra - and certainly not necessary for the spell.

&amp;#x200B;

# Magic Resistance

Of these summonable demon options, more than half have the Magic Resistance feature which will give them advantage on the repeated save against compulsion. The fact that the summoning does count as a magical effect in terms Magic Resistance can be contentious for some players but the following should illustrate why that's the case quite clearly:

&gt;*The demon has been ripped from the Abyss with a complicated spell. They wouldn't even be standing in front of the caster if not for magic, let alone obeying them.*

The Demons with Magic Resistance will been even harder to maintain control over for any significant period of time but that doesn’t need to be a deal breaker. The Tanarukk is all about tanking and hitting back as a reaction. The Vrock has a 1/day stunning screech. The Chasme is high damage but allies will need to cover their ears. Should these break free early they’ll still attack the nearest enemy, which, with clever positioning should also be the caster's enemy. The Dybbuk is the only one of these that has strong utility options. The caster should be prepared to ask any questions of the possession quickly while it remains co-operative.

&amp;#x200B;

# Out of Combat

At 10 saves per minute the caster’s control granted by Summon Greater Demon won’t last for long at all - regardless of advantage/disadvantage. To the point that the maximum concentration time could have been set at 5 minutes rather than 1 hour and still be considered ambitiously long. The 6 sec combat round mechanic makes this necessary but it’s a shame the spell’s non-combat possibilities aren't realisable.

· *DM -* Consider house ruling a once per minute save out of combat for some more interesting options for your player. PCs expending resources out of combat is a good thing. The caster should be able to summon a Quasit to follow a shadowy figure, without it being practically guaranteed to rebel and start attacking a matter of seconds in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Commanding a demon to give up its true name**

If the DM were to allow this – a demon will waste its first round responding to the caster with its true name, putting the caster in an advantageous position for future rounds. RAW: there's no reason this wouldn't be a valid command, however it does seem foolish that all it takes is a trivial command - rather than careful preparation and planning. Consider the following:

&gt;*Imagine the control granted by SGD like using a marionette on a string. The marionette doesn't want to be there, but it's not its own boss. The caster controls the demon’s movements but not its thoughts. It's going to be a snarling, struggling, angry bitch the entire time it's shackled.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Summoning a specific demon**

RAW the spell text doesn’t specify that a true name can be used during the summoning to draw on a specific demon - only that the caster can specify the *type* of demon summoned. Although drawing on a specific demon does seem like a reasonable inclusion if they have the true name. By allowing a specific demon to be summoned, the caster isn't wasting that first command to reveal its true name - freeing up the demons first turn for something more useful. Allowing this isn't too powerful – after all the caster is already giving up a full action and the enemies could use this against the party too!

&amp;#x200B;

# What kind of campaign will this be?

· If this is a custom campaign where the DM is willing and able to facilitate the PC seeking out additional knowledge and to work in bits of demonology - then **I'd strongly advocate that true names can be worked into the casting to summon a specific demon, and that demons won’t reveal their names on command**. This allows the caster to bring a specific demon into the fray ready to go but the player will need to invest time and energy into finding demon law through books, trinkets, or perhaps even evoking their pact master. A demon killed in the material plane might not reform in the Abyss for a year and a day - although even time behaves oddly in the Abyss.

· For a campaign where the DM might not have the time or isn't able to chop and change the material - **it might then be better to rule that the demons are random and let true names be commandable.** Although this approach isn’t my preference and the demon will likely waste its first turn answering the caster – at least this approach requires little in terms of TLC from the DM to be effective.

&amp;#x200B;

# Come together

SGD should be fun for the players &amp; DM! But its effective use at your table is going to come down to communication. If you're the DM, talk with your player about what they want from the spell and how you see it playing out. If you're the player, communicate these things to your DM and be reasonable about what it is you’re after. Limitations and conflict can create epic story telling moments. Bringing demons into the mix intentionally is bound to bring out some memorable consequences. Does the end justify the means at your table?

&amp;#x200B;

Also after u/[Effusion-](https://www.reddit.com/user/Effusion-)'s comment - acknowledging that 1A cast time is a big deal when most summoning spells are 1-10mins",1,Summon Greater Demon
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,66,282,"We can all agree magic is a wonderful thing in our fantasy concepts, but what is magic actually? Is it energy? Is it some fancy aether matter? Where does it come from? Has it always been everywhere, or does it come from some outer plane? And if it does, could it be depleted?   

I started out accepting magic for the enigmatic thing it is made out to be. The source books were no help. In there even magic is explained away by magic, which on itself is an interesting concept. In time I grew unhappy with the way “Magic” was its own excuse. Over the years I have tried to develop a theory for my own world, one that would satisfy my need for order and consistency in an until then chaotic magic-enabled universe. I have debated with other DMs, with my players, with willing friends, participated in discussions here at BTS, and studied the writing of fantasy authors to find a suitable system. One that could answer, if not all, at least a significant portion of the questions I could think of. Some came close, Sympathy and Alchemy come to mind, but ultimately they don’t appear to cover all questions that could be asked.      

Bear in mind that I am not talking about the difference between “Soft” and “Hard” magic systems, for their difference is based on perspective. After all, a spell cast from a hard magic system may be perceived as soft by someone lacking sufficient knowledge to understand the rules. Instead, I am talking about the essence magic, not how it is perceived, or even cast: *What is magic?*       

##The Limitations   

From my background I am a scientist, and one that is a sucker for detail at that. The inevitability of this confrontation with the nature of magic was written in the stars, if such a thing existed. You see, I need to understand. I need to understand in order to manipulate, as I find trial-and-error to be a punishing method. It is for this reason that I cringe when I hear about some random dinosaurs being “summoned”, even though the caster may have never seen one, if they even exist(ed) in that world. For the same reason it pains me to find spells like *Grease* inside the rulebooks. Although hilariously childish, the practicality and morphism of such a spell in existence makes little sense to me.    

Other forms of so-called magic I do seem to have no issue with conceptually, such as telekinesis. From a scientific point of view lifting a boulder is perfectly possible, it simply takes a lot of muscle, or one uses alternative tools. The energy used to lift the object in both cases is the same, as that is a matter of conservation of energy between the laws of kinetics and potential energy. Following that same logic and that same law of conservation (called Law of Equivalent Exchange in FMAs Alchemy system) any type of energy could potentially be used to get the same job done. For example chemical potential (muscles or fuel) or another source of potential energy (counterweight) could also do the trick. So, while I don’t know the method by which the caster applies these transformations of energy, I am able to understand the worldly (not magical) mechanics behind it. Even the natural progression from *Mage Hand* to full-blown *Telekinesis* does make sense from a game progression/experience point of view.    

Distilling the difference between why one form of magic makes me itch, and the other doesn’t, took me a while, but I think I managed to put a finger on it. Magic *must be* an integrated part of (the laws of) the universe. *Magic can’t be magic for magic’s sake.* For if it wouldn’t be integrated, it would need to explain both its own existence as well as how that existence could influence an established universe with laws. Magic would become something completely arbitrary, limitless, un-connected to *any* worldly concepts. In similar argument, I can’t be a reason for my own existence, it is a paradox. Instead, if we look at our universe we see that everything is rather connected, gravity is linked to cell growth and the mass of atoms are linked to the kinetics of our solar system. So would it not be logical to assume that magic, whatever it is, would rather be an integrated part of the cosmos?     

This means, that in order for magic to be truly believable, it may not blatantly break any (pre-)existing laws within the established universe. Mind you, this statement says nothing about the method or nature with which the laws are evoked, defying laws (of gravity for example) is still on the table. They simply can’t be *broken*.  

##The Possibilities  

So, what is, and isn’t, possible in these integrated systems and in such worlds? How do you determine whether laws are broken, or in fact used to an extent not earlier thought of? Well, that is where my theories fall short. It tends to work out until you encounter someone way more knowledgeable than you and communication falters.      

In recent years I myself have started questioning spell creation, specifically how someone in your (own) world would go about designing a working method invoking magic (in some way or another). How are new spells created, and why are the spells in the source books so non-diverse? The answer to the why is quite simple, because you can’t make a book with unlimited amounts of spells. So I left the beaten path, and spend the next few months experimenting trying to determine the answer to the question of *how?*, instead.    

I left my players to their own devices, and was surprised to find that, when they found out they had free reigns in spell design and flavouring, each one of them chose to be consistent with their character and spell casting ability flavour. Rather than make absurd spells they created effects that complemented their character’s understanding of the world, magic, and its laws, without me telling them to. Near the start I only got mechanical questions “Can I exchange fire damage with lightning damage?”, but quite soon after questions started to become more philosophical. They started to question the fundamental way in which their magic presented itself, clerics without deities, paladins without a cause, divine sorceresses, and wizards that never studied.    

Of all the things I was confronted with there were none to which I could fundamentally said “No, that couldn’t exist”. They also understood, and were actually thrilled by the fact that their design choices had consequences. If your *Charm* is pheromone-based, creatures that can’t smell will be immune to it, but it might very well work on some animals instead that would normally not have the brain capacity to understand. It turns out that shifting these pathways through which magic could manifest itself did not only keep the lore and laws intact, it also did not break the game (mechanically).     

This phenomenon taught me that magic must in fact be something that is fundamental to the cosmos, something so integrated into the concept of a universe that it never directly confronts another law. Magic must be something dynamic that can be found in many places, in fact, it must be anywhere. That excludes the possibility of magic being equal to, or part of, concepts like energy, time, or matter. If it was involved with one of those concepts on that level the conversion from one form to another would take tremendous amounts of effort given the laws of conservation. However, at the table or in our favourite fantasy medium, we see that magic can mold all of the concepts above. Energy manipulation, as well as manipulation of matter and time seem to be solid concepts, so where does that leave magic?    

The only option left seems to be that magic must be something governing these concepts. Some overarching principle that dictates behaviour. Could it be that magic is, or is the result of, a universal law? The concept of magic being the (direct) result of a universal law rather than some physical manifestation, is an intriguing one. What would a law need to dictate for “magic” to become possible?   

##The Implications   

Leaving the origin and nature of the integrated magic aside for the moment the simple premise of such an integrated magic (law) already has significant implications of its own.    
  
For example, efficiency losses due to transfer from one form of energy to another might explain several motifs we see returned in for example magic items. Light, as a byproduct of some spell might simply be explained as an efficiency loss. Energy dispersed in primitive forms: heat, light, and vibrations (sound &amp; force). It would also stand to reason that any type of spell that uses one of these forms of energy as a primary output would be easier to cast (think *Magehand* or *Dancing Lights*, while the more complicated forms such as mind manipulation or transmutations take significantly more effort (as losses need to be minimised to prevent energy drains). This might even lead to mages using destruction magic being seen as primitive casters, while artificing and other forms of the more subtle magics would be seen as more skilled.      

Another implication interesting to explore is the perceived difference between divine and arcane magic. Following the premise that magic must abide to other rules and is connected to a higher law there might simply be no difference in arcane or divine magic, except for its origin. While an Arcanist might pull energy or matter from their direct environment (which they probably mistakenly call “The Aether” due to lack of understanding), a divine being might simply be a conduit itself that connects the energy of its followers to the caster (who might interpret it as power lend from their god). Lack of understanding could very well lead to this arbitrary difference between the arcane and the divine, the same way lack of understanding has created conflict in our world’s past and present.    

The existence of the divine itself is an interesting subject to explore as well. The creation of gods may in truth be little more than the combined energy and intent of thousands of people being transformed into a “divine” manifestation by magic. Sufficient similarities and intensity of belief among a group of (sentient) beings might be enough for a “spirit” or “deity” to accumulate into existence. While it might be a true manifestation it could in fact also based on an existing creature that emulates the desired intentions, in which case the matter of the being is used as a catalyst to form a new deity. Such might be the case when a hero ascends.   

Other interesting implications might still be discovered, hopefully something that comes up during the discussion about this subject.   

##The Theory      

Entertaining the possibility of magic being the result of a (universal) law opens a lot interesting paths of thought as to the how or why. The most profound one being what this supposed law would state.    

One of those paths I found to be an interesting one lead me down to the creation of the universe and its inevitable end. Some of you will be familiar with the second law of thermodynamics, that states that entropy (chaos) in a closed or infinite system must always increase. Exploring that law to its extremes produced an interesting theory in which the moment before the big bang could be seen as one of pure Order, and, with the passage of time, in which that same universe would find a disruptive end in pure Chaos (late stages of the second law of thermodynamics). A relative young universe (maybe like ours) would know order more than anything, sentient creatures would lack free will for example, while older universes on their descension into Chaos will accelerate this process by enabling more chaos to be created at will. This ratio between Order and Chaos being Agency, a measure of how much something (or someone) can influence its environment and universe. It might very well be this Agency that allows shortcuts to be taken at the momentary cost of some of that agency, shortcuts that we call Magic. Magic being a conduit for transfer of energy from a less entropic state to a more entropic state, a form of accelerated chaos if you imagine. This would mean that over time a universe develops “magic”. Universes on the younger end of their lives would be no-magic or low-magic, and those near the end of their lives more high-magic on the scale.    

The trail of thoughts does not end there, but for the sake of this article I will leave you to follow it on your own. After all it is but one of the many paths that lead from this premise, and I’m more interested to see which ones you guys come up with. I guess the answer to the question of the true origin of magic, as integrated into the world, escapes me yet. Alas, mystery is a large part of the fun.   

##The Colophon   

If you have reached to this point I am truly impressed with your efforts. The aim of this article was to inspire thought as well as discussion about the subject of Magic and what it is. I bet there are many questions at this point, as well as good arguments on how I am wrong, or even some continuation on some trail of thought I left open somewhere. I’d love to debate about this highly philosophical topic in a constructive and genuine manner.

###Design Theory

This content package is inspired by what I call a ""boxed baked goods"" approach. As a DM, I like to make my own material, but found I often lacked sufficient time or my free time varied. Thus I have developed these materials so that if the DM wants to just ""add water and bake"", the material is ready to run with little preparation. But if the DM also wants to ""add their own eggs and milk"" and write their own flavor or mechanics, it is designed to make that easy to do.

This material is made with DM input and worldbuilding as a priority. Each event and side-quest contains a preparation section with essential and optional preparation. Essential preparation is simply deciding on the creatures to use in the relevant combat encounters, sometimes treasure. Optional preparation varies from what blessing the party receives from a shrine to the mechanics of how the party foils the villain's ultimate scheme. 

The document provides suggestions for all optional preparation. If you want something you can pick up and use by just choosing creatures from those provided, it is ready. But if you want to add in your own worldbuilding and better adapt the components for your own setting, the optional preparation provides explicit places throughout the adventure and side-quests where the DM can do so.

#The Setup   

Consistency is key to the design of a believable fantasy world. While magic can be a tempting excuse for all the plot holes and irregularities in your games it has a tendency to get old really fast when it happens too often. So, in order to prevent yourself from having to say “Magic did it”, you should be prepared. Most of this can be easily avoided by starting your homebrewing top-down. This design approach will be an incredibly powerful tool to keep consistency across the board and therefore reinforce in-game immersion. This approach to world building is based on a simple premise: The features of the continent are based on the features of the world it is in. The country on that continent has features based on the features of both the continent and the world. The region in that country... well, you get the drift. This method ensures you never break the rules of my world when you start designing this town somewhere in the middle of “nowhere”.      

The design aspects of a region that will be addressed:   

-	Overarching Climate
-	Terrain &amp; Region Boundaries
-	Weather &amp; Seasons
-	Landmarks
-	Natural Resources  
   
&amp;nbsp;   

-	Population &amp; Civilisation
-	Politics &amp; Overarching Hierarchies
-	Religion &amp; Culture
-	Crafts &amp; Trades
-	Regional Specialties
-	Significant Sites
-	Significant Inhabitants   
   

You will notice I have divided the list in two parts. The first part is general and wise to do in that order regardless of the region. The second is more malleable, though if this is your first time I might suggest you to keep the order for now. Rearranging can be beneficial for example for regions you know are less civilised, in which case you might want to start with Significant Sites instead, and leave politics out of it.  

*This article/guide is meant to be used as a reference. Please don’t go overboard and work through the whole list for each and every region in your entire world! It tends to be enough the define climate zones for your world, going to natural resources for the regions of the country your players are in (and then not even all of the regions). When they travel through a region I tend to stop at Politics or Culture, only for the regions I know they are going to be in for some significant time I will go down to the end of the list.*

#Overarching Climate  

You probably already have something in mind, a country or continent, when you decide to start to fill in these regional details. Maybe you need a special region in the desert or maybe a small duchy in a western style civilization. Climate is a strong anchor point to start from as it both defines certain broad boundaries as well as forms creative condensation points to launch from. From the deep serenity of the ancient forests to the magic-nuked postapocalyptic wasteland, it doesn’t matter, all environments are valid initiation points. Just remember that any region in close proximity to the one you are about the design will need to be at least partially within the same climate zone, for consistency’s sake.    

*For the example I will be taking you along during this article I will pick a standard land-sea climate. It might seem a bit dull but I would like to illustrate that even the most simple of first steps can take you to an attractive and engaging end result.*   
  
#Terrain &amp; Region Boundaries  

Like the climate often defines the seasons, weather, and terrain throughout multiple countries, it is often only the terrain (changes) that define the (natural) boundaries of a region from the inhabitants point of view. In our own world, at least before the industrialisation, many regions were simply defined by areas with the same type of terrain. Examples of that are a small series of mountains, a large forest, wide open plains between two rivers. All these examples have a finite end. The forest ends when there are no trees left and the plains end when it hits the river. These are called natural boundaries and often form the border of a region as the inhabitants see it. Some of these borders are blurry (the forest) and some are very well defined (the river). Note however that not all regional borders originate from natural change in the terrain, some are political or territorial for example. Do not be afraid to use these as they make for great story plots. In the end, whether vague or solid, natural or artificial, large or small, these boundaries will define the playground of further thoughts. 
  
*I already chose a land-sea climate so several of the straight forward options are: coastline, forest, plains, marshes, or wetlands. For this example’s sake I will take the last one, no true marshes but soggy and wet. The wetness leads me directly to a terrain style border, a river (let’s say, to the west). At some point this wetness has to stop, where the wetlands go over in plains (to the east for example), which makes it quite a soft border. Having chosen a land-sea climate the northern border will be the dryer parts of a coastline close to the sea. The coastline itself is out of the picture because I feel that would be a new region on its own. To make things a little more interesting I will say the southern border will be political of nature (I will work this out later).*  
  
#Weather &amp; Seasons   

The seasonal changes (and general weather) can be a great influence on the creatures and nature of the region. Rain can be a plague in the marshes, but a blessing in the desert. Seasonal weather can be so extreme as tornado season or monsoons to as mild as cloudless skies or slight winter snow. Having one of these extreme seasonal changes can make a great addition but be aware of its place in the bigger picture (regions next to the current one for example). The general weather, or everyday weather, is mostly tied into the climate that is present in the region. It might sound stale but this weather is what mostly defines the daily lives of the inhabitants of your region (how much and when they work, how they behave, their culture, etc.). While weather nearly never impacts gameplay itself it is a valuable thought experiment for you as the designer, it is something you do for your own understanding.     

*Building on the terrain and climate chosen last time I will continue, starting with the day-by-day weather. Following the theme of wetness I would say it is generally cloudy and rainy, more drizzling than buckets. Mornings are foggy and cold in the wetlands and when the sun shines, it is quite weak. This creates a sort of dark gloomy feel to the environment. To strengthen this feeling I will add some seasonal weather in the form of rain days-on-end in autumn, confining the inhabitants to the inside of their homes. Very mild seasons seem to fit here, cold winters without snow and summers that you barely would call warm. Let´s go on.*    

#Landmarks    

You have set the stage with your general terrain archetype in this region, now it is time to build on top of that. Expand the features of your region with interesting formations within the terrain. These features, or landmarks as they are called, tend to be used by the inhabitants to navigate themselves or others. Often each of the borders already presents a form of such terrain (think of the river in our example) and as such you could expand upon that. In addition, throwing in some smaller features left and right does help you a lot with creativity later on.      

Examples of landmarks are a lone mountain between hills, a lake in the tundra, or a small forest amidst the plains. These can have a special reason of being there or have a special meaning to the inhabitants of the region. They might also be there for none other reason than a natural one, like the lake in the tundra formed by a natural inclination in the landscape. It doesn’t hurt to have a few spares at this point, because scrapping them is easier than retconning them in (we all know how painful that is). You don’t even need to know why, how, where, or what the features you add are for. Actually, leaving some room for yourself, and not setting everything in stone at this stage, will help you integrate the whole concept later on (saving you several possible iterations).   

*Quickly: I will insert an elongated blob of swamp between the river and the rest of the region, seems fitting to have it there. In the wild lands more to the south there will be a thin hill ridge, very jagged and overgrown with a dense forest, just for some intrigue, don't know what for yet. Three or two small lakes (not even a kilometre or 0.6 miles across) thrown in there somewhere too, we will see.* 
   
#Natural resources    

With a climate, conceptual terrain, and weather patterns come natural resources available within the confines of the region. Every region has resources, some less than others, some more. From physical resources such as rare metals, wood, or indigenous plant species to the more abstract resources such as fertile soils for crops or sources of fresh water.    

A region is not defined by its resources, rather it is moulded by them. Lack of certain essentials, or an excess of a specific commodity resource will influence behaviour of denizens. In civilised regions these resources, or lack thereof, will largely define the trade as well as some geo-political aspects. Again, throwing yourself some potential curve-balls here, or leaving inspiration a bit more open to interpretation, might benefit you in the long run.    

*Because of the gloomy description of the environment I am going to go on a limb here and say if there are inhabitants (next topic) they will not be very prosperous and wealthy. So, I will say small game wildlife is still significant parts of the essentials, as opposed to crops grown on fields (maybe near the plains on the dryer parts of land). The environment screams turf use to me, as the primary source of fuel for both cooking and heat. They also need to survive the sombre environment. What better way then self-medication.. I propose there is an indigenous flower that, when properly dried, can be used similar to chewing tobacco. Also, toads, because it sounds weird as a resource, but say they brew something from it or whatnot, let’s work that out later. To add another curveball for later let me add quicksilver. We will see.*   

#Population &amp; Civilisation     

Are there condensed population centres of sentient creatures present in this region? Some (sentient) species are more suitable to certain terrain than others, sometimes the terrain is not suited for any such life. Most likely you have already come to know whether or not the region is how to a sprawling metropolis, or desolate like the moon ([Insert paranoid conspiracy]), but otherwise it has become high time to decide. If your answer is no to any form of civilised life you may need to skip a few chapters and head over to “Special Sites”, if you are looking to populate your region instead please read on.   

Questions you could ask yourself is how many people live there, or better yet, *would want to* live there considering the previous stated terrain and environment. Is it going to be high-society (mostly in prosperous areas) or is it barely civilised. Maybe something in between. Generally the more mild the environment, the heavier populated the region is, and also, the more dangerous the environment the more humanoids flock together in close proximity. Furthermore, already give some thought about the composition of the humanoids in your settlements.     

*Since I am doing the tutorial all gloomy I will say that the environment qualifies as ''dangerous sounding'' so there will be a few bigger walled towns (protected) and a lot of small hamlets (nothing to gain) spread out over the marshlands. My guts tell me it all is dark-age like, so we will go with that. To aid that theme the composition of these towns will be mostly human, any half-race will also be tolerated, but the rest will be met with cold shoulders (Already got ahead of myself.. patience).*        

#Politics &amp; Overarching Hierarchies      

By choosing an overarching climate we connected multiple regions with each other by environmental features. However, since we choose to introduce civilisation to the region we once again need make sure the bordering regions are considered, this time from a social/geo-political perspective. For example, our region might be part of a larger kingdom province, or reigned by independent barons or duchesses, or be the gathering ground for multiple clans during a certain season. It pays to know who or what global influences move the behaviour of the denizens in your region as a DM, especially when your players start meddling in the bigger things.   

For most games it would not make a significant difference, however for those operating on a smaller scale these political movements open up a ton of possibilities regarding roleplay or political strife and intrigue. The internet is full of explanations on how these geo-political structures have worked in the past in our world, so I will not make that a study here. Besides, many of you are creative enough to invent your own political systems and hierarchy, as I would encourage if that is your thing. Do not be afraid to mix reality with fiction, it is not unheard of that there are no political systems in place at all (No-man-lands), or that the structure is not humanoid-based such as in the case of a tyrant dragon, or even steered by (outside) forces such as the Church.     

*Going along with the dark-age theme I will pick duchies as the leading political system in this, and neighbouring, regions. I talked about having a political border to the south and this would be the time to address that. I will say that the southern states/duchies are all part of the bigger kingdom, whereas in this region they recently decided to want to be independent. They likely stopped paying taxes and tributes to the king or queen, with some minor conflicts as a result, but in the end the kingdom decided it was not worth their time and effort (gloomy waste that it is). Now this “Duchy” reigns independent and political strife between them and the loyalists is probably not uncommon.*   

**Religion &amp; Culture**  
Culture and religion are two heavily intertwined subjects, one will shape the other and vice versa, culture being the overarching social structure. In D&amp;D there are a lot of options, from cults from obscure gods ruling in the shadows to angels walking in sky high citadels. In general it is the mass of the peasants that defines the most accepted form of religion or culture, unless oppressed to behave otherwise. Peasants and lower classes alike will revere something usually that they encounter in their daily lives as an obstacle. Farmers that pray for better weather, the sick and dying praying for a miracle or an easy and painless passing, and merchants praying for a good deal or safe passage for their caravans.    

Besides the official religions in the source books it pays to investigate the relevance of beliefs not tied to a specific deity, (cultural) superstitions for example. Often these are region specific and can make a great addition to the immersion level you are going for. You can make them as weird (not random) as you can muster to surprise your players, or to throw them a curveball. Sometimes they are based on local lore and hold truths (the “when you walk in the forest alone you will get eaten” children stories) and other times they were created by wrong conclusions being drawn (storks bringing babies). Almost all religion is based on believing in something bigger and more powerful than you, whether you fear it or need its protection.        

As stated before deities are the obvious candidates, however, for intrigue and mystery, it pays to go smaller. A local dryad for example, one that people pay tribute to (even if they do not know it is a dryad), or the hag coven that is running a sizeable protection scam on the local population. But note that believes do not have to be magic based at all, you would want to feed the local Ogre if he then does not eat your kids, and this might be considered far more pressing to a local farmer than some deity in some big rich church far off in the city somewhere. Figure out what the most prominent pressure is on the denizens and you will find the driving force of their culture. 
  
*Long wall of text, take what you need from it: Returning to the dark-age feel theme I would say that the local population is very much religious. They revere any and all things that can protect them or give them enlightenment in their lives, but I would say less church-based in the end and more in the form of extreme superstitions. Fear of wandering alone in the wetlands and forest patches, kids not allowed to play far from the houses because monsters will take them (maybe this is true, but most likely they just drown in the marshes), and other such things. To make it interesting I will say that the middle class citizens (so basically only in cities) believe in justice and being righteous, however unbeknown to these people (and probably most priests) this god/goddess left them a long time ago and a pact-devil took his/her place. Making dealings with the mortals in the name of righteousness to send their souls to ''The World Beyond''. Also, let’s throw in some Arcane-magic devil-worshipping hate, to screwing a bit with our beloved fireballthrowers. Out in the marshes a hag will be ''ruling'' over two or three hamlets to the west, and the people in the south revere a blood hunting Beast. That will do.*      
      
#Crafts &amp; Trades     

Trade, export and import, tends to have a strong relationship with the state of welfare in an area or region. Although most would talk about gold in this case it is actually often goods changing hands, not currency. In the lower more secluded parts of the world barter is common practice. The more civilised the more currency is used, so make a judgment about the level of civilisation. Take hereby into account the environment you have created (hostility, accessibility, welfare of neighbours, and current political situation).     

For some structure start with the natural resources you have designed earlier. Of course they could sell the raw products straight from the source, however chances are that they would add value wherever possible. This means a lot of (intermediary) products will be sold as well (turning raw iron ore into ingots, some ingots into tools, some into armour, etc.). Start from what the craft, what they are capable of, and end with what portion of that they would trade off, and which products they would need to import to make that possible.   

It is, as almost always, the details of your world that make it interesting and immersive.  Mundane items could make a brilliant story element, so ask yourself a lot of obvious questions: Who makes all the paper for the mages and scholars, and what is it made from here in the first place? Why does all the pottery have the same general markings on it? These are small hooks that all lead back to the craftsmen and women that made it in the first place. Trading can therefore give you a lot of plot hooks and missions for your players, from protecting trade caravans to establishing new-found resources for a specific merchant. Having at least one or two specialties in your region will ensure that your region gets a more realistic depth and will show the dependence of a region on its crafts and trades, making your whole world seem more whole.   

Why are there large expeditions of men every other week going into the marshes with canoes bringing back only reeds? Will the players be intrigued by these expeditions, probably, is there something behind it except for gathering the materials to make paper or fabrics, probably not. When they figure it out they may feel stupid but still feel they solved a mystery which makes it a great story, the people and the region have gained flavour, they will remember.   

*The region has semi-access to a major trade route via the river on the west side. Most trade will be done within the region regardless, between the hamlets for example. I think it would be cool to have the small lakes connected in a small network of waterways, barges would be floating from town to town visiting small villages on the way. Let’s say using the chewing tobacco flower within the city is forbidden, however healers and alchemists from the kingdom need it to purify and create potions from it so there is a tolerated ''secret'' trade. Quicksilver or mercury being a product used by mages and alchemist is not tolerated in any way (and therefore not further processed), mining is dangerous and done in secret but rewards well for those who can smuggle it over the swamp towards the merchant ships on the river. Taking my own example from above this region will be the main supply of raw material for paper. Barges to the brim filled with reeds arrive in the city every day where three dozen worker class women and children (small scale economics) pull out the fibres and put them in baskets to be sold off to the next merchant ship bound for the kingdoms capital (under all the fibre there may or may not be one or two baskets full of quicksilver ore). They keep a part of the fibre for their own uses, players may notice very well crafted baskets and fabrics woven of the stuff. Cool idea; let them watch as towns militia don themselves in lightweight armour made of the reed fibres, maybe they even want it themselves (treat it like quilted cloth).*    

#Regional Specialties      

Now we sprinkle on some tasty sprinkles, such as special beverages or dishes, region specific festivals, and local habits. In my opinion this is one of the most important, if not the most important, steps when it comes to creating flavour and unique immersion experiences for your players.    

Specific habits for a region can be an interesting way to give flair to inhabitants and NPCs, these can go from saying a short prayer before talking to strangers to full blown superstitions like opening and closing your door twice so witches and demons don't know you are home. A more common way of introducing some weird habits and quirks are festivals and events where players get a chance to get fully soaked in local culture. I honestly can’t advocate enough for those type of sessions, especially when your players are up for a session with less plot pressure. Mostly introduced by events like catching a greased pig or the ritualistic burning of a painted goat, these interactions with your world enrich it in multiple ways. Such events and festivals allow the DM to introduce some hints to demonic cults and build some connections with NPCs that get brutally murdered later on (examples of plothooks), while simultaneously giving players insight into the local spirit (non-obvious lore dump).    

Introduce some weird foods in the region for quick and dirty flavouring. Food is a good and simply way to introduce changes in culture and regions as everyone is affected by it, so it speaks to us when it is described differently. For example, cream filled insects, thick stew which turns out to be made of cute rabbits, twice fermented inside-out birds, or just a new alcoholic beverage. If you tie them in some manner to your region and give them something special (mechanically) your players will remember it. Players remembering something it is worthy of an achievement and is the ultimate measurement of flavouring success.    
   
Search for things that put some form of pressure on the existence of the civilisation or the average individual, that is where these habits, specialties, and habits come from.   

*I don’t want to go overboard in this article, so what I want to do is come up with three or four weird food related specialties of the region.*     

  - *I mentioned the tobacco flower, let’s call it the Lanac flower, white-pinkish small starlike wetland flowers. Sun dried and chewed give relaxing effect, they also use it for tea. It can be used to make healing potions when properly purified.*   

- *The toad-brew, finally, a secret recipe which the elders of the villages do not share. They brew the stuff for weeks and in the end they get a high alcoholic beverage called Brog. Those not of the area make saving throws when drinking (even dwarves).*   

- *I have read a resource somewhere where they filled the bloodsacks of stirges and fried them, I think that would fit perfectly in the swamp neighborhood.*   

  
*These may be weird to new people of the area but they are normal to those whom are born and raised there. Origin of these details can come from things that are in abundance within the region (stirges) or from social-environmental issues (like the Lanac flower).*    
 
#Special Sites     

Special sites, I get that it may be a bit generic, but they are the ones that probably bring the most dynamic to a region. This can be at any scale from vignettes, like a couple of old graves, to a full-blown dungeon adventure in the cavern of wonders or abandoned cathedrals. Ruins would fit right in this category, as do shrines for forgotten gods, and the cave of a prominent monster. It would do injustice to bind this category by more guidelines because it would start excluding some awesome and creative ideas you could fit in here.     

*Let’s start with the already mentioned weird hill ridge to the south. There is going to be something special about it, maybe that is where the dryad lives but the coolest idea I had was that this ridge is in fact a long long dead ancient (green) dragon. The ridge is its ribcage holding up the forest and scrubs that have overgrown it, cool thing, the insides of the dragon are long gone, making the ridge hollow (not many know this). Close to a nearby village there will be a special shrine, old withered stones and the place is littered with carcasses of animals, they offer living goats and chickens here to The Beast (whatever it turns out to be). There will also be an inaccessible island in the swamp that everyone avoids, home to some critters, stirge nesting place maybe.*   

#Special Inhabitants   

What is a place without memorable NPCs and creatures. Creatures are purposefully included here. Creatures can be as intriguing as any NPC if you do them right, part of this ''doing right'' is building local lore around them, letting (local) people fear it is a great way to ensure that players will bite. Establishing creatures in local lore ensures they feel part of the world, meaning that when defeated the world around them changes outside of the loot, and that change may be for the better, or for the worse. A crooked merchant and his lovely daughter are only fun twice, but the interaction of monsters and creatures with their environment (and therefore with the local people) can tell a great deal about your region.    

That said, of course NPCs should not be neglected, especially leader figures and the odd ones out in a society. Depending on your region there might be a hundred noteworthy NPCs or creatures but make ten or so special to pop out at a whim. There are tons of good guides out there on how to design NPCs, so I will leave you to that research. 
  
*This time I will make a list just because it makes it shorter and easier to read.*  
  
- *The four reigning families: Brochoff, du Moriant, Halmburg, and Prautting.*
- *An insane (lifelong Lanac flowers) old man (hermit), but we know him better as The Beast as he is an insanely big Werewolf (cursed maybe?).*   
- *The two hags that rule the hamlets in the north as nobody else cares, of course you say ''Mimir-ion, a coven is at least three'' well, you are in luck because the third one is posing as the courts sorceress and advisor in the biggest city.*
- *A lonely ogre lives in the swamp as well, the soldiers can't kill him as he just wades away into the marshes after a raid leaving the soldiers at the edge of the marsh searching for a way to pass.*
- *A small goblin clan resides next to the ridge, they however are neutral and trade mushrooms with the surrounding villages, would be a shame if somebody would murderkill them all before they knew.*
- *Oh and let’s not forget the three hibernating green dragon wyrmlings or eggs buried deep under the wetlands, better yet, one is awake and is the swamp monster. Some kind of epic swamp monster was of course a given.*   
   
***    
***   

When you design a region in this way it is not strange to back-track once in a while. Move from specific terrain back to weather and seasons to amend some cool ideas you had down the line, or add to natural resources once you arrived to craft and trades. 
These iterations are not mistakes or errors, they are in fact strengthening your concept from within. When you find yourself not having to amend anything it might be good to spice things up some more, because it could be a sign of bland design.     

**TL;DR**  Regions, flavour, and stuff...   
  


  

",1,How to Design a Region and Give it Flair - Revised Edition
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,46,"Howdy BTS!  It's been a long while.  I've got a new country, new home, new job, and finally wanted to contribute to this sub again. 

I ran this roughly a year ago (in my fantasy planar stargate campaign) and was toying with latex and an adventurer's league formatting.  I have since fixed it up for your inspiration.  

[Adventure link](https://imgur.com/a/sGIp7Zk).

Basic premise is that there's a big competition with a storied history for giants where all (giants) can compete to see who's the best 'giant'.  It's a single elimination bracket with each round themed after a type of giant. The party gets roped into competing in order to help solve a mystery.  Parties with lots of skills, magic, and ingenuity will shine.  There's space to add more combat if that's your speed as well.

I think the pngs should be viewable for all without issue, but if I need to copy a markup version to the post body, I can do that also.

Sincerely,
Your dearest cornman

Now while BTS is not really meant for sharing artwork and maps (We have r/dnd or r/dndmaps for that), we’ll make an exception here, since the map is such an integral part of any adventure. It makes it much easier to understand and run the story.

- Draw a general map of your setting. (Forest, mountain area, town, fort, lake, whatever it might be.)
- Draw a specific map for your antagonist's lair and the final encounter.
- You can use any equipment you feel comfortable with. Pen and paper, GIMP, Photoshop, InkScape etc…

Now those of us who aren’t artists might find this part a bit intimidating. Don’t get scared off if you are not very proficient in this skill. Even if you just make a good old pen and paper map, your adventure will be miles ahead of one without a map.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,26,216,"Hey! I've been sitting on this crafting ruleset I made for quite some time as I tested it in my game. It was well received by my group, so I wanted to turn it loose in the wild.

I made this ruleset because I wasn't satisfied with the crafting rules I found online and was extremely dissatisfied with the DMG and Xanathar's ruleset.

This ruleset is meant for DMs who wish to allow their players to craft items when they request it, can be used as guidelines when players hire an NPC to build an item, and especially for DMs whom don't wish to consume too much in-game time with crafting while maintaining that crafting requires both investment and skill.

While the main purpose of this ruleset is to speed up the crafting process, I have still made an attempt to ensure powerful items are not *too* easily obtained. It creates a slightly crunchier and better defined process that is quick and easy to use.

Features Include:

* Magic tools and workshops giving bonuses to craft times
* Workshop maintenance and labor costs which help you gain advantage on crafting checks if you maintain them
* Level requirements for rarities
* Shorter crafting times
* Rules for item quality and sale value
* Rules for enchanting gear to better bridge the divide between PC spellcasting and the effects items can have

I just had a pint last night with my old DM and one of my players (my fiance) and I told my DM this ""I'm not out to kill you"" philosophy I've adopted. He looked at me and smiled. ""As a DM I am trying to kill at least one of my players off"" he tells me. ""If I don't try, then there isn't as great a sense of urgency or danger and that could take away some of the fun.""

Every campaign I run, even if its sprung up on me, I create an entire world from scratch.  I honestly find the whole process of world building extremely therapeutic.  The general layout of the worlds are never similar, same goes for the politics and main story.  However, characters, encounters, voices, items, and fight mechanics I have a really hard time not recycling.  I feel if I were a player I would quickly grow tired of the items listed that I recycle, and I wouldn't mind running multiple campaigns within the same world.  


So really what I'm getting at is, what do you recycle between your campaigns? Do you ever limit how much content is recycled to keep it fresh for your players?  Do you feel worse/better about recycled content than your players do?",1,World Building/Recycling
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,231,866,"**{Why change the skills system? - not required reading}**

The issue I have with the 5e skills system is that it never makes you feel, well, 'skillful' at something. You may have been a carpenter all your life and have a +10 to woodworking but if you roll a 7 and somebody who's never touched a chisel before rolls a nat 20, they are, somehow, going to craft a better sculpture than you are. Don't get me wrong, I like that random element which means you can suddenly excel wondorously or fail spectacularly, but I think that *success or failure should be relative to your ability*, and that a good skills system should reflect that. A natural 1 for somebody that is an expert in something should not be mechanically equivalent to a natural 1 for somebody who's never done it before.

&amp;#x200B;

**{The System - Ability Bands}**

[Google Doc with all the info you'll need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImuOErZRmyWlsRBhXBPsDWIXKis0iy7VQz63Ro2Gnjs/edit?usp=sharing)

First of all, you still apply all the same modifiers you do normally to your skill rolls in this system, **except for your proficiency bonus**. All other modifiers apply exactly the same.

The central premise is that now your skills are seperated into 4 ability bands, these are: **Inept**, **Novice**, **Skilled**, and **Expert**. For example a rogue will likely be an **Expert** at *stealth* but probably be **Inept** at *performance* (your character may vary). The better ability band your skill is in, the better result you are able to achieve at the top end, but also at the lower end your failures will not be as bad as somebody less skilled than you.

&amp;#x200B;

**{The best way to demonstrate this system is to give an example}**

Your ranger is **Skilled** in *Medicine* and also has a +3 from their wisdom modifier. On your charcater sheet you have written 'Skilled+3' (or 'S+3' to keep it short) next to *Medicine*. You roll a 10 for you medicine check, then add your +3 to get 13. Then you look at the **Skilled** section of the table below and see that 13 means you got the result 'good'. **This is your result**.

&amp;#x200B;

**{The Table}**

||Inept|Novice|Skilled|Expert|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|20|Good|Great|Superb|Brilliant|
|16-19|Ok|Good|Great|Superb|
|11-15|Poor|Ok|Good|Great|
|6-10|Bad|Poor|Ok|Good|
|2-5|Awful|Bad|Poor|Ok|
|1|Catastrophic|Awful|Bad|Poor|

&amp;#x200B;

**{DCs are words now, not numbers}**

So instead of the DM deciding you need to get a 15 *perception* to spot the hidden trap, now the DM would decide you need to get a 'great' result. You can see from the table above that this means somebody who is **Inept** at *perception* would never see the trap, but somebody who is an **Expert** would only need to achieve an 11 or above to spot it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**{How do you move up ability bands?}**

Initially at character creation your base charcater is **Inept** in all skills. However,  at 1st level you gain 8 ‘skill points’ to spend, and every time you level up you gain 1 skill point. 

By spending 1 point you can move a skill from **Inept** to **Novice** or from **Novice** to **Skilled**, however it costs 2 points to move a skill from **Skilled** to **Expert**. This means to fully level up a skill, you would need to spend 4 skill points. 

You do not need to spend skill points as soon as you acquire them, and indeed will need to save one for a level if you want to get the two required to become and **Expert** in something.

&amp;#x200B;

*(The google doc above has more information in it, hopefully all you need to use the system as I do with my players.)* 

&amp;#x200B;

**{Conclusion}**

There are two main benefits me and my players have found with using this system. The first is that it makes the PCs feel more distinct. The cleric now *really is* the best at medicine, they can achieve results nobody else can, the barbarian *really is* the best at athletics; the party has become more aware of who is good at what and rely more on eachother.

The second is that it somehow just feels better to say you did 'good' or 'superb' or 'awful' at something. It's considerably more thematic and players immediately understand how well they've done. It's easier for us to imagine somebody being 'great' or 'bad' at something, rather than it is to imagine being '16' at something.

The main downside I see is that it does take a little longer for players to figure out their results, but not much longer. I print a copy of the table onto the back of each of their character sheets so they simply get their number then flip over and read out their result.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,105,"  

This trap is best suited for the lair of a magic user or someone with access to illusion spells. The trap guards a hallway to an important location of your choice. The hallway is otherwise unremarkable except for a small niche, 5 ft by 5 ft, cut into one the side walls. Although the floor of the niche seems solid, it is an illusion which conceals a steep-sided pit. You can make the bottom of the pit trap as nasty as you like (spikes? zombies anyone?). When any person approaches the niche they hear the grinding of machinery and a spiked panel, as tall and as wide as the passage, appears to glide out of a hidden slit ahead of them. It begins advancing slowly down the hall in the direction of the party. Seconds after, a similar panel covered in spikes appears behind them and begins to slide towards the players as well. Both the spiked walls are purely illusionary and cause no harm to anyone that contacts them. The intention of the trap's designer is to trick intruders into taking shelter in the niche to avoid the spiked walls, causing them to fall through the false floor. 

I wouldn't call for a check to see through the illusion until any of the PCs attempt an action which would cause them to doubt their senses (such as touching one of the spiked walls). Instead, give clues that something is not quite right. I note, for instance, that the loose dust and plaster seemingly being shaken loose by the passage of the spiked walls is not coming to rest on the floor of the passage. Rather, it passes right through and out of sight (it too is an illusion). You might also mention that there is no obvious place from which the spiked walls could have emerged from.

Have fun!",1,Illusionary trap idea
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,20,250,"I’ve been following a train of thought. We all take inspiration from real life, from our experiences. And in order for us to be writing *fantasy* instead of just fiction, we personify that into something grander and more representative.

And when it comes to DnD, there are 3 things which I feel don’t do this properly. Diseases, Potions, and Poisons. In my many years of learning 3.5 in high school, I never once used a disease from the source books. They were boring. They were just real diseases. They didn’t do anything new or *mean* anything.

I started to follow this train of thought as I try to expand what I do in games. I’ll be honest, I mostly do NPCs. That’s what I use 99% of the time. I like to talk. I’m getting better at including combat, but I still don’t use traps, poisons, diseases, or any of the other obstacles that are present in the real world, and very often in a fantastical world.

Today we’re going to talk about diseases. 6 of them. The BIG SIX of my world, and maybe you’ll find one to use in your world. These are all my way of looking at real diseases and trying to translate them. The horror. The isolation. The pain. I like to write about things that personally scare me. That’s the root of horror. So yeah...let’s dig in.

Cuernosis
--
Also known as the Demon’s Disease. It’s a fairly common disease that has sprouted up recently, which causes the cells to multiply and harden in strange patterns. The outward effects of this are the horns which grow, usually from the head, but not always. They always grow in pairs, and can reach a length of 12 inches. To cure the disease, the horn must be sold to a demon, who will then find a new host for the disease. No one is sure how it started.

If the disease is left unchecked, horns grow on the inside of the body until something is punctured and the patient dies.

Auto-Engrosia
---
This disease only affects humans, and can show signs starting as young as adolescence. It begins small, around one finger tip. It would take luck to see the signs at this point, but the finger tip is no longer under your control. And when the disease is left unchecked, it expands down the fingers and outwards to the others until the entire hand is no longer under your control. 

Amputation is the first step. But that rarely works, as the disease is not in the limb itself. It’s in the brain. And without intervention from a mage, the disease will spread up one side of your body until it reaches the brain itself, where it will then have full control of your motor functions, leaving your conscious mind trapped in shell that is no longer its own.

Those fully taken by Auto-Engrosia will not be discernible from the general public. Your neighbor could be living with it. Your friends. Family. The only way to know is to present the inflicted with something draconic. The closer to a real dragon the better. Because those taken by Auto-Engrosia will stop at nothing to be eaten by a dragon. There is no known cure, only safety nets that a wizard can put in place, such as simulacrum, resurrection, and permanent paralysis.

The Elven Curse
--
Named such because all elves are cursed with it. It is why they must stay in the woods. It keeps the curse at bay. Half-Elves can be carrier but cannot be affected by it. Humans and other races are in danger of getting it if cursed by an Elf (or Half-Elf). 

To put it simply, this disease affects all internal organs, animated them and turning them into animals. Intestines turn into a giant centipede, liver turns into a large toad, heart flutters into a bird, bladder into a mess of butterflies, brain into a giant crab. You will be alive and feel everything as this happens, even as they try to escape your body. You will stay alive until those animals are killed, as they are your organs. 

There is no cure. But you can live with this disease by capturing the animals and taking care of them. 

Aquarium Disease
--
This disease changes the lungs. They can no longer breathe oxygen and must breathe water, like a fish. If you are not submerged in water you will suffocate. But it doesn’t stop there. You will just wake up one day like this, and as the disease progresses you will need to breathe deeper, and deeper water. A pond will suffice, until you’ll need a lake, and then the sea. Until you’re sunken to the seafloor and are left to die.

There is no known cure, but on the seafloor you may find something...

Carnal Dementia 
--
This disease affects the elderly. It replaces their memories with either fake memories, or just memories that are not true of their life experience. It starts as a slow growth, little dips into another personality, until eventually the patient is no longer who they were before. They have a new name, a new personality, a new life. They want to get out of the hospital and find this new life, but no one has been able to follow a patient to their destination, and most families are reticent to allow their grandpa/grandma to go wandering the world like an adventurer.

Mage Liver
--
This happens from the constant exposure of potions to your liver. The organ itself begins to grow technicolor, as the remnants of all the potions are soaked up. You see, when a mage makes a potions (or anything) it's impossible for a little bit of themself to *not* get put into it. So as the liver absorbs these potions, they are also absorbing little parts of mages, alive or dead. You have nothing to fear from the living ones. But the dead ones...they will infect you through the liver, granting you spell slots of their old spells. This in and of itself doesn’t sound that bad. But if you cast them, or begin to learn more, all of that energy is going to the dead mage. Every spell learned is imprinting their brain onto yours. Every spell cast is teaching *your* body *their* movements. This is the resurrection long-game. This is immortality.

Its great for rolling multiple tables at once, but it also presents some fantastic soft metrics to qualify the roll. This system uses the most basic application of these soft metrics, the location of the dice on the table, to build a town map.

**Commoner Mob Encounter**

As most of us know, our players tend to do the most unexpected things possible in our games. When faced with a new and *confusing* situation, they always tend to surprise us. My players recently entered a small city with the goal of entering the walled of manor of the local lord. After unsuccessfully trying to walk through the gate, they found the best option was to start a local revolt. I rolled with this and decided to try something new. I designed my own mob mechanics for what I believed became in interesting encounter. Hope you guys can also make use of it.

**Setting the Scene**

My players found themselves down a street 40 feet wide leading to the manor’s gate, surrounded by houses and shops on both sides. The only real way to go was forward down the street, or through some alleys between the buildings. The revolt had successfully started and the players managed to gather a small group of commoners to march on towards the gate. The gate was attached to a long wall that separated the manor from the rest of the city with 5 guards stationed at the gate and groups of 1d4 guards every 15 feet. The buildings ended 30 feet before the gate opening the area up to the nearby city wall, which had a single archer ever 15 feet. These archers on the city boarder wall could only attack at the mob was immediately at the gate due to the building coverage. Players and mob win after one full round of the mob at the gate.

**Mechanics for Building the Mob**

Before the march, each player made an attempt to gather a group of people for the mob. They made a performance or persuasion check to see how many people they gathered. Check result = People gathered. The mob will start with a minimum of 10, and grows based on players checks.

Once ready to march, roll for initiative against the guards. Players have free movement in the space you define at the road and distance to the gate. Combat continues as normal. Guards can attack players or the mob. Each commoner has 2HP for the sake of taking damage. For their action, players can attack the guards or attempt to gather more commoners for the mob through a performance or persuasion check. Every successful guard kill prompts a performance or persuasion check to gather people.

After a full round of combat, the mob goes. The mob will add the people gained by the players checks and moved forwards towards the goal. Distance traveled is equal to ½ the mob’s count rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 with a minimum movement of 5 feet. The mob arranges themselves into rows the width of the road. After the mob goes, roll a d4 to see how many guards enter the battle by running from the manor wall.

As the mob moves forwards, they have a trample ability. Any incapacitated individuals directly in front of the mob will get trampled as it moved forward. Trample damage is a d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12. Dice is determined by the number or rows deep the mob is. If the mob does not move completely over the trampled target, the target gets trampled again if still incapacitated come the next mob advancement.

&amp;#x200B;

|Rows of Mob Participants|Trample Damage Die|
|:-|:-|
|1-4|1d4|
|5-6|1d6|
|7-8|1d8|
|9-10|1d10|
|11+|1d12|

&amp;#x200B;

If anything seems vague or confusing, please let me know so I can try and correct it!

Here is a cleaned up table to try and help make sense of things.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,22,160,"First of all, this is one of my first posts here hope it like you. I take this idea from the anime Phi Brain: kami no Puzzle and it fits very well in the DnD world

&amp;#x200B;

**The Chromatic Puzzle**

The puzzle consists in a pilar with six holes with the shape of a semisphere, and inside the hole a number. Around the pilar, enhanced in the rock there are six gems with different colors (Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Purple and Orange).

In order to solve the puzzle and open the gate, room, treasure, what you want. You need to put the orbs inside the holes in a specific order.

&amp;#x200B;

The holes make the shape of a triangle (below how it will look as an example)

\--------6

\----5-------6

4------6-------3

&amp;#x200B;

Why is chromatic puzzle? How to solve it?

To start, you need to know that every sphere take the color from one of the effects of the chromatic orb:

* acid = Green
* cold = Blue
* fire = Red
* lightning = Yellow
* poison = Purple
* thunder = Orange

Apart from that, the number in the holes, specify the color you need to put inside. For example RED = 3 &amp; BLUE = 4, GREEN = 5, then the 6 between both (red and blue) should be a color that fits (PURPLE).

&amp;#x200B;

And here is the fun. Because you can make many different things.

1. Every time a player put a orb in a wrong hole, use the spell chromatic orb with the type of the orb to the player.
2. If they put all of them incorrect, fire 6 chromatic orbs randomly between the players.
3. depending the level of your players you can use the chromatic orb spell as a spell slot 3rd, 4th, 5th... etc.
4. Create and innovate

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,54,723,"Hey all, I've been working on some revised rules for Long Rests that aim to create more interesting evenings for adventurers.  I borrowed this concept from the Pathfinder Kingmaker video game.  Feel free to review this set of rules and provide feedback.  DCs of course are variable based on your location and preferences.  Thanks!

TLDR Changes:

1. Long Rest now allows you to regain only up to half your max HP instead of all of it.
2. Camp Roles created, allowing skill roles to improve the conditions of the camp.
   1. **Foraging** for food
   2. **Concealing** the campsite to reduce random encounters
   3. **Cooking** meals to improve healing
   4. **Defense**, which is basically an attempt to provide structure to overnight guard duty

Things in bold are either changes to the original text or specific skill checks.

\-----

**Long Rest.**  A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting Spells, or similar Adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. **Each long rest is assumed to contain 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of downtime (1 hour before sleep and 1 hour after sleep).**

At the end of a long rest, a character regains lost Hit Points, **equal to half of their total Hit Points (rounded down)**. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice of his or her choice upon finishing a long rest. A character can never have more Hit Dice than their character level. A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

**Camp Roles.** During a long rest, characters can take on certain Camp Roles to improve the quality of the camp site and the long rest. These Camp Roles include **Foraging**, **Concealment**, **Cooking**, and **Defense**. At least one character must be assigned in the Camp Role for the camp to receive a benefit from the activity, and additional characters assigned to the same role grant advantage to the primary assignee.  One character cannot be assigned to multiple Camp Roles, but multiple characters can be assigned to one Camp Role.  Activities performed in support of Camp Roles are generally not considered Adventuring activities, and will not interrupt a long rest.

1. **Foraging.** Characters assigned to the Foraging Camp Role spend 1 hour hunting or foraging for food and water within 500 feet of the camp site. After 1 hour, the character rolls a **DC 15 Survival** or **DC 15 Nature** skill check; characters who use fishing tackle, hunting traps, or herbalism kits may receive an expertise bonus on the skill check.  The DM should feel free to modify the DCs based on the availability of resources.
   1. **Critical success:** You find fresh rations equal to 2d6 plus the assignee’s Wisdom modifier.
   2. **Success:** You find fresh rations equal to 1d6 + 1.
   3. **Failure:** You find 1 fresh ration only.
   4. **Critical Failure:** You immediately risk a random encounter located 1d6 x 100 feet from the camp site.
2. **Concealment.** Characters assigned to the Concealment Camp Role spend 1 hour building camouflage for the camp site. After 1 hour, the character rolls a **DC 10 Survival** or **DC 10 Stealth** skill check; characters who use carpenter’s tools, cartographer’s tools, or disguise kits may receive an expertise bonus on the skill check. If the camp starts a fire, the DCs are increased by 5.  If the camp cooks a meal, the DCs are increased by another 5.
   1. **Critical Success:** You completely avoid random encounters during the long rest.
   2. **Success:** You reduce the chance of random encounters during the long rest.
   3. **Failure:** You had no effect on the chance of random encounters during the long rest.
   4. **Critical Failure:** You accidentally increase the chance of random encounters during the long rest.
3. **Cooking.** Characters assigned to the Cooking Camp Role spend 1 hour cooking a nourishing meal for the party.  The camp must provide 1 ration for each character who plans to eat the meal, and the assignee must have at least 1 ration to cook a meal.  The camp must have a heat source to cook.  After 1 hour, the character rolls a **DC 10 Survival** or **DC 10 Nature** skill check; characters’ who use cooking utensils, alchemist’s supplies, or brewer’s supplies may receive an expertise bonus on the skill check. If the camp was successful in Foraging, the DCs are reduced by 5. If the camp lacks cooking utensils, the DCs are increased by 5.  If the meal lacks 1 ration per character who plans to eat the meal, the DCs are increased by another 5.  If the camp lacks a heat source to cook with, cooking is not possible.
   1. **Critical success:** Characters who eat this meal regain all of their Hit Points and Hit Dice at the end of the long rest and gain advantage on all Constitution checks until the next long rest.
   2. **Success:** Characters who eat this meal gain an extra 2 Hit Dice at the end of the long rest and gain advantage on all Constitution checks against diseases until the next long rest.
   3. **Failure:** Characters who eat this meal do not gain any special effect.
   4. **Critical Failure:** The meal has been spoiled in the making, wasting the rations used for the meal; The group must eat cold rations. In addition, the failed meal creates a stench, increasing random encounter chances during the long rest.
4. **Defense.** Characters assigned to the Defense Camp Role spend part of the night standing guard over the camp site while the rest of the group sleeps. Having watchmen on duty increases the chance of the camp responding well to potential threats. You must assign enough watchmen to cover all hours of sleep. Groups traveling without elves need to cover 6 hours of sleep, while groups traveling with elves only need to cover 4 hours of sleep. Characters who forego sleep entirely gain exhaustion as normal.
   1. **2-hour shifts.** Watchmen who take 2-hour shifts run no risk of exhaustion after the long rest.
   2. **3-hour shifts.** Watchmen who take 3-hour shifts must succeed at a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** at the end of the long rest to avoid gaining one level of exhaustion which lasts 1 hour.
   3. **4-6-hour shifts.** Watchmen who take a shift longer than 3 hours, but sleep for at least 2 hours, must succeed at a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** at the end of the long rest to avoid gaining one level of exhaustion which lasts 4 hours.",1,Assigned Camp Roles for Long Rests
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,1,58,"# Shepherd Druid

In life, nature and life find their way - time immemorial has guided the hand of the invisible and seen fit to grace the world with life and the struggle that it finds itself in. The struggle is endless, the squirming and screaming of life fighting, endless toil, against the jaws of Death. To give the world a fighting chance, the Druid was called forth, from the planet's cry, from the mists of Time, the struggle was always one-sided. Life may go on, but Death rarely loses. 

Druids shepherd the world, warriors and philosophers, and sages, and madwomen, all dedicated to the perfect mix between life and death, to even the odds - but the afterlife, and Death, is not the end, and why should the fields of bone be untended? Does the world of the dead not still need the living, or else its Balance is tipped towards entropy and eradication? Walkers of the Bone Fields. Shepherds of the Dead and Undead. Shepherd Druids, they are called.

Shepherd Druids primarily call the Outer Planes their home. Called into death themselves, and raised to serve the Balance by the whims of the gods, they reside where the bulk of the dead reside - in their chosen deity's afterlife.

Some, however, are forced to return to the Prime Material Plane and deal with the constant meddling in the mechanisms of death by mages, druids, adventurers, and schemers. Sometimes they are forced to be warriors instead of shepherds, and in these cases the Shepherd Druid dedicates themselves to understanding the magicks and forces they fight - some will have Magic Initiate as a feat, and all will understand the basic workings of Arcane Magic. 

Shepherd Druids hunt the Undead and return them to their proper places. Bounty hunters of a sort, and they have trained themselves to deal with all manner of the escaped and restless dead - corporeal or ethereal, their knowledge transcends and they have built up centuries of shared wisdom to train the new Shepherd Druids who are called forth to serve.

Shepherds Druids, on the Prime Material Plane (PMP), stalk cemeteries, crypts, dungeons, and other ""classic"" necromancer/undead locations, always on the hunt and always ready to sacrifice anyone and anything to their cause. They are zealots, and most are driven by tragedy which makes them reticent to listen to reason. 

Shepherd Druids rarely wildshape, and when they do, they most often take the form of scavengers, who are able to digest rotting flesh (to keep the wilderness free of disease). 

### Mechanics 

These are optional, of course, and meant to add some flavor to your ""fancy NPCs"".

* Altered *Tree Stride*: There is a Shepherd-version of this spell that works on crypts for the Druid. 
* Gain modified *Darkvision* - works as Warlock's *Devil Sight*
* Gain *Darkness* spell.
* Shepherd Druids understand the imbalance present in all forms of undead. They are able to know how close to *unmaking* an individual undead currently is, as a free action. 
* Shepherd Druids speak all forms of *lingua mortuorum*, languages of the dead. 
* Shepherd Druids are immune to possession and cannot be raised into undeath. 
* Shepherd Druids gain *Sanctify Corpse* as a cantrip. 


# NPC Examples

* **Meemaw Tengravel**: This druid is herbalist and mortician for a clan of her folk, Dwarves. She attends to the dead in the honored traditions of her people and her Order. She is kindly, but secretive, as all her kind are, and though she seems harmless, was once an Avenger Druid who fought on the outer planes in the endless Flesh Wars. Her knowledge is vast and deep, though she hopes to never have to use the bulk of her skills ever again. 

* **Timberlaine Lake**: This druid has the unhappy task of watching over a vast battlefield - a traditional locations for the tribes in the area to settle their disputes. It is thick with hauntings, apparitions mostly, reliving their final moments, but the occasional malevolent spirit will rise here. There are places where the ground is more bone than soil, and sometimes corporeal undead rise from these poisoned death mounds. Trenches and stone fencelines zig-zag across the open field, and the local wildlife stays well away from this place. The druid's duties are simple. Keep the ground as quiet as possible, and attend to the freshly dead during times of dispute and war. Timberlaine was once a warrior here, these were once his people. His near-death here tied him to the land and he hears its cry of distress when the restless dead walk. 

* **Undiri Muck**: This druid has chosen to serve the Order on the Outer Planes, and is an active warrior in the Flesh Wars. Dispatching undead and settling the troubled spirits of the newly deceased take up all this druid's free time. Always on the move, always with a mission, Undiri has little patience for questions or explanations, but will bark commands and bully anyone who will help achieve the druid's goals. The Shepherd Druid is young, more full of bravado than experience, but remains loyal to the Grand Balance.


# Plot Hooks

* In the midst of an undead invasion/outbreak, the party sees a Druid putting down a large group at once with magic. If approached the Druid will ask for their aid, and if ignored, they will see the Druid later leaving the scene. 
* A village caretaker Druid approaches the party and accuses them of possessing dark/necromantic magicks. The druid demands they hand the offending object over and wants to know where they obtained it. 
* A Shepherd Druid is disguised as a tinker, and is giving away amulets to passers-by. The Druid will refuse all payment and guarantees their effectiveness against all forms of ""the shambling dead"". The amulet is real and will make the characters invisible to Zombies and Ghouls for 1 hour/day (the amulet does not have a command word, but will activate automatically in the presence of the creatures).
* A Shepherd Druid is attempting to complete a ritual, and the party is in the dungeon where the Druid needs to obtain the final ingredient. The Druid will fight for it, but is open to negotiation if the party is - the Druid will explain the ritual's purpose and ask for their aid. 
* A local forest has become corrupted, and a *rogue* Shepherd Druid is the cause. The Order is sending agents to deal with the problem, but in the meantime, the locals are being terrorized. 
* A dead Shepherd Druid is half-in, half-out of an open portal one of the Outer Planes. On the druid's person are 2 powerful weapons as well as a letter imploring the druid to complete some vital task.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,28,169,"[Last month, almost exactly a month ago, I did an AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a8935r/ive_been_dming_for_13_years_and_im_going_to_turn/) I told everyone that for every username that asked me a question, I would turn that name into the room of a Megadungeon. Here's the AMA. [Here's the first post where I showed the ideas for the first 50 rooms.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a9ue9k/the_making_of_a_megadungeon_part_1/) 

I've completed the first pass of all 243 rooms. The things that are in here are making me excited. This megadungeon will be the most *ME* dungeon that has ever and will ever exist. It's mostly social. There are a lot of sad, sad NPCs to interact with and try to save. And when you're not talking to them, you're fighting monsters that are tricky and interesting and fun. Scary, I hope. This place is growing a little scary. 

[Here's a googledoc with all the first draft, initial ideas for the 243 rooms.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ssibbo8SP_-acaRErCCQDlSYXolqQV2yG92E6WPYf2Q/edit?usp=sharing) I didn't copy-paste it here because to you, it probably won't be so useful. It literally is just the pure, unedited ideas that I had when trying to get through every name. It's enough for *me* to run and use because I know what I meant lol Some of the stuff probably won't make sense.

This was step three, after completing the rooms. I went through and took all the ideas that sounded like wandering monsters or inhabitants that could be fought that weren't just stuck in one room, and created this d100 encounter chart.

You might have some questions...let me try to preemptively answer some of them while also explaining some more about the megadungeon! :D

**The Sun King's Palace**
---
This guy was the real deal. The last of the real one. Sin, the first demon, fucked up by trying to get too much power. Atom, the pirate king, fucked up by having too many daughters with too many women who could kick his ass. The Smiling Giant...well she got pinned to the moon. 

Sun King though? He wasn't gonna fuck up like them. He was gonna keep everything on the down low. So he married the sun and gave birth to the Phoenix. Everyone thought that was a cool move. Then he hoisted a palace from the Phoenix. Everyone thought that was less cool. But whatever. 

The problem with the sun though, is it gets eclipsed. And yeah. The Phoenix was eclipsed and shattered into little pieces of sun, sinking the palace to the bottom of the sea and birthing the Sphinx, a lion-creature of black and gold fur.  

**The Sea Floor**
---
As we all know, if you go deep enough in the sea, the water ceases to be, replaced by the inky black of abyss. The palace sunk here and became stained. It's just what happens to things in the abyss. The stain changes people. Breaks them down to their most basic. 

So now the palace is still down there, ruled by its king, inhabited by its stained court, waiting for someone to unite the Pieces of the Sun and raise them from this hell...before a new sun is eclipsed and the Sphinx is born again.

Murder Animals
---
These are *dire* versions of these animals. They tend to move twice as fast as any human and can weild weapons if they think it will help. Morningstars are their favorite. In some ways they're more human than the court.

Court Guards
---
Fight with plate, tower shield, and pikes. They use their reach to surround opponents and then let their shields feast.

Blue Skinned Stain
---
These are people stained pure blue, who float about in their permanent sleep, singing sleeping tunes to lull you away to the abyss.

Gobba
---
They're basically kirby. They suck up a PC and get abilities based on the class. They're cute and I can't wait to use them.

Dwarkas
---
Gremlins who eat your stain to grow larger.

Midozer
---
They jump on you and turn to stone to weigh you down.

Discord Snarl
---
Fancy way to saying ""ink-stained dogs""

Quatch Bugs
---
Fireflies that glow in the ink but they also sap years of life.

Scalipers 
---
Tiny creatures that dig into your skull and turn into horns. So if you see a horn, watch out.

Melancholic Haze 
---
This is like an animated fireball gif that is stuck as an ever-crawling explosion of blue.

Oblisk 
---
Nearly indestructible creatures. 50/50 chance of either being immune to all martial attacks or all arcane attacks.

Deffany's geese
---
Deffany is a nice girl. She had some pet geese that would wander the garden. They cast continual light and lay golden eggs. Deffany will think you're cool if you bring the geese back.

Ninodon
---
Lesser lord of the Sun King. He is looking for his throne and is kind of a giant.

Teddy Bomb
---
This ink-stained girl had a lot of stuffed animals. They explode.

""Milkshakes""
---
A giant centipede creatures with a human face and just keeps calling you ""Milkshake""

Archblade
---
Knights of the Sun King himself. Golden armor. Long, white hair as tough as steel. All women. All faster than lightning.

Skullhunter
---
Big spider with hyper intelligence that likes to hunt humans and talk to them while eating their insides.

Targaled
---
A beast with three deer heads, antlers intertwined, the body of a lizard. Can only be slain by a morningstar.

Kastor
---
Advisor of the king. He wants the pieces of the sun for himself and will trick you and lie to you.

Micah
---
Fae with an Unblade.

Xalthir
---
He's a beholder and carries the Grand Scroll, which requires 10 eyes to read.

Hat  Seller
---
Sells hats from deceased adventurers. That's it.

THE SPHINX
---
All the people who were unable to answer a riddle the Sphinx told them are trapped near the Sphinx's lair. Their faces are present in the Sphinx's mane and can ask you questions of their own to stun you. 

---------------------------------------------------

**STEP IV**
---
Continuing from here, with the encounter table and the room ideas, I plan on running a couple dungeoneers in here to see what's going on and what works. Mainly I want to do this because inspiration strikes me different at the table and I think more, better ideas will be born from the adrenaline and the ideas I already have written. 

**STEP V**
---
After running at least three sessions, or while I'm doing that, I'm going to list all NPCs. Just get the list. At this point I will have all the room ideas, an encounter table, and a table of NPCs.

**STEP VI**
---
This is a big one. I'm going to go through and *create* each NPC and stat each monster. 

**STEP VII**
---
And the semi-final step. Take all of that and re-write each and every room into a runnable format. Then at this point the dungeon will be nearly complete. 

**STEP VIII...IIX? idfk**
---
I do what I call a ""Secrets Pass"" where I add in all the treasure, collectables, hidden lore, and generally anything else that can be discovered, changed, or hidden. 

**BEYOND**
---
This is up to you. If people are still interested in this. If they don't care. Cause I can do this for myself and I can update you on the process as much as I am able to. I'm not much of a teacher. 

But I want to lay it out, draw for it, and release it as a megadungeon. A big fat book. Maybe a couple mini-zines. Idk. This project is still new and exciting for me. 

If you like this let me know. Follow me on reddit if you want. [Go check out my blog where I write more DnD stuff that I can't post here.](https://insidethegiantseye.blogspot.com/) I'll stop trying to sell you my book. Thanks to those of you that bought it. There's TWO more issues of that zine coming. Each with a new location. Until then--

Good luck, don't die",1,Encounters in the Sun King's Palace
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,318,"For parties Level 3-5

**The Space:** 

An expansive Cavern with natural stone columns where stalactites and stalagmites have joined connecting the floor to the ceiling 50 ft above.

clusters of stalagmites are scattered throughout the floorspace  preventing straight paths to anywhere, with matching stalactites overhead. These clusters obscure the space and provide places where anything could be hiding.

It is quiet in this cavern, sound seems to be swallowed up by the stones and darkness, even your voice doesn't carry as far as to expect.

The smell of minerals and Salt hangs in the air

**Effects:**

* **Silence** anything attempting to move quietly in this space has advantage on the attempt.

* **Spikes** moving through a stalagmite cluster requires the use of half of a creatures total movement to get through safely, or sucess on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check of DC 12 to move at normal speed. Failure results in (2d6) Piercing damage. Forced  movement onto the spikes deals 2d6 Piercing damage. 

* **Darkness:** No natural light

**Notes:**

* The stalagmites provide light concealment, those with the columns and larger stalagmites providing full cover, in addition there should be plenty of places to hide ambushers.

**Encounter**
----

Grimlocks and Deathdogs


**Location:** The Quiet Caverns.

**Type:** Combat (Two Phase)

**Challenge:** Multiple Grimlocks, Deathdogs

**Opening:** ahead of the party are three stone grey humanoids hunched over the body of some creatures, they rip raw flesh from the corpse lips smacking as they chew.

One of them turns in your direction it's eyeless face moving from left to right is it sniffs the air and feels around for the spiked club by it's side. The creature is aware of your presence if not your location.

**Phase one**

As combat starts the three Grimlocks will close to attack, moving towards the party at half speed until the parties location is discovered (within blindsight radius or the characters make an attack).

Additionally between three and five more Grimlocks will emerge from rocky hiding places in the darkness and attack the party from the sides.  (Average Grimlocks stealth will be 16, due to advantage in rocky terrain and/or the bonus to moving quietly in this room; in addition without light, darkvision characters roll perception with disadvantage)


**Phase one Flavor:**

*With a cry you find yourself flanked By several more grey eyeless humanoids each armed with a vicious spiked club of bone and stone, they appeared to have been well hidden among the stones.*


**Phase Two** 

At the end of the second round of combat a Deathdog will arrive having used the entirety of its movement to get close enough to engage in melee combat on its next turn.

The Death dog will target the closest humanoid, Grimlocks included.


**Phase Two Flavor.**

*You hear a low echoing rumble from the rear of the group the aggressive movement from one of your ambushers visably checks as it's face how's from a determined grimice to a concerned scow.*

*A moment later a massive two headed beast with black &amp; and gnashing jaws dripping with strings of saliva dashes out from the darkness*


----

**Notes:**

* You should have enough Grimlocks on the field that they can have a few left by phase two, and probably last until turn 3 of combat.


* Any Grimlocks near the Deathdog will attempt to reposition away from the Deathdog, trying to keep the characters between it and them.


* The Grimlocks will attempt to flee the fight as a group if half their number are defeated, and each individual Grimlock will flee if reduced to blelow 1/2 hp.


* The Grimlocks will only move through the spikes by expending half their movement speed, as they can not see the spikes to navigate the spikes at speed

- - - -

**Purpose**

The goal of this encounter is to give a fight with multiple opponents coming from all sides, while no one Grimlock is dangerous they do need to be hit hard to dispatch quickly.

AOE characters will most likely be able to eliminate the threat from the group of 3 at the front.

The Deathdog gives the DM a pressure release that they can adjust. If the party is doing poorly the Deathdog will have more Grimlocks to target, if the party is doing well it acts as a stronger threat.

The Deathdog's disease can potentially add a ticking clock to the rest of the dungeon as a long rest will result in a loss of Max HP in exchange for refilling other resources.

The spikes add terrain that players should enjoy exploiting and providing a choice of how they want to try to reposition making the spikes a mobility restriction and opportunity at the same time.

I recommend using more Grimlocks as opposed to less, as a high damage roll from most attacks a player makes should be enough to drop a Grimlock below 1/2 hp

To make this harder a pair of Deathdogs or (up to) double the number of Grimlocks

The final encounter with the antagonist is usually the most memorable part of an adventure. It needs to be unique. Create the final encounter with the antagonist. Help yourself a little by answering these questions:

---

- How does the combat with your antagonist differ from previous combat encounters?

- How does the antagonist use their own environment to their advantage?

- What unique mechanics can you include in the fight? (A time limit, a changing environment - e.g. moving walls, a slippery floor which makes it hard to run, darkness or light so bright nobody can see, a permanent silence spell or antimagic zone etc.)

- What will the characters learn from the antagonist while they fight him?

- How can the encounter be resolved? (It might not need to end in murder, a peaceful resolution could be found. Try to find at least 3 solutions – and don’t worry, your players will find 3 different ones.)

- Does the adventure end when the antagonist is defeated? (An interesting challenge might be escaping the antagonists lair after they have been defeated.)

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,37,412,"One of the cardinal rules of Dnd is ""Don't Split the Party"". Why exactly is this is a rule? Well, players that decide to explore on their own are much easier to kill, but the main reason this rule is in place is to keep player downtime to a minimum. If the party splits, half of the party sits there doing nothing, while the overworked DM has to constantly shift their focus between 2 or more parties. In the interest of everyone, we choose not to split the party to allow more people to play the game and make the DM's life easier. 

Even with this rule in place, I still notice quite frequently DM's who accidentally leave their players out of the game for extended periods of time. Recently, I had a friend tell me about their Dnd session where they didn't even get to play at all. She was introducing a new character to the game and it was decided that her new character would be at the tavern. While the party was waiting for her to arrive (she was a little late), they decided to go explore a cave. She then spent the entire session sitting there as the party explored this cave without her. The DM wasn't doing this to be spiteful, it was just ignorance. That's why I am writing this today, to hopefully help DMs realize when players are being excluded, and how to give them more time to play.

#Eliminating Downtime

The first step in treating a problem is learning how to identify it. In the case of player downtime, it is very easy to tell when somebody is not engaged with the game if you are looking for it. One of the most common reasons players get excluded from the game is because of roleplay scenarios, in which one person is talking with the DM and everyone else stands around doing nothing. During skill challenges, one player may also be engaged such as the rogue with a trap, while everyone else plays on their phone. 



There are a few different ways to handle players who aren't engaged. One of my preferred methods is making sure that every player has a task that they are doing. In the case of a roleplay scenario, if 1 or 2 players are talking to a noble I'll ask the other players where they are, and what they are doing. Sometimes it's as simple as them saying they are getting a pint at the Squealing Boar, while other times it may devolve into its own sidequest. At any point where there is a potential cliffhanger, I will snap to another player and follow what they are up to until they hit a cliffhanger and then I will jump to another group. The cliffhangers, combined with the speed at which I transition between players keeps them all engaged as they never know when they will be next. This style works for any time the party splits the party, whether it's in the dungeon or in the city.

You can also introduce more elements into the session to get the party to be doing things, instead of just one player. If the rogue is working on the trap, maybe some monsters decide to ambush the rest of the party. If two people are talking with the noble, maybe the other half of the party notice an assassin moving in. Giving tasks to the entire party can help to keep them engaged especially when the task usually only calls for one person. 



Another method that /u/Foofieboo mentioned to me is to let the players take over an NPC while they aren't engaged. While their fighter is getting in a drunken bar fight, they can roleplay the noble and speak to their fellow party members in a completely different light. You can also choose to handwave what happens when the party is separated. Just tell the players what happens, and move on to a scene where everyone can participate. If someone is at the tavern when a fight breaks loose, just say that they show up coincidentally. Dnd is all about having fun, and even if it gets in the way of verisimilitude a little bit, I am much more concerned about making sure all of my players get to play Dnd. 

#Conclusion

Today's article was shorter than usual, but I really wanted to cover this topic as I believe it's something that many DM's aren't even aware of. It's really easy to have a player end up doing nothing for 20 minutes or more if they are quiet, and you are busy trying to handle the rest of the session. As long as you are aware of the problem, and take some steps to integrate the players into the game, your game will really benefit from it. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,53,888,"Hey BTS, sharing some tables today.

This is a quick setup for session zero or anytime your table wants to coordinate backstory among party members. It is easy to do so I will go quick through the steps on how to use the tables and provide a walkthrough example from *The Gollicking* play tests.

Props to u/famoushippopotamus, u/mimir-ion and u/zweefer from *The Gollicking* for assisting with testing and especially with co-developing the omens. Also props to u/PM_ME_PRETTY_EYES for fixing my math formula.

[HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1amZLHCXbGBM9MxKYe5HvLGTP_eM5vHnO) are all the tables in pretty format.

**Generating Party Bonds**

&gt;**Setup** \- All you need is 2d20 per player (and one extra d20 for the omen) so a game with 3 players will need 7d20  (n\*(n-1)+1) where n= the number of players.

* ***Roll the Dice***: Take all dice for the draft and roll them in the middle of the table. This is the pool players will draft from when it is their turn so leave them there until they are drafted.
* ***Draft in Turns***: Each player will take a turn in order. On a player's turn they pick up one of the d20 and use the result of the one they selected to choose a **relationship**, **location**, or **object** from the tables and announce their selection, and which other character that selection is shared with, to the group. That d20 is no longer in the pool and turns continue *until all player pairs have one relationship, and either an object or location to connect them*. There should be one d20 remaining at the end; this is the **omen** for the party.
* ***Check the Results***: Each character pair must have a relationship between them, and they may have either an object or a location, but not both.
* ***Develop the Story***: Now that each character pair has relevant intrinsic (relationships) and extrinsic (locations and objects) bonds the table is free to weave a story together that incorporates them.
* ***The Omen***: After the party has built out the flavor for their relationships, the DM is ready to reveal the omen to the group and begin an excellent story with fully engaged and bonded players.

**Walkthrough - The Lost Tribesmen**

During one of the playtests with three players, the **relationships** drafted from the pool in the first round of turns were 16, 6 and 14.

d20***Relationships***

1. Mutual goal
2. Rivalry
3. Childhood
4. Bound by promise
5. Master &amp; Apprentice
6. Business
7. Vengeance
8. Jealousy
9. War
10. Worship
11. Love interest
12. Siblings
13. Vassals
14. Linked by ritual
15. Incarcerated
16. Tribemates
17. Reluctant allies
18. Drinking buddies
19. Mercenaries
20. Outcasts

&gt;Player A &amp; B chose (16) Tribemates.  
&gt;  
&gt;Player A &amp; C chose (6) Business.  
&gt;  
&gt;Player B &amp; C chose (14) Linked by ritual.

So this has given the table a place to start, but each character pair needs something more, something tangible, to solidify their bond. That is where **objects** and **locations** come in. A mutually significant macguffin that will connect characters to the world as well as to each other. It puts the relationship in context.

For round two, the players drafted 12, 11 as *objects* and 19 from *locations*.

d20***Objects***

1. Old locket
2. Attaché case
3. Alchemy set
4. A lover
5. Brass key
6. A weapon
7. Old book
8. Carved wooden duck
9. Family heirloom
10. Broken timepiece
11. Map of an unknown place
12. A shield
13. Lucky coin
14. A worthless trinket
15. A glass bauble
16. An old bottle of brandy
17. A skull
18. Bust of a deity
19. Ship in a bottle
20. A tattered battlefield standard

d20***Locations***

1. Moonlit grotto
2. Farmstead
3. A far away land
4. Graveyard
5. Castle
6. Local tavern
7. A shrine
8. House of ill repute
9. Tree house
10. A city guard post
11. The docks
12. Guildhall
13. A local business
14. Workshop
15. Battlefield
16. Private dwelling
17. The forge
18. A temple
19. Orphanage
20. The stables

&gt;Player A &amp; B: They are tribemates, so they took a ceremonial shield (12) from objects.  
&gt;  
&gt;Player A &amp; C: They are related by business, so they took a map to an unknown place (11) from objects.  
&gt;  
&gt;Player B &amp; C: They are linked by ritual, and they selected an orphanage (19) from locations.

Here's how the backstory party bond turned out.

&gt;*Dalkon Larson (player C) still wasn't sure any of this was a good idea. He wanted to know what the map tattooed to his back led to more than anything, but giving up his relative safety at the orphanage to go along with two shield brothers, Atemu (player A) and Kogan (player B), heckled at his mind. Sure, a business deal to follow the map and recover lost tribe treasure was one thing, but did Kogan really have to demand a ritual blood pact?*

The only thing missing now is to add a little intrigue to the game right from the start. Take that last d20 in the pool and have the DM deliver an **omen**. For this playtest, the omen die was 10.

&gt;*As the party embarks on this journey, one of you is destined to die a martyr (10).*

d20***Omens***

1. Betray a friend
2. Break a promise
3. Deliver the victory
4. Solve a mystery
5. Slay a king
6. Lose the prize
7. Stop a murder
8. End the world
9. Win a heart
10. Die a martyr
11. Slay the beast
12. Destroy a God
13. Corrupt an innocent
14. Miss the sign
15. Forget the past
16. Break the seal
17. Start a war
18. Yield the future
19. Get the treasure
20. Save your soul

The basic concept of the homebrew is to eliminate the binary nature of Languages in 5e and help make your players' language choices feel more important. If going from ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  to completely fluent does not work well enough for you, then this is for you. 

To do this, each player is given an amount of Lingo Points (LP) depending on their INT ability score and the number of Languages they ""know"" from their race and background. After figuring out how much LP they get, each player allocates these points to whatever languages they know and the more LP a language has, the better at it the player will be at any given language.

Once the characters have gathered enough information they will try to find the antagonist's lair. It's time to build a little dungeon for the characters to explore. Create the antagonist’s  domain. Help yourself a little by answering these questions:

---

- How many rooms will there be in this dungeon? (The amount of rooms to explore depends on the type of lair and of course length of adventure. Usually it's recommended to make a dungeon of about 5-10 rooms for a short adventure.)

- What is the atmosphere of the dungeon like? Is it bright or dark? Does it stink? What kind of sounds do the characters hear?

- What kind of combat encounter will you include? (You'll need some of these to wear down the players' resources like HP and spell slots.)

- What kind of traps will you include? (Adding one or two will keep the party on their toes.)

- What kind of puzzles will you include? (At least one should be included, to give the players a break from rolling dice and let them use their brains a little.)

- What kind of social interaction will you include? (This can be as simple as having to get some information out of a guard. In our previous evil wizard example and interesting social encounter would be the ghost of their deceased child.)

- Not all rooms need a type of encounter that engages the players. The purpose of some rooms can simply be narrative exposition. What will the players learn about the antagonist while exploring his lair?

Peace, Burning",1,Write a Oneshot: The Antagonist's Domain
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,23,382,"One day a large well appears near the party, in whatever location they are currently resting. It has 3' of stone sticking up out of the ground, with a standard sized opening (3'). There is no bucket or pulley, only the well itself. 

The stones are blue with ice, frost, and snow. Tendrils of ice and frost waft from the opening. Approaching within 3' of the well will cause anyone to suffer ongoing cold damage (xdx/round), and touching the stones themselves increases the damage 4-fold. The atmosphere coming from the well's opening is frigid, but not damaging, and the well itself decends 40' before appearing to bottom out on an icy surface. There is no water in the well.

Climbing down through it's interior is dangerous and requires 3 Dexterity skill checks (DMs choice). If the checks are failed, the climber bumps the walls and takes xdx damage. 

This magical well is a portal to the Plane of Frost, and will remain in the area for the next 7 days, after which it will vanish and reappear somewhere else in the multiverse. 

The portal can be closed/banished from the surface with the use of a Meteor Storm spell centered on it. Alternately, the portal's guardian resides in the pocket dimension at the bottom of the well, and if it can be slain or convinced to shut the portal, the well will vanish from its current location and remain closed for X amount of years. 

The pocket dimension at the bottom of the well serves as the true conduit to the Frost Plane, and travelers must have the approval of the Guardian in order to leave the dimension and enter the plane. 

The Guardian is a huge Ice Elemental, and it is protected by a White Dracolich that never leaves its side. Both are bound to this dimension and cannot leave. If the portal is banished, they will suffer no harm. If they are slain, the portal will vanish and remain closed for X amount of years. 

The well never moves without purpose, and the Guardians are not privy to the well's designs. They simply guard. 

### Plot Hooks

* The well starts spewing frost/ice monsters during its time in this place. 
* The well is under siege from forces from the Plane of Fire and was shunted here by great magic. The fire elemental forces will arrive in 6 rounds. 
* The well is the only escape open to an area about to be under siege by Illithid.  
* The well's pocket dimension is the temporary home of a powerful magic item and has arrived in this location to rest, such is the power needed to contain the item. 
* The well has been hijacked by an Ice Devil who's riding it around like a stolen car. The Devil has come to deal, of course. 
* The well is filling with water, and the Guardians are under siege. 
* The well's weather is affecting the local climate and winter has come out-of-season.
* The well currently holds a dangerous creature who is bound and being delivered somewhere. The creature's keeper, however, has vanished, and so have the Guardians. 
* The well's Guardians have been blackmailed by powerful raiders who use the well as a staging post. 
* The well has been taken over by a necromancer for the storing of body parts he's been collecting in order to make the largest flesh golem ever. The Dracolich is under his thrall. The Elemental has no power over him.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,105,1271,"It's no secret that the way feats are handled in 5e is considered less than ideal. 

There are a few that stand head and shoulders above the rest and are considered must haves for certain builds. 

Then there are those that are considered useless, or at least so sub-optimal that it's unwise to choose them over a flat stat increase. 

So why not approach them like treasure, as a reward for the adventurers after completing a mission or doing something where earning a particular feat makes sense? Some examples...

Linguist - not the most popular choice for most builds but potentially very interesting.  You might never see it used at a table unless you offer it as a reward. For example, during the first ark of your campaign your group has delved into the old places of the world and found many references to demons, devils and angels.  Curiosity and the promise of great rewards prompted further study of these languages,  which in turn revealed some information on the nature of languages themselves.  At some point you could reward your wizard or warlock or whoever is appropriate from the group with the feat as a reward. 

Grappler - you're party was defeated,  some unfortunate rolls on their behalf during a difficult encounter, not intended and certainly not the heroic end to your campaign that was intended. Do we just call it quits. Hell no. Next session the characters wake up in the fighting pits. Their gear is gone and they have to rely on their raw strength to get them out of this one. After some Spartacus style adventure where grappling features prominently you reward the fighter or barbarian with this feat.  

Helps players flesh out their characters and I'd say most of them aren't any more powerful than many magic items you'd otherwise be rewarding players with.  

Anyway food for thought, I'd like to hear your thoughts. ",1,Feats as rewards.
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,15,54,"So I've always been hesitant to run my party through large dungeon crawls - for a couple different reasons. (For reference, we play with mini's and I have a big chessex battle mat that you can use wet erase markers on.) 


1. Difficult to track the different rooms and combat encounters. 


I always found it challenging to to describe the shape of a room with enough description to make it interesting *and* then run a combat encounter in it where I've just had to draw out a grid on our battle mat. I'm not really a great artist so even if I describe a crumbling tomb, I end up with a square room. Additionally, there's always this annoying delay where I just finish describing the room and then have to pause the action to draw out the shape of the room while my players wait and then put down the enemies and their minis etc.



2. Keeping combat and exploration equally important in the narrative. 



One of the issues with me describing a dungeon is that the players have to keep track in their heads the size of the rooms. They're trying to keep track of the number of exits, various McGuffins in each room, or I need to draw it all out for them as I describe it, which isn't ideal as not every room is a combat encounter, sometimes it's a puzzle or trap. And then there's the problem that the group is never really sure where the combat encounters are so they go at a slow careful pace and the encounters just become a bit of a gauntlet test of resource management. 



**With that all in mind, I tried something a bit new.** 



When the players entered the dungeon, I guided them to encounter an NPC, in this case a Ratfolk explorer who had become trapped in the dungeon, unaware that the PCs had discovered a new entrance/exit. The NPC traded her maps that she had drawn of the dungeon for knowledge of how to escape. This little narrative plot point allowed me to give the PCs maps that I had hand drawn on graph paper. 



[Check out the maps here.](https://imgur.com/a/sgZ3gKL) 



With these maps, I annotated with things the Ratfolk explorer wrote (in the character of the Ratfolk), giving clues and hints about where puzzles and encounters might be - thus if the players saw something that looked interesting they could determine if it was worth their time to dungeoneer their way there, or if they'd rather head in the direction of the big bad's they were chasing. My hope was that this would solve the aimless wandering (which always seemed to accidentally avoid the cool encounters I would prepare) and give them some agency in the experience so they knew ""hey, we can go check out this room that probably has treasure, but there's probably something nasty in the room before it."" 



It also freed up a lot of time for me! If the party needed to get into a encounter where I needed minis, I would have the players just draw the immediate area they were in - and since they had the graph paper, they knew exactly how big/small to make it. I prepared ahead of time by scanning the maps and creating a B/W version which I labeled the rooms A1, A2, etc and had a legend where I could tell them what was going on in each area. I also wrote down the enemies on my copies so I would have an idea of where monsters might roam or wander as I followed along with the PCs on my own copy. 



I also used an action point system where if the PCs could get through X amount of encounters without taking a long rest, I have them an Action Point - an ability to take a whole additional turn in combat. Again, I wanted to incentive exploration. I had spent all this time creating a cool dungeon, I didn't want them to avoid everything for fear of draining their resources. 



**It worked great!**



The players had fun! I had fun! Perfect! Having my own copies of the maps to follow along with meant I didn't have to keep asking for the map back to examine and determine which encounter was next, and they liked trying to determine what the Ratfolk's scribbles meant in the different rooms. Having the players draw out the rooms also was really handy, usually we only needed a single room or a bit of hallway, not an entire 1inch graph version. So it really saved on buying large graphing paper (which is what I'd usually do!) and since the scale was smaller, the PCs could easily draw a misshapen room or collapsed tunnel - it didn't have to be perfect because they had the map I'd given them as a better visual reference. 



Just wanted to share this bit of success I had, perhaps it can inspire you if you've noticed similar issues with dungeon crawls. ",1,Used this system to run my party through a dungeon crawl with my hand drawn maps
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,40,531," We tend to think that as DMs if we only followed some set of guidelines, our encounters would be fun and interesting for our players. We use words like “balance” when describing an encounter, believing that if the encounter is properly balanced, it will be fun. In my opinion, this is a poor way to think about encounter design, as it emphasizes one part of a larger puzzle to the exclusion of the others. The way I see it there are three basic ingredients to an interesting combat, and once we understand and can apply all three, we can have a better shot at producing consistently interesting encounters. 

Mechanical:

Many of us have some basic understanding of how combat in 5e works from a mechanical perspective, so this next bit might be redundant, but I would like to make this somewhat comprehensive so let’s start with combat mechanics as a jumping off point. The mechanics of combat fundamentally challenge and test the character sheet, thus the enjoyment players experience due to the mechanics of a fight is the enjoyment of seeing a concept work in practice. Remember, your players probably put a significant deal of thought into how their characters will work mechanically, allow them to be good at things.

The design of 5e incorporates a feature we call “bounded accuracy” this basically means that the armor class of characters and enemies don’t change much over the course of 20 levels. It also means that the bonus to hit doesn’t change all that much by design. The intent of this design feature is to allow even low CR monsters to threaten the high-level players so long as they are sufficiently numerous. This leads to the idea of action economy, because anyone can be a threat to anyone else in 5e, the more numerous side is going to punch above it’s weight. Ever wonder why your solo big bad felt anemic against the party? Action economy is probably the reason. 

The other mechanical piece which is rarely talked about, but which is super important to getting creating challenge for the players is attrition. 5e is built around the concept of attrition. Take a moment to read some class abilities, notice how they tend to refresh on some sort of rest. if you only put a single encounter between rests, the party is going to be able to use all their abilities in a few turns, dumping out massive damage or otherwise trivializing the encounter. More than anything, this is the single most common reason that the party will walk over encounters you had intended to make difficult. If you want dangerous encounters, and I reckon you probably do on occasion, you need to put several encounters between rests. The players are risk averse, so it is natural for them to want to rest between encounters, but it is important to prevent it where it would reduce tension. Or minimally to make the players roll for a random encounter so they know there is a possibility that the rest won’t go off and they will be in a worse situation for it. Doing this incentivizes pressing forward to a degree and conserving valuable resources like spell slots as there isn’t an easy, guaranteed way to get them back. 

Finally, let’s touch on CR. CR is a lovely little system which is meant to give monsters an apparent difficulty based on the strength of a four-player party of a given level. The idea is that a monster of CR 8 is the rough equal of an 8th level party of four players. After the previous few paragraphs it should be clear that this isn’t quite right. First off action economy should automatically favor the players in a 4 on 1 fight, and second off, we have no idea how much of the party’s abilities are available for the fight. As previously established, a party with all of it’s resources to spend is going to be far more powerful than one which has used most of their resources or which is trying to conserve them.   

It seems that the more accurate way to think of CR is that a monster of a given CR is the rough equivalent of a party of four players of the same level assuming these players cannot expend their whole set of abilities and assuming the action economy is not considered. The other thing CR often fails to account for is abilities. It tends to factor only hit dice and damage output, not considering the abilities which make the monster more dangerous. This is the reason for most of the most blatant anomalies, take the CR2 Intellect devourer, which can easily kill a high-level PC with its abilities. 

One important note as to mechanical aspects, is that we seldom question why we want to have an encounter of a given difficulty at all. Sure a powerful bad guy should be able to oppose the players both philosophically and mechanically, however we should be able to very encounters from mosquito bites to suicidal charge into the maw of a kraken, and knowing why the encounter is supposed to be difficult or easy goes a long way when planning an encounter. This may sound hypocritical coming from someone who just wrote a page of text about how to make an encounter mechanically difficult, but we focus too much on creating mechanically difficult encounters and don’t consider why certain encounters should be more of less difficult when compared to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mental

A good combat encounter is an interesting puzzle, this isn’t to say the players should be solving sudoku while fighting the demilitch, but interesting combat encounters often have puzzle like elements which add complexity and effect difficulty. 

You diagnose whether there is a puzzle like element in your combat encounter by determining the goal of the fight, usually to kill the bad guys in the room, and determine if there is another factor modulating the difficulty of the fight based on how it is dealt with. The classic example is a troll encounter, the party has the objective of wanting to kill the troll, but how difficult this will be depending on whether they decide to use fire damage to prevent regeneration. 

The thing is, most combats are a puzzle of one sort or another, however if the players always have the exact same puzzle in every combat, they settle into an optimized method rather than experimenting or thinking through the encounter. Thus, more important than simply having a puzzle is having interesting and varied puzzles for the party to chew on. Unlike mechanics, which fundamentally challenge the character sheet, the mental side of a battle tests and challenges the players themselves. Mechanics play a huge part in making mentally stimulating combat encounters, so the line which delineates the two is not fantastically clear. For our purposes, mechanics is the application of agnostic and white room concepts of encounter design, mental design is the context in which these mechanical elements fit adding to the overall complexity of the encounter. 

There are so many possible elements to employ, that I doubt I could offer an exhaustive list, however I will give some types of puzzles and examples of each. I am dividing this into two categories, simple, and complex. Often it is reasonable to have more than one encounter puzzle in a combat. 

Simple puzzles: 

The idea of a simple encounter puzzle is that it is mundane and can be easily applied to many different combat encounters. These characteristics make simple puzzles ideal for the day to day combat encounters, where flashy effects and ponds of laser sharks might be out of place.

Terrain: This comes in four flavors; cover, restricting, treacherous, and active. Cover is anything that a creature can use to restrict line of sight. This can include low walls or rocks up to a thick fog bank which prevents vision past 20 feet. Cover often hinders ranged attackers in choosing targets, but also provides them with a boon because ranged attackers also tend to be better at using cover as they can attack from behind it more effectively than can a barbarian with an axe. Restricting terrain is anything from narrow corridors where the party can only move in single file to rocky outcrops which slow movement. This kind of terrain prevents at least one side of the encounter from maneuvering in an optimal way. The side which can better use restricting terrain can defeat an enemy which is superior on paper by attacking and destroying the enemy in detail rather than all together. Treacherous terrain provides a danger to those it effects, without doing actual damage on a turn to turn scale. This might be a river bisecting the battlefield, if the party wishes to cross in combat, they will need to make an athletics or acrobatics check, if they fail, they lose their footing and now need to make Dex saves to regain it before plummeting off the edge of a nearby waterfall. Closely related to treacherous terrain, is active terrain, this is terrain which actively diminishes a creature hit points just for being near or on it. If you picture a battle in a burning town, active terrain would be a burning part of the building in which the battle is raging. Unlike restrictive terrain, there may not be any movement penalty for crossing active terrain, but the creature will have to spend some hit points. Of course these terrain types can be mixed as needed to produce a layered and interesting encounter. You could have areas of grasping thorn plants which do damage and act a difficult terrain. 

Diverse enemies: If you only have one enemy type in a given encounter the party does not have an interesting choice in terms of who to attack. If there are several different types of enemy in the encounter, it becomes likely that there is an optimal order for killing them. Having this possibility for optimization is the first step, the second is making it difficult for the party to achieve this order. Let’s look at two enemy types in an encounter, archers and meat shields. The archers are the optimal target, they can attack the back line of the party, and despite low HP, have high damage potential if left unchecked. It will take more effort to destroy each meat shield and throughout that time, the archers will be able to harass the squishy wizards and bards. If we position the enemies such that the meat shields can defend the archers, the encounter suddenly becomes more interesting. 

Waves: Waves are groups of enemies which enter the fight in rounds subsequent to the first. These allow for combat to be far more dynamic as the party which was winning is suddenly on the back foot and needing to regroup. It is also nice for the DM as if the players are having a rough go of it, you can send in three waves rather than five, thus dynamically adjusting difficulty 

Ambushes: The enemy attacks the party as it moves. Often the party will be surrounded by numerous enemies, and the enemies will have a surprise round if they beat the passive perceptions of the party. The combination of numerous (generally weaker) enemies and a surprise round gives the encounter high initial danger but as the party evens the action economy out they will gradually rebuff the enemy. 

Complex puzzles:

A complex encounter puzzle is a puzzle which is best employed for a boss battle. It is usually too specific for it to be easily adapted into everyday encounters, but can really add spice to the encounter. 

The fly trap: the boss has an object in the center of the room which can remove players from the fight, it could be as mundane as a tar pit or as arcane as a portal to hell. The villain can use an action to cast a spell or use a spell like ability which can move the players closer to the to the object on a failed save. Conversely the object itself might have an initiative of its own, and does the pull for itself. 

The infinite wave generator: This is a setup where the boss can call upon new minions whenever his original minions are destroyed assuming he is alive. The idea is that the party is usually best served by killing the minions first, as this turns the action economy dramatically to their favor. By perpetually refreshing the minions the boss can keep the party on the back foot. 

The shell game: A shell game is a game involving three inverted cups. An object is placed under one of the cups and the performer rapidly moves the cups while instructing the audience to keep an eye on the cup with the object. This type of game makes an interesting puzzle in a combat encounter. Lets say the party is facing the Dark Illusionist Veidius, he might have several goons all disguised as him and using reactions to cast greater illusion in order to perfectly imitate the spell effects of Veridius.

&amp;#x200B;

Narrative

The narrative aspect of the fight is perhaps the most important for modern DnD. If the players look up In the middle of combat and say “why are we doing this?” you have not properly sold the fight to the players. 

We have several narrative strategies at our disposal, and I will attempt to discuss a few of the most applicable ones. 

The stakes: The party should be able to articulate what they are fighting for with each specific encounter, it can be as important as “we need to get X from the evil Y to save the world” or as trivial as “lets get some treasure” the stakes are important even if they are small because they players need to know whether to fight to the death. If you are frustrated by your players avoiding encounters, you can add stakes to the fight to incentivize them getting into combat. You might let the players know “if you don’t get rid of them now he will be a problem down the line” or you might give one of the mooks a map to the dungeon, such a thing would be very useful to the players and perhaps worth risking some spell slots and HP for. 

The ideological rift: In a sense, a fight is an argument between two conflicting points of view. They may spar with spears and knives rather than words, but ultimately the most interesting combat encounters are so interesting because of the ideology of what the players are fighting for being contrasted with that of the enemy. We tend to assume that the players are on the side of good, and that the bad guys are evil, however I have found this to be somewhat uninteresting. I had an enemy whom the party was tasked with hunting down, they had blown up a bridge to steal a magic sword so the party were pretty sure they were evil. In reality, the enemies were part of a group seeking to destroy the empire in order to bring back the older kingdoms. The party eventually tracked these guys into the sewers under the capital, but once they were down there, they found themselves in a tough fight with some night mantles. One of the enemies rescued the party and led them to the inner sanctum where they could converse. They spoke of freedom, and the need to overthrow the tyrannical empire, they detailed atrocities the empire had wrought on the inhabitants of cities which dared to oppose imperial conquest.  They had hoped that the party might join them, but the grand plan they proposed would result in an atrocity of greater scale. The idea was to see how a good party would react to a group which believed that there were no bad tactics, only bad targets. After much consternation, the party decided to fight these guys, and the fight was pretty fun. 

The reflection: the opposite of the ideological rift, this is where the antagonist is uncomfortably like the players. This is especially useful if the party is morally ambiguous, leaning into murder hoboism. The players might expect that they should be able to join forces with this villain, however this is not really going to work. The idea is that the villain is for everything the players are, and as such is not trustworthy and does not trust the players. This campaign setting isn’t big enough for two groups of murder hobos. If the players are lawful good, a lawful good antagonist is similarly useful. Even the most LG characters will shirk the occasional rule, give them a Judge Dredd to deal with, someone who will never agree that breaking the law is occasionally necessary.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,59,723,"Horde combat in 5e can be very difficult to run but doing so correctly can produce battles on an epic scale that **will** be remembered. Making sure that everything's done properly will make sure that it's remembered for the right reason.

Large scale battles take time so a campaign centered around this style of combat seems a little far fetched but in my opinion an arc finale with 100+ enemies marching across an epic battlemap can create a sense of atmosphere and narrative finality easily on order of any boss battle and above many.

Such situations may happen when: holding a landmark feature (bridge, gate, entrance to an underground lair) against a last ditch attack by the full might of their foes, when attacking into the lair of a malicious organisation orrr... when the guards finally catch up with your edgelord murderhobo... we've all had one.

So how to make such an undertaking run smoothly?

This is my method, feel free to ignore it, steal it or adapt it but leave a comment below if you have any ideas or improvements that might work on other tables.

**Maps**

Firstly, big numbers of enemies want big maps. I use 5mm grid paper and erasable pens, if I want to make something truly massive then I'll tape the underside of several pieces so the squares line up before starting with map design.

You need your map to be designed around the concept in question. 1 thin 5ft corridor may appeal to your lightning sorc but it's not going to give a good feel and you don't really want to run a meatgrinder here. Make sure that there is ample room for the characters and enemies to move around and that choke points can be walked around. Walking around such a point should still give the defender 1-2 free shots to maintain the tactical advantage of such a place but we need to keep things moving.

Place additional objectives onto the map in places that force the players to think about their positioning without making things impossible for them.

**Keeping track of enemies**

There's a lot of them, plan this and make your resources **in advance**.

Firstly, seperate your enemies into sections of 2-12 enemies (maybe more or less) based on the power of the units, putting 12 spellcasters in a row frankly isn't fair on the party, and roll initiative for a group as one.

When enemies take their turns they also act as one. When a 12 man section of Gnolls takes their turn they may spread enough to avoid a fireball but they'll all head up the left side of the map together, this creates a sense of tactical play and, most importantly, means you know where they all are

Personally I use erasable pens on paper and because I'm not using minis I can give each enemy its own designation (G15 written on the map shows Gnoll 15, who is part of group 2 of standard gnolls). If you decide to use minis (and have this many) then consider using bits of post in notes on the base to hold their designation, knowing who's who at a glance is important.

**Paperwork**

Behind the screen I have 2 sets of paper with prepared resoures.

On 1 set I trabscribe the stat blocks of all enemies in the fight but without the fluff. I do this all the time anyway since I hate flicking through the book during combat but in this case it could mean avoiding 5-6 different bookmarks so it'll help.

Attacks are listed as above for fast data retrieval: Longbow x2: 1d8+X (150|600) +Y to hit, special effects are abbreviated down as well

The second set of sheets has enemies written as groups with their designations pre written in blocks. I mark their damage next to their designation. Cross out the old number and replace it as necessary.

G1:          G2:          G3:...

G13:        G14:       G15:...

...

Count damage up, not HP down, adding is faster than subtracting. When damage is more than max health then kill it. Mark max HP next to the block and use the same value for all similar units.

Lastly, for the mages spell slots, make bigger blocks and draw a line next to the corresponding number until they have no slots left, as such.

4. I

3. III

2. III

1. IIII

**The rolls**

I have many dice sets and a good head for maths, if you don't then consider using a dice roller to roll 12+ attacks at once and sum the damages on the 6 that hit. Roll20 is great for this, but lacks the sweet feel of a real die imo.

Lastly, bring snacks and plan a break. It's not quick.

Don’t settle on an answer until it feels right, if you can help it. Once it does, if you’re anything like me you’ll have a much more profound connection to that character. An example I can easily point to is a Sorcerer-King from an old campaign who was the direct descendant of an ancient red dragon. I was struggling to come up with a personality, an *aesthetic*, for this person. I was driving home and Emperor’s New Clothes by Panic! At the Disco came on, and it was instant recognition; it was like I was seeing this character clearly for the first time. They were haughty, they were confident, they were *cruel* and *charismatic* and *vengeful*.

This also works in reverse order, where a song can create a villain for you. I ended up making an entire bayou lizardfolk culture to justify combat with a gatorbard warleader who was, in reality, the personification of the song Swamp Thing by Pegboard Nerds.

This is just me, however, and the real reason I bring this up is as justification to ask all you wonderful, creative folks: 

* **How do you create your villains? What do you draw inspiration from?**
",1,Breakfast Topic: Where Do Your Antagonists Come From?
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,30,390,"This is a rewrite of a post I made to /r/rpg with more details on the actual process.  

I feel that creating maps of dungeons, fortresses, secret labs, etc. etc. to be a tedious process. For the sake of the post, I'm going to call these things Facilities.

I realized that I could (and had) designed pretty good facilities in Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress.  I then realized that I didn't have to do the designing myself, I could just steal somebody else's facility maps and convert it into a facility diagram.  

I was able to convert this amazing DF Fortress:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/8eo91z/anvilrooters_a_fortress_layout/

Into this map that I will be printing for my next session:
https://i.imgur.com/kMrrHPU.jpg

So, here is the step by step process to creating something similar for yourself. 

Here are the written instructions:

1. Locate a Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, or anything you've got that is a grid based facility builder.
2. Open or download your favorite image editing software.  I personally use Krita, it's free and great for drawing.  Really the only requirements are a Pixel brush (very common) and the ability to use layers.  I'm going to post instructions for Krita going forward.
3. Copy your chosen fortress into your clipboard.
4. Create a new drawing created from the image copied into your clipboard.
5. Turn down the opacity on your first layer. (I forgot to do this in the video, but I like to do it).
6. Create a new layer below the original layer and fill it with white (or your chosen background color).  You'll have to hide the original layer temporarily to do this.
7. Create a new layer above the original layer.
8. Select the pixel brush palette, select a pixel brush, and select a primary color.  
9. Select the line tool and set the width to 5 pixels.
10. On the top layer, trace the original map's walls.
11. Turn the original layer off and on to see how things look.  Fix any issues that you see.
12. With the original layer off, draw smaller lines to block off any areas of the map that are not interior.  Things like spaces between walls, things outside of the facility, etc.
13.  Using the magic wand tool, shift+click all the areas that you want to apply a texture to.
14. Select a texture brush, increase your brush size if necessary, and brush all of the texture areas.
15. Using the magic wand tool again, select any interior space.
16. Pick up your pixel brush again and pick a door color.
17. Using the line tool, draw your doors.


",1,How to create facility maps from Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress Maps.
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,340,"Inspired, of course, by the illustrious, irreplaceable /u/famoushippopotamus 


*“One crossed wire, one wayward pinch of potassium chlorate, one errant twitch and kablooey!”* **- The Demoman**

**The Saboteur**

Originally named after members of the french working class in the early nineteeth century who disrupted mechanical production in pursuit of their political goals, **sabotage** is the art of assassinating structures. Saboteurs are those who destroy what others have built, who seek out the weak points and strike with precision. A saboteur may not be able to bring down a kingdom, but they can surely bring down a castle. 

**The Methodology**

*“Now, where was I? Oh, right! Wreaking havoc!”* **- Jinx**


There are three steps to  a traditional sabotage operation:

Infiltration 

Inspection

Destruction

First, a saboteur must **secure a path to their target**. In some cases, this is simple: Turning up in the guise of a tourist or pretending to be a service worker hired to maintain the structure. In other cases, this can be an adventure in itself, navigating the pattern of guard movements, carefully apportioning bribes and sneaking through vents that are clean and big enough to crawl through.

Then, a saboteur must **identify weak points**. These weak points are rarely intentionally part of the design of a structure, rather, they are created by random warping of wood or erosion of stone over time. As such, a professional must carefully inspect the structure, to find out exactly where to strike.

Finally, a saboteur **attacks at the structure's weak points**. Some prefer to exacerbate the weaknesses and wait for gravity and time to finish their work. Others use strong magic, applied with scalpel like precision. Spells like *acid splash* and *thunderwave* are popular among this set. 

 Most use explosives. 

*Ka-Boom!*

*“I don't even think once about blowing things up!!”* **- Jinx**

**A Saboteur’s Kit**

*“Oh, eh, gunpowder, nitroglycerin, notepads, fuses, wicks, glue, eh, paperclips… big ones.”* -**Vincenzo Santorini**

Every saboteur’s kit is different, reflecting their differences in methods. Saboteurs that prefer to use magic might stuff their kit with components whereas a more chemistry focused saboteur will have potions and solutions that they can mix to create powerful acids. A typical saboteur’s kit includes some heavy caustic acid, gunpowder, 50 feet of string, a chisel, fuses, a flint and steel, and two empty explosive cases.

Adventurers trained in the use of a saboteur’s kit can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against a structure’s AC. On a success, the saboteur’s next attack deals double damage to that structure.

**Motivations**

*“Some men just want to watch the world burn.”* - **Alfred Pennyworth**

**Economic**

  A  slip of paper finds it's way on the magistrate's desk. “The cages that you use to contain your zoo animals will begin to fall apart one by one until I find 2000 gold pieces in my hands. Don't believe me, go check on your tigers.”

**Magical**

As part of a fell ritual, the Bloodstone coven needs to perform their witch’s sabbath in the newly created ruins of a church to a lawful god. They enlist the help of a goblin saboteur named Wrinkle to burn the building down before they begin. 

**Political**

**Environmental**
New dwarven industry is coming to the Slashmire wood. They’re building machines out of the very trees they seek to destroy in order to increase their capacity for dwarf-on-tree violence. Nature won’t countenance this sort of endeavour and neither will a young, elven arcane trickster who grew up amongst the beasts and would hate to see his way of life destroyed. 

**Industrial**
There’s a new machine the gnomes have made. Seems you throw leather in the top and shoes plop out the bottom. They’re fully formed and by all accounts better made than the handheld ones. The cobblers of the city can’t stand this new machine and would do anything to make it stop. 

**Military**

Using the invisibility granted by his devastator captain, a hobgoblin saboteur slips silently into the guard tower outside of Pottsfield. In the basement, she discovers a weak spot, applies the explosive and sets the fuse. When she gets back up to the top of the tower, she uses a hand mirror to send a message and her cohorts begin to charge the tower.

Little do the defenders know, if they don’t get into the basement soon, that tower is coming down.
 
 **Watching stuff fall down is fun**
	
A gnomish ne’er-do-well rubs his filthy hands together as he watches the millstone of Parchwood’s horse-drawn mill turn slowly. It’s taken weeks, dripping small amounts of acid in amongst the mortar between the bricks. Now, all it needs is one explosive thump and it’ll all come crashing down. 

**A new roguish feat: Saboteur**

Prerequisite ( Class: Rogue)

* Your intelligence increases by 1 up to a maximum of 20

* Expertise on the use of a saboteur’s kit and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to ascertain a structure's weak points.

* The rogue can spend 10 minutes inspecting a structure,making an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the structure’s AC. On a success, the rogue can apply their sneak attack damage the next time they damage that structure. 


**Plot Hooks:**

The town windmill comes crashing down, bringing the cornmeal production to a resounding halt. As the party watches the tragedy unfold, they spot a small figure darting away from the base of the windmill.

One wall of the party’s home base collapses in a large storm. The wind pushed the wall over and into the courtyard. A high enough investigation check will show that everything else seems undamaged. That wall has to have been weakened somehow. Who’s to blame?

A sneaky halfling asks you to distract the guards while she destroys the bridge over the Tensludge River.

The king stomps angrily into the adventure guild's foyer. “We keep trying to built a new trading post and the fuckin kuo-toa keep blowing it up. Can you please? Can you please do something? I'm so sick of these god damn fish people.”

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,75,450,"Hi everyone! Couple of months ago, I posted my [Eigengraus Generator](www.eigengrausgenerator.com), which was hugely successful, and I thought that I'd post again with the release of my newest update.

For those that missed it, Eigengrau's Generator is a tavern generator unlike any other because it generates paragraphs of content suitable for the DM to read out. That, and it isn't limited to just taverns; it has blacksmiths, whorehouses, markets, sociopolitical climates of towns, and now an instant scenario generator (based off /u/OrkishBlade's tables, so you know it's good!).

I've been working on this for ages, but had constant feature creep; I didn't want to bother posting when I had ""only"" rewritten the code, or ""only"" made a couple QoL improvements. So I'm releasing it now, because it's been too damn long between updates. Bugs be damned, I'll fix them later.

**Link to site: www.eigengrausgenerator.com**

Main features of this update are a scenario generator (hence the name of the update, ""A Man Walks In With A Gun""), temples, and a total rewrite of the code which has allowed for a more flexible system, speeding up development. Full changelog can be found in-game^^^^^^game? ^^^^^^app? ^^^^^^website? and on the /r/EigengrausGenerator sub [here.](https://redd.it/agugjx)

If you find any bugs or weird wordings (I'm well aware of indefinite articles being totally wack. It's a limitation of the software, unfortunately), please let me know! Because it's all procedurally generated, there's no way that I can actually encounter every single permutation. 

If you find this useful, the number one thing you can do to help me, though, is spread the word- share it with your DM, in your local DnD group, on Tumblr, or wherever. Really cannot overstate how much the project needs an active userbase to thrive. We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/TXUa4WY), subreddit /r/EigengrausGenerator, and now also a [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/eigengrausgenerator) page!

Eigengrau's Generator is **open source** and can be compiled from scratch. You can find the GitHub repo [here.](https://github.com/ryceg/Eigengrau-s-Essential-Establishment-Generator) Contributions of any kind are more than welcome.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,123,929,"
I used to watch Naruto when I was in junior high (or whenever it was that it came out). I hated it. The first saga with the village hidden in the mist was perfect, and then the chunin exams were cool, and it just got stupid. One of the many times I'd been disappointed by a show because it stopped doing what it did well and decided to do something new. To surprise us, I guess. 

I hated it but it stuck in my head in ways I didn't even realize. Until now, as I rewatch it with my girl (who is a fucking Naruto fanboy). 

So I want to talk to you about how Naruto ruined my NPCs. 

1 Naruto does magic right.
---

* 5e's magic system is good for what it wants to do. It's a tool for players to use to defeat encounters (social, exploration, or combat). 
* It does not evoke a sense of wonder in me. It doesn't make me think ""Wow, that is fucking sick"". And I don't think it should. 
* That's why, when it comes to designing opponent, or NPCs, I do not do it in the same way a player creates their character. I don't play by the rules.
* In Naruto, each individual ninja has a theme, and abilities to go with that theme that other Ninja do not have. 
* This creates unique encounters with each combination of Ninja that happens to be fighting. ""How will Naruto's demon energy stand up against this other Ninja's eyes, which can literally see everything?""
* This is what I want magic to be *to* the players. 
* When they step up against an opponent, I don't want them to say ""okay, he's a wizard, he's probably got fireball, let's spread out."" I don't want them to think in the terms of the abilities *they* have to combat opponents with.
* I want the players to see things that they can't do. I want the players to see a world outside of the PHB. A world that the enemies opperate in.

2 It all comes back to theme
---

* I said it above, but each Ninja has their own theme from which their powers are based. 
* This personifies what they are in a tangible way. 
* The Ninjas are made up of 1. their headband, 2. their garb, 3. their abilities. 
* This simplicity in design makes it so that when you see a new ninja, your mind races to figure out what they are, because knowing what they are will tell you who they are.
* It's not subtle in any regard, but when designing a new opponent for my party, or a new faction or anything, I think in terms of personifying what/who they are into the things they present.
* Imagine introducing an NPC and casually mentioning that their eyes lack a pupil and are a light shade of purple. 
* My goal is to make the party go ""what the fuck does that mean?""

3 Theme becomes communication
---

* This level of personification, where a person's internal character becomes an outward appearance, lends itself to worldbuilding in the long run.
* The example from above, Neji Hyuga is the Ninja with eyes that lack a pupil. Then you meet another Ninja with the same eyes and things grow in scope.
* A single Ninja with a quirk becomes an entire clan with a sordid past. With its own internal dynamics and personal drama that makes it so much more than just a quirk.
* This is a long term goal when it comes to world building for me.
* If I think of an interesting character, someone who exemplifies these ideas, then I can use that to ask ""what if this wasn't an isolated case?""
* I remember when I would post my NPCs, people would often say that they were ""too anime"" for them. Which is fair, because I'm heavily inspired my anime.
* But part of what they mean, I think, is that having a bunch of isolated weirdos has a very inorganic feel. 
* Whereas, having weirdos who are parts of factions who all share these traits that make the individual *weird*, makes for a faction that can be recognized and speaks more about their culture than just ""some guy with weird eyes"".

4a Backstory as Communication
---

* I've talked before about how finding ways to communicate things with the party is my primary drive when it comes to worldbuilding.
* In Naruto, character literally exposit their backstories to the main characters. This is a standard anime trope.
* But it typically happens in the middle of a battle and is used as a tool to turn the tides, or throw away expectations. 
* I think, when it comes to communicating things to the players, it's okay to do something anime.
* Hear me out, but as a creator, I have so much stuff that I write down. Villains, NPCs, random ideas. But when it comes to sitting at the table, I use maybe a fraction of it.
* I want to be able to communicate to the party so that they can learn about the people/places they are interacting with. And Naruto has some good tools to steal.

4b the Tools
---

* You may not have seen my NPC formula I use
* From here on out, I will allow my NPCs to share what they actively hide with the party, when either extreme of the social spectrum is reached
* True friendship might result in a sit-down chat. Whereas (as is typical in Naruto) a rivalry might form in battle when an NPC shares their secret allegiance, or their dark and twisted past.
* This goes against all the bullshit film school taught me. ""Show don't tell"". Fuck that. School messed with my creative process enough. Part of the fun of being a DM for me is playing NPCs, and what good are they if they aren't talking? 
* Some great times for NPCs to talk about personal stuff according to Naruto: when the party shares something with them, when something traumatic happens, when something makes them really excited, when they are pushed or bullied, when they are triggered by something similar to whatever their secret is, when the story is convoluted and needs to be brought back down to earth, when you prove yourself a worthy opponent (physical or verbally), when you catch them in a dastardly act
* To tie it all together, ""Show don't tell"" is a perfect example of Naruto's outward personification and use of interesting and unique powers. But talking is what we do at the table. So I will now let my NPCs talk.

5 The Powers
---

* If nothing else, I steal awesome new spells and special abilities from Naruto, and have subconsciously done so for years. Here's some of my favorites:

1. Eyes that can see what you are going to do before you
1. Eyes that can copy any move/spell that you perform
1. Pressure point attacks that steal spell slots
1. Summoning a giant, indifferent frog
1. Trapping a demon in someone's tum
1. Replacing yourself with an inanimate object nearby
1. Creating duplicates of yourself
1. A cursed mark that grants you inordinate amounts of power but makes you a slave to the giver of the mark
1. Becoming a giant snake
1. Summoning a bunch of ninja dogs
1. Creating a mirror prison for your opponent
1. Unlocking the seals of energy in your body to perform impossible feats
1. Allowing bugs to inhabit your body in exchange for them listening to you
1. Sand demon that protects you and you have no control over it
1. Giant puppet that can attach itself to a target, giving you full control over them
1. Silent, magical sounds that can burst ear drums
1. Turning into a giant ball and bowling down your opponent

[Here's my blog](https://insidethegiantseye.blogspot.com/). I'm redoing the 5e monster manual over there.

I've got two more books coming. I did a lot of writing in November/December and this month. So all of these books are things I've been working on for months and laying out in inDesign during my free time. I'm learning a lot about laying out a book. If you'd love to hear about my experiences with it, let me know. It's been a fucking pain lol

Thanks to the Gollicking Writing circle for fleshing this out: /u/Mimir-ion, /u/foofieboo, /u/PaganUnicorn.  ",1,The Scene of the Crime: A Generator
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,19,103,"So on r/DnD, I have seen several questions relating to a Party sieging the city. If you need to know stuff about this, but don't care to look through the DMG by hand, I wrote down my interpretation of the majority of it for you nice and organized.

**Bold is major headers**

*Italicized is for subheaders.*

&amp;#x200B;

There are always several things to remember when your party is attacking a city, or when they are defending it.

There are several things we will go over.

Skip to these as you need them.

1. The Party's Reputation in the World
2. City Walls, Bonuses and Reasonability.
3. Guards, Amount, skill level, and more.
4. Places to Conquer of Strategic Importance
5. Actual Tactics in Seige Warfare

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Party's Reputation in the World**

This has more effect than you think. Is the party a bunch of nobodies? Then whether they are announcing that they are attacking the city, or defending the city, they will be treated as such. If they actually do have a reputation this is where it becomes interesting.*If they are Heroes*

If they are heroes and are attacking the city, this could have a variety of effects. This depends on the town. If the town is inhabited by standard beings good-aligned, and a bunch of heroes shows up laying siege to the city, this might lead the citizens and guards to be unsupportive of the defense, especially if our ""heroes"" are renowned for saving many lives.

If the city is more villainous in nature, this might lead to full-blown support of the city. There might be more guards, or militia members fighting against our ""heroes."" There might be traps laid out in the entire city in order to ensnare the party. Some of the weaker more cowardly ones might flee the city. Usually, if one or two members get killed at this point, they might start thinking about retreat.

*What If They Are Terrible Villains.*

The opposite occurs. In a good-aligned city, the citizens would be scared for their lives, afraid that those ""villains"" might slaughter them for fun, or take their livelihoods away. This might cause them to flee the city, or join the guard in order to protect their loved ones. They will probably fight to the last man, in order to ensure their loved ones have time to escape.

If the city is more villainous in nature, it can be hard to tell what would happen. Maybe some of them want to take a chance for power and support the party, maybe some of them are rival villains. It's really up to you the DM to decide this, as it depends on your world more than the others.

**City Walls, Bonuses, and Reasonability.**

Not every town or village will have a wall. And it will be highly unlikely for the wall to be massive if they do. Questions you need to ask yourself before you decide to give a village or city a wall include:

1. Is this a border city?
2. Does this City have a History of being Attacked?
3. How was the wall built?
4. How durable will it be?
5. The Surrounding Area

&amp;#x200B;

*Is this a border city?*

If the answer to this is yes, then this is yes. Most Border Cities had walls, as they were highly likely to be attacked in the event of a war. If they were taken, this would give the enemy a launching point into the home nation. Therefore, walls were built to delay, and give time for the army to reinforce the city if necessary.

*Does the City Have a History Of Being Attacked?*

For instance, say a city was somewhere in the plains and there are vicious nomad horseman (Ahem Mongolians) that attack often. Usually, the city would learn and build a wall. In China's case, they built a wall around their entire country not to keep the Mongolians out. It was to keep the Mongolian's horses out, as, without their horses, they lost the majority of their combat ability.

*How Was the Wall Built*

1. Magic
2. Good Old Hand And Grease

&amp;#x200B;

*Magic*

There are a variety of spells, but essentially, this will be sooooo expensive, so much so that unless the mage owes the city a debt usually you won't see this happen. This will take years to complete with a wall of stone spell. Essentially to complete one 5 foot long section of the wall, it would require 108 lvl 1 casts of the spell, as in order to be viable, most walls are 15 feet tall, and around 3 feet thick. Wall of Stone creates a 1 inch thick 5x5 square of material. at least in 3.5e. Expensive.

If you are however running 5e, it will be far more viable as the spell creates a 6 inch thick wall with 10 10x10 panels. I just realized I was quoting 3.5e so there we go.

This is far more viable than the 3.5e version of the spell.

*Good Old Hand and Grease*

So this would actually be more economically viable, as this will create jobs for construction workers and the unemployed around town. While accidents might happen and people might die by rocks crushing them, at least they have jobs that pay them money. Some of the problems with this include the fact that the wall might be shoddily made, or at least, not as well made as stone walls that are magically connected.

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely the wall might be built with a combination of the two, you decide.

&amp;#x200B;

*How Durable Will It Be*

This can determine a lot of things in your combat. If the wall is shoddily constructed, PCs can probably just push it over. If it is well constructed they will need siege weapons to destroy it. If it is made of metal through magic because the city can afford to hire dozens of high-level wizards, then it will be nigh impossible to destroy through conventional means and must be destroyed through magic.

*The Surrounding area*

Whenever a city builds a wall, for the most part, they will clear back any trees or landforms that block the view of the surroundings from the wall, as to give the Lookouts a clear view for any attackers. If they fail to do this, and the forest reaches right up or within 30 feet of the wall, attackers should have an advantage of stealth checks.

&amp;#x200B;

*Bonuses*

So for the most part, anyone that is defending a wall will yield an advantage to any attack against someone climbing up the wall. In order to facilitate this, I consider that in order to climb a 15 foot tall stone wall during a siege takes 2 turns. If they double move, have them make an athletics or dexterity check to make sure they can keep their grip.

Being on the wall, defenders should probably have a bonus to perception checks if they decide to make any. However, these checks only last for 1 hour of being particularly perceptive, if my wording makes any sense. By 5 hours on the wall, they lose their bonus to their perception due to tiredness and exhaustion. By 8 hours to 10 hours, they have a disadvantage due to their exhaustion peaking. It is far more arduous to be on watch actively looking for enemies than you think.

&amp;#x200B;

**Guards, Skill Level, And More**

On average, there really should be 1 guard to every 30-60 residents in a town. If you have a city of 20,000, you should have a minimum of 334 guards to keep order in the city. Of those 334 guards, close to half of them should be manning the walls in times of danger, and close to 1/4 in times of peace.

Usually, guards of cities or castles rotate shifts, so that a new set of guards arrives every 6 hours. Once there, they stay for 12 hours, so there are roughly two shifts at a time. They would do this in order to maintain the state of alertness. The new guards are watching carefully, while the 2nd shift that's in the latter half of their shift is there to make up numbers.

After they get off shift, they either return to a central barracks during times of danger or go home to rest with their family during times of peace.

&amp;#x200B;

*How Skilled Should the Guards Be?*

That really just depends on the type of city it is. If this is a sprawling city or a capital city, the guards there will be highly trained in order to protect the city from capture. They should each be around lvl 6-10 in my opinion. Lvl 6 guards making up the majority, lvl 7 being squad leaders, lvl 8-9 being platoon leaders, lvl 10 being captain of the guard.

Squads should be 3-4 regular guards and 1 leader. When they group up, 3-4 squads form into a platoon. There should probably be 1 mage in each squad, and it should vary from squad to squad whether its a sorcerer, warlock, wizard, or cleric. There should be at least 2 clerics in a platoon.

A good job for a squad leader would be a paladin, but you could also go the fighter route if you need to.

The Captain of the Guard is expected to take charge in any attack. If you want, you could say that the captain has trained his life for this, and should have a weapon feat. Like Spear Mastery, or Sword Mastery. Depends on the weapon you want your Captain of the guard to have. Most likely your Captain of the Guard would be a high ranking Paladin, as they are one of the most trusted people in the world. *Most of the time.*

Finally in a highly populated city, you can expect EVERY member of the guard to have metal armor, and basically look like the soldiers of Gondor in Return of the King. Excluding where it doesn't fit their class of course.

&amp;#x200B;

If it is a village or just your random town, you can expect the guards to be far less trained.

In a village you can expect the guards to be barely armored, if armored at all, and they will just swing their weapon, not using any skills. At most, there will probably be 2 guards.

In a random town, you can expect them to have standard leather uniforms.

*And More.*

This is really dependant on your world now.

This will depend on what type of monsters are nearby, how prevalent is magic in the town, and what is the general view of magic.

If magic is detested by the city, there will surely be no magic-using guards in town.

&amp;#x200B;

**Places to Conquer of Strategic Importance.**

When taking over a city there are always going to be some places that have a higher priority to conquer.

Mainly these 3.

1. The Town Hall
2. The Barracks
3. The Gate

*Town Hall*

This is important to conquer as you will now have conquered the seat of government in the city. A mayor is a person for the people to rally behind, and taking him out of the picture can quell some unrest in the city. If your players fail to conquer this place, maybe consider having some people rebel later on in the city backing the mayor.

*The Barracks*

The reason why you would want to conquer this is simple. Not every guard will be on the wall when you are being attacked. If the rulers of the city are smart, they will still keep a portion of the troops sleeping during the attack, to be ready to take watch if the attack fails.

If these troops are left unhindered, and the city falls, they might blend into the crowd, and wait to strike at a better time, when it is least expected.

*The Gate*

If the town has a wall, what better place to take control?

With this, you can help cement your authority, as you will know what leaves or enters the city, and if need be you can stop all traffic until the city is under your control.

You can stop reinforcements from entering the city, and stop influential figures from escaping.

If the reason to take the town over is to rob the town of its riches, (I really don't know why my players decided to do this...) Then you can ensure that nothing of value escapes without your knowing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Actual Tactics in Siege Warfare**

So let's talk medieval here.

Back in ye olden days, sieging a castle had become a science. In order to capture a castle without any siege equipment, usually the attacking force would have to have at least 3x the number of troops than the defenders. This was in order to divide their enemy's troops and conquer.

They would usually launch 2 fake attacks and one true attack on the walls of the castle.

This would tax the defender's minds and resources, as they never know which attack was going to be a true attack.

Usually, the attackers would want at the very minimum 5 ladders per group of 50 people. 10 people would carry the ladders, while 40 would be ready to charge. A more desirable number is 10 ladders per 50 soldiers. While carrying ladders, movement speed should be halved, as these are ladders that are 15 feet long, and you don't want to hit your allies with it while moving.

Defenders, if they know they will be attacked, will usually lace the ground outside the walls with pitch and oil, and light it on fire when attackers get near, burning them to death.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a little tired after typing all of this, so I will leave off the other two segments for now. I might type these up later.

*Citizens unrest in an Occupied City*

*The Magic Aspect of It All*

Hope you guys enjoyed reading this!

I just wanted to make life a little easier for some other DMs who have players that want to attack cities.

I didn't really touch the magic aspect of it too much, as I had planned to cover it in its own section, but I typed a little too much.

Roll On.",1,"Resource: Sieges of Cities, Things You Might Want to Know Before Your Party Does Something Stupid Like Attacking A City."
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,59,145,"Hi. There is one thing I really hate and that is having slow combat. Be it because I didn't prepare my monsters well enough or because of too many too slow players, that thing just gets to me as a DM. And then if you throw in an npc that needs running during combat, it just really ruffles my feathers.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking how do I add NPCs to my party and make them easy to run, but also engaging for players from tactical point of view. I want these NPCs to be exciting for players, to be something to look forward to in dungeons. So I came up with this idea. I simply call it Ally NPCs or NPC Allies.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are key things about NPC Allies:

&amp;#x200B;

1. They possess one or two cool abilities that play off PCs. These abilities are usually reactions.
2. Other things they can do are extremely limited.
3. They are controlled by PCs so they don't eat away at DM's mental CPU.
4. They act on the same initiative count as one predetermined PC. They act simultaneously.
5. Their stat blocks have to be as clean as possible.

Here are some quick examples. [https://imgur.com/a/H95qfgS](https://imgur.com/a/H95qfgS)

&amp;#x200B;

Main goal is to make them player run so you can keep DMing, to make them interesting to use, to make players wage their choices in combat and to make them fast and simple. These include minimal rolling. You will notice that Baw'g and Ranger Quinn don't make their own rolls to hit or force enemies to make a save. That is because they play off rolls that PC's make. This both gives agency to players and and also tries to do away with unnecessary rolls. And these are very basic abilities they have. You can really go ham with their abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

But what are other things that NPC Allies can do in combat except their special abilities. I know for sure that they cannot attack. That is not interesting and it eats away at session time. So far, I allow them to use Dodge, Dash, Disengage and Interact with an Object. I feel like these are your bread and butter things that NPCs should be able to use. BUT!!!

&amp;#x200B;

NPC Allies can only use one action or reaction. Not both!

This limits possible micromanagement to a minimum. You want players to use their special abilities or to position them so they can use their abilities. You don't want players spamming Dodge and Disengage every turn.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to skill checks, you don't want players to hoard perception rolls with NPCs. Therefore, NPCs can only use skills they are proficient with. If NPC doesn't have stealth, use group stealth checks and count NPC as a fail, or just say to players in/out of character: ""Hey, I am not a sneaky NPC!"" There is no reason why everyone should be able to move like a ninja.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Ranger Quinn from link above has survival proficiency and it is reasonable to want to hire him to help you travel through forests.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** NPC allies just feel very mechanical. It makes no sense for my ally knight to just stand in combat until condition is fulfilled?

&amp;#x200B;

To some degree I agree, but keep in mind that combat is abstract and narrative in DnD. One attack roll that hits could be narrated as 4 quick exchanges until one lands. Therefore, I don't think this is an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** This just seem like bunch of effects that you could slap on items?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, you sure could. And I don't think that is a bad idea, but this way you can have some variety and cool RP moments. NPC allies might be limited in comabt, but they are unlimited RP wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, reason why I post this is because I have limited opportunities to test this atm. So far, they seem like a promising concept for my personal games. I want to hear what you guys think about them and how they could be improved.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward to replies, I hope I wasn't incomprehensible.

Players like to explore the setting they are in. To make an adventure more immersive it's smart to include some sidequests to show that there's more going on in the setting than just the main plot.

---

- Try to offer at least 2 quick sidequests. If you want to add more, make sure to make them a bit shorter so they don't eat up too much time.
- You have previously created ""Questgivers"". While their main role is related to the main plot, some of them might also offer a sidequest.
- Where can the characters come upon a sidequest?
- Do your sidequests offer something for each type of party member? (Setting up a wagon heist might amuse a Rogue, but usually won't interest a Paladin.)
- Do your sidequests feel distinct? (Remember the three pillars of DnD: Exploration, Social Interaction and Combat. Try to draw from each.)
- What will be the award for completing these quests? (Gold, Honor, Items, Information related to the main plot...?)

Do NOT submit a new post. Write your work in a comment under this post. Remember, this post is only for **Sidequests**, you’ll get to share all of your ideas in future posts, let them simmer in your head for a while.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,44,"Hi BTS,

The Gollicking is clearing out our open project files and we felt like this one was interesting and developed enough to share. This is the first in a series of adaptation templates we are developing for creatures in 5e. While most of these adaptations are designed with monsters in mind, we are trying to also include conditions and effects that could potentially apply to player characters. This project is ongoing, but the first table (D20) is for ***irradiated*** creature variants.

To apply a creature variant, just take the base stat block, roll a D20 and adapt it with effects from the table.

The hope is these creature variants can improve the variety of monsters and flavor in your encounters. Imagine, instead of stumbling into *another plain old boring kobold troop*, players stumble into a den of ***magnetized, phasing kobolds with polymelia***.

Feel free to reply with ideas for other creature templates, otherwise, enjoy throwing irradiated creatures at your party!

**Template: Irradiated**

***Description:***

&gt;*Creatures who have knowingly or unknowingly become exposed to high levels of dangerous arcane energy. Beware these foes, there is literally no telling what mutation to expect.*

**Base Mechanical Changes**

* All irradiated creatures have **radiation sickness** (same effects of rank 1 exhaustion); as well as **brittle** (reduced AC = to the number of mutations, so 1, 2 or 3, unless they have the hardened mutation).

* Creatures with *radiation sickness* must undergo treatment for disease or suffer one (1) additional rank of exhaustion per day until death after three (3) additional days. Creatures infected with radiation sickness gain one additional mutation each day after the first.

* Roll a D20 to determine each irradiated creature’s mutation. Roll for up to three (3) unique mutations depending on just how much radiation the creature has been exposed to (slightly, irradiated, severely).

* Creatures may not have more than one (1) overloaded mutation.

**Base Ability**

*This ability applies for any irradiated creature*

&gt;***Irradiate***:These creatures are dangerous to approach or come in contact with. Direct contact with an irradiated creature or any expelled contaminated substance an irradiated creature produces calls for a CON save of 8 + the base CR of the creature. Failed saves result in *radiation sickness*.

***Variable Mutations***

*Roll a d20 (up to 3 times - max of 1 from the overloaded group) to select specific mutations.*

* (roll 1) **Seborrhoea** - This creature excretes a sticky substance from its pours that enhances its grip; advantage on grapple, sleight of hand and any save involving tactile dexterity (climb, grip, sure footed). The creature has also gained a breath weapon. Once per turn (recharge 5-6) the creature may exhale irradiated breath in a 15 foot cone. Targets caught in the cone must roll a CON save of 8 + the base CR of the creature. Failed saves result in *radiation sickness*

* (roll 2) **Hyperosmia** \- This creature has an enhanced sense of smell; advantage on perception checks to challenge stealth, survival checks for tracking scent and any save involving the sense of smell.

* (roll 3) **Corrosive** \- This creature excretes a corrosive substance from its pours. Any contact with this substance is 1d8 damage to organic creatures and any metal or wooden objects, weapons or armor take a permanent -1 penalty to their primary attributes (AC and damage modifier for armor and weapons respectively) after contact.

* (roll 4) **Energized** \- This creature rolls initiative twice and takes two turns during combat rounds to account for its unnatural energy.

* (roll 5) **Magnetized** \- This creature has become infused with electromagnetic radiation; once per turn, roll a d20: 10 or lower and all loose metallic objects within 10 feet and weighing less than 500 pounds are pulled to the creature, 11 or higher and those metallic objects are repelled 10 feet away from the creature instead. Any target wearing metallic equipment or holding metallic objects must make an athletics save of 8+CR or fall prone or drop the object.

* (roll 6)  **Keen** \- This creature has wildly enhanced senses; they appear clairvoyant and have advantage on any attack, skill or save that involves sensory perception.

* (roll 7) **Regeneration** \- The creature gains massive regenerative properties. Missing limbs regrow within 1d4 rounds and creature regenerates 1d6 per CR (cap 4; creatures lower than 1 CR get 1d4) health at the beginning of each of its turns.

* (roll 8) **Phasing** \- The creature is stuck shifting between whatever plane of existence it is on and the ethereal plane. At the end of its turn, roll a d20, a 10 or lower and the creature blinks out of existence and enters the ethereal plane. At the beginning of its next turn, it reappears within 10 feet of where it was in an unoccupied space.

* (roll 9) **Mitosis** \- The creature has a chance to split and produce two genetically identical copies of itself (with mutations). At the end of each creature turn roll a d20, a 10 or lower and the creature splits into two identical copies of the original form with full health (still irradiated for saves and checks) that act independently.

* (roll 10) **Hardened** \- The creature’s outer skin or carapace has become hardened, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage as well as resistance to effects of cold, fire, poison and acid.

* (roll 11) **Polymelia** \- The creature has sprouted extra limbs to use as natural weapons. Creatures who did not already have bite or claw attacks now have one each per turn (CR+4 to hit; 1d6+CR damage) in addition to regular attacks. Creatures who already have a base bite or claw attack gain a bonus CR+2 to hit and 4+CR damage and an additional bite or claw attack as a frenzied action.

* (roll 12) **Telekinetic** \- The creature has the ability to move objects in the environment. Once per turn as a bonus action, the creature may move an object up to 1,000 pounds anywhere within 30 feet of its origin. If telekinesis is applied to another creature, roll a STR save of 8 + the base CR of the creature; failed saves result in the target falling under the telekinetic control of the irradiated creature.

* (roll 13) **Enlarged** \- The creature has increased to the large size category or one size category up from base if creature was already large or larger. Creatures now large gain +4 to special attacks/damage and a 10 foot reach. Creatures now above large gain an additional +4 to special attacks/damage and an additional 5 feet to reach per size category above large.

* (roll 14) **Bewitched** \- This creature has the ability to terrorize their foes with phantasmal visions. As a special ability (recharge 5-6), this creature may attempt to torment their foe with an illusory creature, object, or phenomenon. Roll an INT save of 8 + the base CR of the creature; failed saves result in *terror*. Terrified creatures who begin their turn within 5 feet of the illusory source of their terror suffer 1d6 psychic damage and cannot move in the direction of the illusion. The illusory effect lasts 1d6 rounds and then dissipates.

* (roll 15-20) **Overloaded** \- The creature is filled with massive amounts of elemental energy. *Creatures may have only one overloaded mutation*.

&gt;15 - ***Sonic***: The creature is immune to thunder-based effects. Additionally, any time the creature successfully hits with a melee attack, roll a d20 and if 10 or lower, the target is pushed back 5 feet and suffers 1d4 thunder damage. On death, creature expels overloaded thunder energy in a 15 foot radius; all creatures in this area must make a DEX save of 8 + the base CR of the creature or suffer 3d8 thunder damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;16 - ***Fire***: The creature is immune to fire-based effects. Additionally, any time the creature successfully hits with a melee attack, roll a d20 and if 10 or lower, the ground around the target ignites and the target suffers 1d4 fire damage. On death, creature expels overloaded fire energy in a 15 foot radius; all creatures in this area must make a DEX save of 8 + the base CR of the creature or suffer 3d8 fire damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;17 - ***Cold***: The creature is immune to cold-based effects. Additionally, any time the creature successfully hits with a melee attack, roll a d20 and if 10 or lower, the target is restrained by frozen limbs and suffers 1d4 cold damage. On death, creature expels overloaded cold energy in a 15 foot radius; all creatures in this area must make a DEX save of 8 + the base CR of the creature or suffer 3d8 cold damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;18 - ***Electrical***: The creature is immune to lightning-based effects. Additionally, any time the creature successfully hits with a melee attack, roll a d20 and if 10 or lower, the closest two targets suffer 1d4 lightning damage. On death, creature expels overloaded lightning energy in a 15 foot radius; all creatures in this area must make a DEX save of 8 + the base CR of the creature or suffer 3d8 lightning damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;19 - ***Radiant***: The creature is immune to radiant-based effects. Additionally, any time the creature successfully hits with a melee attack, roll a d20 and if 10 or lower, the target is knocked prone with a divine strike and suffers 1d4 radiant damage. On death, creature expels overloaded radiant energy in a 15 foot radius; all creatures in this area must make a DEX save of 8 + the base CR of the creature or suffer 3d8 radiant damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;20 - **Necrotic**: The creature is immune to necrotic-based effects. Additionally, any time the creature successfully hits with a melee attack, roll a d20 and if 10 or lower, the target is paralyzed for 1 round and suffers 1d4 necrotic damage. On death, creature expels overloaded necrotic energy in a 15 foot radius; all creatures in this area must make a DEX save of 8 + the base CR of the creature or suffer 3d8 necrotic damage.

&amp;#x200B;",1,Variant Creature Templates in 5e: a Project by the Gollicking
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,55,418,"#*Armor of Agathys*

**Origin**

*Armor of Agathys* gets its namesake from the sixth layer of the prison plane, Carceri. Carceri in 5th edition exists for two paragraphs in the DMG (Agathys doesn't exist at all, other than in the spell's title), so much of this lore is pulled from 3rd edition, specifically *Manual of the Planes 3rd edition* and *Planes of Conflict* a novel by Michele Carter, released during 3rd edition.

Agathys is the smallest layer, made entirely of black ice with red streaks. It is uninhabited except by those who are called the ""Petitioners of Agathys"". These sad souls are those who lied, cheated, or otherwise betrayed someone's trust. They are forced to be nomadic, always moving, or else they will be frozen solid. Their lips are frozen shut, so they can no longer deceive their friends.

The spell itself originated in the 4th edition PHB, being only available to warlocks, which persists into 5th edition (if you leave out the oath of conquest from XGtE). The spell creates a shroud of black ice around you, hurting anyone who dares to strike you at close range. The power of this spell stems from Agathys itself, as staying on the plane would freeze you solid, completely enveloping you in ice.

**Components**

This spell requires all of the holy trinity: verbal, somatic, and material. The material is a cup of water, which must freeze into the hard outer coating around you. The somatic would be you pouring or sprinkling the water on yourself. The verbal is curious though. As mentioned above, the only living beings from Agathys have their mouths frozen shut, as to not speak. Perhaps when channeling power from Agathys, you speak what they wish they could; continuing the lies and deceit they can no longer spout.

**The Spell**

This spell is a great defensive option to prepare while charging into combat... if it wasn't given to the warlock. Sure, at 1st level, it is quite a nice little buff. A static 5 temp hp that acts as a buffer and lasts for an *hour*, and on top of that, if you get hit with a melee attack, the aggressor takes a static 5 cold damage; no save, no hit, just takes it outright. So what is not to love?

Well, warlocks have a very limited amount of spell slots. *Charm person* or *hellish rebuke* are much more popular options, because they are proactive in combat. Using an entire action to armor up isn't worth it for most warlocks, as your action could be better spent doing other things. On top of this, the subclasses allow you to have great 1st level spells to choose instead of *armor of agathys*. The fiend has *burning hands*; the archfey has *sleep*; the hexblade has *shield* for crying out loud!

**My Thoughts**

I believe this spell is best grabbed as a close combat warrior via the Magic Initiate feat. A barbarian casting it right before battle could be a nice bonus if you already have all of your ASI's chosen. He takes half damage, while all who hit him take some recoil damage no matter what. Another great way to get this spell is by the Levistus Tiefling subrace at third level. Then again, GWM, Sentinel, and others would be more beneficial feats. And again, there are just better spells to pick. And as a defensive option, choose a class that has *shield* instead as actions are quite valuable. 

I would like to bring your attention to the [Giant Soul Sorcerer UA](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/UA_GiantSoul.pdf), specifically the 6th level ability, Soul of Lost Ostoria with the Frost Giant type. 

&gt;Frost Giant. Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). But if the spell is armor of Agathys, you instead increase its temporary hit points by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

*Armor of Agathys* now grants ~~15+Con~~* 5+Con temp hp. Now this does not refresh at the beginning of every turn, but a ~7 temp hp buffer is great for a caster that wants to get up close and personal. This is one of my favorite ways WotC has ever built off of a spell. Be careful though; if you cast *ray of frost* or *hold person*, you will have to choose between the AoA or new temp hp. If you choose the new one, you will lose your immediate cold damage, as AoA ends.

**DM's Toolkit**

Cold damage is actually the most common damage resistance and third most common damage immunity for monsters (ignoring nonmagical weapon resistances). This means *armor of Agathys* won't be as effective as, say, *armor of the celestials* that deals radiant damage instead. This means throwing the magma mephit, fire snake, or salamander at the party is all more important, because they are vulnerable to cold. Trade those banshees and yetis out for ghosts and girallons to save those warlocks the disappointment of knowing the world is cold and cruel.

I will leave you all with a Spell Block Text Description to read when your player/monster casts this spell:

&gt;Your hand goes numb and your lips shiver and this otherworldly cold is cast over your body. Your fingers twitch and convulse, and murmurs of lost souls fill your mind and flow from your frigid mouth. Black ice surrounds your figure. As it does, your hands and face glow red with a warmth that radiates through the rest of your body, as if bracing itself for the weight of the ice.

&gt;WHEN HIT: For a brief moment, red streaks appear on your icy armor, that travel up the creature's weapon only to drain the color from its face, chilling it to its core.

Edit: I misinterpreted it to refresh every round, but it does *not*. I fixed my mistakes. (Please forgive me, Deneir.)

Edit 2: /u/stankiest_bean had a great point in the [comments below](https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ag8hty/armor_of_agathys/ee4kabu/)

&gt;Given that warlocks cast spells at their highest available slot, the temp HP and reciprocal damage scales nicely with a character's level. Incidentally, AoA offers one of only a few viable use of Blade Ward known to me. By using it to halve your damage taken, you potentially double the amount of hits your AoA can take, which subsequently doubles your cold damage output.

Edit 3:* As /u/Potatrobot pointed out, it is only 5+Con, not 15+Con. I was still in the mindset of a warlock, not a sorcerer.",1,Armor of Agathys
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,0,46,"# The Pacifist

This druid archetype eschews all forms of violence, refusing to hurt any creature through their own actions, directly or indirectly, and this extends to their diet - pacifists are strict vegans, and only if there is great and dire need (and a creature willingly gives up its life to sustain the druid) will that principle ever be broken. 

Pacifists do not use violence, but that does not mean they do not stand in opposition to actions that they condemn as abhorrent towards the gifts of nature. While they live, no natural resource will be exploited or destroyed, and in some cases, this crusade extends beyond death. There are rare occurrences of pacifists who exist as *shades* - echoes of their former selves (**not the undead creature type**), and limited to *shadow magic* (a quasi-energy that mimics arcane energies but is not as potent). These shades will carry on their goals as long as they are able, and there are many historical reports of these apparitions appearing at some location to sway a dire decision or attempt to stave off some disaster when all other hope has been lost. 

Pacifist Druids are masters of negotiation, diplomacy, and compromise. Though they are not killers, that does not mean they are not formidable opponents. The spell packages of a druid allow for a non-violent opposition, and the Pacifist will use all means at their disposal to steer situations towards a peaceful resolution. 

These Druids will often go out of their way to force an impasse - if militant forces are cutting down a forest for siege weapons, the Pacifist might continually enchant the forest to Entangle the axemen, or cast Darkness over a swath of woodland, or Awaken the trees themselves, so they can defend their lives on their own. 

Pacifist Druids will look to protect nature's gifts over the lives of humanoids, whenever possible. If two armies are marching through a forest towards one another, the Druid will do all they can to turn, delay, or stall the confrontation. Armies and banditry are often opposed by Pacifist Druids, whom they find an irritant and better dealt with by avoiding the Druid's sphere of influence, rather than losing time, patience, and resources to dealing with the constant interference. 

A Pacifist Druid will trade their lives, if necessary, to forestall conflict, if all other avenues have been exhausted. The Druid will (rarely, 10%) become a *shade* (see above) to carry on their life's work in this instance. There has been one documented instance of a *pack of shades* who temporarily band together to oppose some horrific conflict that threatens a large part of nature's gifts. 

A Pacifist Druid has no qualms about interfering in humanoid life. Destroying roads, collapsing dams, driving game away, or other acts of passive-aggressiveness are common - as long as the action will not cause direct harm to the locals. A village with a full smokehouse isn't going to mourn the loss of the local wildlife, at least for the next season or two, by which time the Pacifist will have ether accomplished their immediate goals and returned the resource, or has provided in some other way while still opposing the activity (such as casting Plant Growth on the crops, but still warning the locals to stop poaching).

# NPC Examples

* **Eghil Tench**: This Elven Pacifist was once an Avenger Druid, but saw too much of war and destruction. Now the Druid does what they can to quell local bloodshed between rival factions, and has earned a reputation as a fierce and unyielding obstacle. The rivals have reluctantly turned to diplomacy to settle their differences, but yearn to be rid of the Druid and make war again. 

* **Bobblefield Grey**: This Gnomish Pacifist uses humor and pranks to dissuade bloodshed in their territory. The more the interlopers can be made to look foolish, the greater the chances that they become frustrated and leave without fulfilling their goals. The Druid is fond of Charm and Confusion spells, and has no problem attempting to Polymorph a troublesome foe into something benign (like a rabbit or grinnie)

* **Herzog Yul**: This Human Pacifist has grown tired of non-violence and is on the verge of becoming an Avenger Druid. Fruitless attempts to stop the local monsters from waging constant war on one another has worn down their patience and their temper is at a breaking point now. Any adventurers who are in the area will be met with passive-aggressive pleas to destroy the creatures and put the Druid out of his misery. 


# Plot Hooks

* The party finds themselves stymied by a Druid who refuses entry into a local dungeon - citing the fragility of the ecosystem contained within. If opposed, the Druid will do everything in their power to frustrate, delay, and thwart their efforts inside the dungeon and out (and until they leave the area). 
* The local road has been cut by a deep ditch and no traffic can pass. The party has been delayed by this action, and hears that the local Druid has done this to punish the local leader for disobeying a command to stop mining the nearby hills. 
* The party comes across a strange sight - two opposing armies are seemingly frozen in time. All soldiers have been Held, and a Druid is walking among them, taking their weapons and placing them into a seemingly bottomless sack (Bag of Devouring). 
* A Druid steps out of a Dragon's lair, explaining that they are the emissary, and that The Grand Drake is not interested in a fight with the party, and what can be done to facilitate their swift and quiet departure? The Druid has the dragon's proxy in the negotiations, and if attacked, will draw the wrath of the Dragon itself. 
* A Druid is blocking the way to a monster's lair by casting Mirage Arcana wherever the party goes, in an attempt to dissuade them from committing violence against the species. The Druid explains that the ecosystem is delicate and if this species is destroyed, then the balance of the local web will become violently unstable. 
* After slaying a powerful monster, a local Druid will cast Geas on one of the party members, compelling them to find another pair of the same monster and encourage them to mate successfully in order to restore the population's numbers.

This event's work won't take long. An important part of every adventure is making sure that the players' characters have a personal reason to partake in the story. It will make players much more immersed in the story.

Create a connection between the antagonist and the protagonists (the party). Help yourself a little by answering the following questions.

---

- How are the players' characters affected by the antagonists actions? (*The wizard from the first event might start stealing their life force. A thieves' guild may have robbed the characters themselves. A wild beast may be stopping anybody from leaving the city walls, including the characters.*)

- How will you portray this with the mechanics of the game? (*The characters might start losing maximum health to the wizard. They characters obviously lose gold by being robbed. The fact that nobody can elave the city alls might mean that people start starving due to a lack of food and gaining exhaustion points.*)

- When will the characters be affected? (*I personally find that players are most irritated if they are affected while they are trying to gather information from Questgivers. You can also have them affected immediately at the start of the adventure, to get them engaged right away.*)

- What can you take away from the characters? (*Affecting your players emotionally is good, but they usually don't really feel it until you also affect their characters mechanically. Take away XP, items, stats, anything you think makes sense. You might even want to give them something only to later take it away.*)

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,29,417,"*winter's cold winters bite, a feast not for hunger but spite.  Thy fate was entombed, when their flesh you consumed* - winter court of the fey

-----------------------

# Introduction

Most often when we as humans consider the fey we think of wood sprites, fairies, dryads, and other woodland mischief makers.  Occasionally deadly to the foolish but more playful than devious.  This is not true of all fey as it is clear in the Wendigo.  Previously thought of as a malicious curse only recently have we as ecological researchers begin to unwind the mysteries of the Winter Court.

Wendigo sightings are rising and the cause is unknown.  To understand the problem we need to understand the creature.

-----------------------

# Physiology

----------------------

## Origins

Fey are old creatures and live for ages.  Although many Fey are well known in the material planes little is known about the Winter Court in which Wendigo hail.

We do know that tales of Wendigo come from the origins of the dawn of humanity and the first elves stepping into the world.
Tales of gruesome cannibalism and murder.

------------

## Physical Appearance 

Wendigos are not considered the beautiful creatures of nature like much other fey.  Usually in a more spiritual form naturally they appear as a misty fog flashing red at times.  In this fog, a shadowy humanoid is seen and usually faint whispers and snarls can be heard.  This humanoid form from our best observations is what the physical manifestations in the creatures they possess.  

Wendigo, as mentioned, truly are in a ghostly less than substantial form naturally.  When allowed to enter a mortal body they rapidly shift the host into the form that Wendigos are in physical form.  The physical form resembles a haggard, hairy, emaciated and vicious looking humanoid.  With shaggy white hair covering everything but their palms and faces.  The exposed skin appears pinkish and pale.  Their faces are snarling sharp-toothed villages of violence and hunger.  Their eyes burn an unsettling red hue.

Usually but not always Wendigo are used to floating or flying and are awkward in most mortal forms.  Thus often they will choose to jump and hop in a possessed form in the closest movement to flying they can achieve.  Most humanoids are ill-equipped to consistently hop or jump thus the Wendigo will chew off its own feet leaving sharp points to the bottom of the shins to act as better jumping mechanisms.

-------------

## Possession

In order to take physical form, Wendigos must find a host to inhabit.  There are many tales and methods throughout the years that allude to how this fate can occur but most often here are the usual factors.

* The host is usually starving or at least hungry

* The host is willing to let the Wendigo help them to eat

* The host is in the wilderness and not aligned with Nature such as a Druid or Ranger (although they are not immune just less likely)

* The Wendigo seems to recognize bloodlines and will often haunt the family for eternity

Wendigos are not able to enter a humanoid without their permission.  They can coerce and coax all they want but until the person truly allows them in nothing can be done.  Individuals who have been stalked by a Wendigo in spirit form have spoken of maddening whispers, groans, and whimpers of hunger.  Most often the gaseous form of the Wendigo is hiding among the foliage or high up when these instances occur with the shadowy figure flickering in and out in various hiding spots.

Once a creature is possessed they are typically aware of their surroundings but unable to control their bodies.  They can fight a mental battle with the creature to rest back their true bodies but will forever be maimed as the result of their chewed off feet.  Most often they do not win as Wendigo are extremely powerful when it comes to such battles of will.

------------------------

## Insatiable Hunger

Wendigo themselves do not need to eat.  Instead, they are maddeningly envious of the pleasures of physical beings and food.  Most notably meat.  While they will wholesale slaughter local wildlife they most often enjoy the flesh of sentient humanoids as to savior their ""play"".  Eventually, they will devour all in an area and move onto another area to fill this hunger.  

Even after eating large amounts of food a Wendigo will stuff itself.  Often regurgitating from over-eating they can be seen with red stained fur on their fronts mixed with dried vomit.  They are not a clean creature in physical form.  They will continue to eat though and with abandon.

One peculiar thing is that they never eat the eyes of a victim.  When querying as to why to some other creatures of the fey-wild it seems to be an unknown factor to others as well.  The obvious parts like bones and other remains are too hard to eat, but their eyes are usually what scavengers and other animals prefer due to their ease of access.  As of yet, there is no conclusive answer to this mystery but tests have shown that even eyes lain out for easy picking by a Wendigo are not only ignored but actively avoided.

------------------------------

## Life Cycle

As with many true-Fey Wendigo do not have a lifespan.  They are not immortal but they do not age.  Instead, they can only be slain.  This makes for what would have been a larger amount of Wendigo in past times but as their numbers inevitably dwindle they are possibly on a path to true extinction.

Wendigo do re-produce or grow in number.  They are all the same age it seems and have vast but severely fragmented memories of all time.  Wendigos are all wise beyond the oldest elves from age and experience though and have avoided extinction thus far by keeping to the remote places of the worlds.

---------------------

## Likely Habitats

Wendigos are certainly in the Faeverious (or the home plane of the Fey) but do not stay there long.  Un-interested and unable to trick and play with their own kind they constantly try and find ways out of their home plane.  This is much akin to a demon it seems where they long for easy targets and avoid contact with others of their kind.  However even when escaping their home planes they most often keep to remote regions.  Usually, they have been found in arctic or at least colder regions of the material planes.  These areas are most often at least on the borders of some civilization though as possessing animals is considered too easy.  Although there have been tales of a frenzied flesh eating elk or 2.

---------------------------------------

# Intelligence and Social Behavior

---------------------------------------

## Intelligence 

The ravenous spirits are very cunning and highly intelligent.  They are great at setting traps, avoiding contact, and even convincing mortals of things well past their usual comfort zones.  Mistaken for 1 track killers by some they can easily outwit even the craftiest hunters.  They know the dangers of being caught and will do their best to keep their identity hidden.  Their hunger has betrayed them at times though and this is how they are usually caught.

----------------------------------------

## Communication

Not very talkative to prey, but they will utter taunts and jabs in Sylvan for their own amusement.  They know many languages but rarely know the proper syntax or local dialects and slang.  This can be a tell if a Wendigo is attempting to keep a low profile when amongst prey they can be seen as anti-social or aloof.  This isn't a well-known fact but towns who do know of this danger can sometimes be a little to xenophobic and end up putting out the wrong individual at times.  

When a creature such as another fey talks to them they can be a little more revealing.  Often times they gleefully tell of their current endeavors with no fear of interruption.  They will chatter on endlessly thus usually annoying other creatures to the point of leaving them quickly.  

---------------------------------

## Evil or Innocent

By no stretch of the imagination, a Wendigo would be considered evil to mortals.  Murder, slaughter, and complete lack of compassion are the key marks to these spirits being considered evil.  By all purposes of mortal society, they are creatures best avoided and even better put down.  

One fact does make them different from pure-evil such as demons.  Wendigos see this all as play and quite innocent play to them at that.  Creatures of nature in their true thoughts consider nothing important but the prosperity of nature itself.  Toying with the would-be destroyers of the forests and other natural endeavors is to them a good thing.  

Many other Fey do not agree with or condone their methods but most Wendigos truly think nothing remotely evil of their actions.  Nievity or other forces could be at play here, but it's hard to ignore the complete lack of compassion for mortals as a result.  It defies much of what most sentient creatures think of as morality.  Interestingly enough though, druids often ponder how most treat insects is how a Wendigo treats a human.

---------------------------------------------------------

## Loners Out For Themselves

Wendigos are not very sociable creatures.  In fact, if anything they despise operating with or around other Wendigo.  Each one has their own unique methods and tells when torturing humanoids.  Due to this, they feel no other Wendigo can help and instead is a direct hindrance to their play.  This normally doesn't come to blows but fights between Wendigo are not unheard of.  These fights are not open ones but instead 2 disguised Wendigos trying to oust each other while attempting to keep their own meddlings behind the curtains.  This can turn into decade long games of cat and mouse if left unchecked.

-----------------------------------

# Wendigos and Other Creatures

------------------------------------

## The Winter Court

The Winter Court, as we are discovering is the more brutal and violent side of Nature.  Wendigos are just one member of many Fey who makes up the Winter Court.  Agents, as they are called, are respected but ultimately left to their own devices.  When nature is waining and drastic measure for it to fight back are needed most often you can find more than just Wendigos starting to haunt the areas of the wilds.

That said Wendigos are not particularly friends with other agents and find themselves still avoiding contact once set out.  They are after one thing stop the encroachment of society, and Wendigos are the best tool for the job.  At least they certainly believe so.

----------------------------------

## Dryads

Driads are known to be mischevious but ultimately fair and decent fey, especially to with Elves.  However, Wendigos and Driads are not friends in the slightest.  Driads while not overtly good, do not enjoy slaughter or such acts.  Thus if a Wendigo is in operation near a Dryad they will often attempt to warn nearby humanoids in their own fleeting way.  Wendigos most often see this is another layer to the challenge that is their ""play"" but can tire of the opposition when loosing.  They will attack the Dryads in many ways but never in such a way that would harm the natural surroundings.

----------------------

## Lycanthropes and other Therianthropes

Wendigos are not particularly fond of individuals who are afflicted with or born with Therianthropy.  However, they are quick to point to them and frame them when their fun can be spoiled.  Unlike Wendigos, Lycans and other were-beings are not necessarily in their whole frame of mind most of the time during a heinous murder, and often will have more animalistic reasons for killing.  It's easy enough to the trained eye if a Wendigo or a Werewolf tore apart a victim but to most, they are one and the same.

---------------------------------

## Will-O-Wisps

One creature Wendigos particularly are fond of is the mysterious Will-O-Wisp.  These strange yet ultimately dangerous creatures lure and captivate most humanoids with ease while Wendigos work hard to solve the puzzle of ruining a town as slowly as possible.  While keeping their distance it's not uncommon for a Wendigo to be around these lights when they cross paths.

------------------

## Humanoids and Other Material Plane Dwellers

Wendigos see most sentient beings as mere play-things and destroyers of nature.  They hold little remorse or thought of the well being of any sentient mortal life.  However, they revel in their torture and fun with humanoids more than any other.  In all known cases Wendigos are nothing less than hostile, aggressive, and downright evil towards any sentient Material Plane life.

Even when bested they merely cackle knowing they will return.  Though if truly killed they are nothing less than furious and explosively violent in their final moments.  One group of Elven rangers described when they dispatched a Wendigo truly, the experience as anything but enjoyable.  With curses, promises of death, and violent and hideous language the loss to a mere mortal is the ultimate frustration.

-------------------------------------

## Battle Tactics

Wendigos are subtle and elusive creatures, however, when in combat they are quite the opposite.  Frantic in movement never staying in one spot Wendigo in possessed forms are quick and brutal.  With increased speed and strength imbued into the host, they aim to quickly dispatch a foe and move onto the next.  This doesn't stop them from feeding though.  Slain foes often will quickly have parts or even whole limbs tore off in a moment and devoured mid fighting.  This scare tactic can be quite effective although I suspect it is simply them satiating their hunger.

Wendigos in spirit form aim to quickly possess a target.  Having no real good way to openly fight in spirit form they recognize their disadvantage when fighting foes, especially wizards, and their ability to be harmed regardless of state.

--------------------------

## Hungering Stones

Some clever wizards and other beings of magic have learned how to harness a Wendigo trapped within a stone or crystal.  These stones are not widely available and are simply just a prison.  However, tales of these stones being plunged into a host give direct and immediate possession of a host and even can be enhanced if the prisoning stone was enhanced to do so.  The nature and reasoning for doing such a dark act is beyond my understanding.

--------------------------------------

# Variations

---------------------------------------

## Polar Wendigo

The most common and what I would consider the base of the creature's knowledge is that of the Polar Wendigo.  White, strong, and largely immune to cold the dangerous predators stalk the remote frigid lands of the realms.  The most ancient of writings always speak of the burning red eyes in the dead of winter.

--------------------------

## Cave Wendigo

The Underdark and other large networks of tunnels can be remote and often claim those who survive the subterranean horrors with hunger.  Cave Wendigo are hairless and with long ears able to pick up sounds in cave systems better than many other creatures.  With absolute vision when possessing a host they can even locate invisible creatures giving the edge against even fellow Underdark residents.

----------------------------------

## Wasteland Wendigo

These Wendigos are terrifying to see.  Often roaming deserts and other wastelands looking for hosts they often overpower prey far easier with little to no food naturally occurring in such environments for untrained or even trained humanoids.  When possession takes place they are black haired and more hulking figures than other Wendigo.  With tremendous wails that shake the will of creatures for many miles and increased sizes ranging up to 15 feet tall, they are best avoided if possible.  

--------------------------------------------

# DM's Notes

Wendigos are a challenging monster on many levels.  However, if just used head to head with no intrigue they end up being a bland fight.  Wendigo can make for brilliant murder mysteries, spooky horror adventures, or even creepy encounters with fog in the woods.  As with all monsters, even ones far less intelligent than that of a Wendigo remember to treat any monster as you would an NPC, with their own agenda, motivation, and way of thinking.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,44,349,"I got Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica for Christmas, and while I love most of what's included, I felt many of my favorite Ravnica Legendary creatures deserved their own stat blocks rather than just honorable mention's in the book's sidebars. So I went ahead and took a crack at them myself. 

As I went on, I decided to go ahead and make every living Legendary (in MTG terms, not D&amp;D terms) creature from Ravnica that could ostensibly still be alive when GGR takes place. 

Typically I started with existing monsters' stat blocks and went from there. For example, Tajic is a Boros Firefist with a few extra levels and a +3 flame tongue greatsword. Etrata is largely the assassin from the MM mixed with the vampires in GGR.  I also created a few special abilities, like Izoni's *Thousand Eyes* passive, to represent the characters' lore and MTG card mechanics.

I'm sure many of Challenge Ratings are not very accurate, so take those with a grain of salt and decide for yourself.

It seems to happen relatively often for me. But keeping NPCs as party members bogs combat down incredibly quickly. Especially when they all have different weapons and bonuses. Too much to keep track of.

Obviously it’s more suited to one big enemy, but you can always copy sheets and set up multiple enemies. 

It also has a distance/time converter so you’ll know how long it’ll take to walk e.g. a mile at 30ft/round. Less useful generally. I originally made it for my old DM, who liked to operate at the highest mathematical precision over really long-distance maps. It bogged the game down hard.

&gt;“Nihilists! Fuck me… I mean, say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it’s an ethos.”

— Walter Sobchak

Having now explained the core concepts of the two axes, we can attempt to define each alignment individually. The most common way this is done is with characters that serve as examples (which usually sparks fierce debate). I’m going to try to find perfect examples of every alignment, that no matter how you interpret the alignment these characters will still fit. Even so, we’ll inevitably run into some points of contention.

Lawful Good: [FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper](https://imgur.com/a/2XRxkT5), *Twin Peaks*. He fights the forces of darkness from his position as a law enforcer. Always abides by the law and acts in compassion and protection. These things don’t really come into conflict with each other, they align quite nicely. If you haven’t seen *Twin Peaks*, feel free to substitute Chris Traeger from *Parks and Recreation* or Commissioner Jim Gordon from *Batman*.

Neutral Good: [Jesus of Nazareth](https://imgur.com/a/hDLX7pn), The New Testament. Now, anyone who could be considered a vigilante is tricky to place because their existence calls into question the ethical code of this system. I chose Jesus because the story from which he comes frames his every action as supposed to be purely Good, regardless of questions of ethics. You could, as an audience member, certainly bring to your reading a lot of questions about the Lawfulness and Chaoticness of Jesus’s actions, but the text itself doesn’t really offer anything to say about that. As far as it’s concerned, everything he ever did was Good, Good, Good.

Chaotic Good: [Robin Hood](https://imgur.com/a/ayHyowe), English Folklore. He robs from the rich and gives to the poor. The pinnacle of rebellious altruism. You could argue, though, that he is only *contextually* Chaotic. If King Richard were on the throne, then would Robin be Lawful? It’s tough to say, and it varies from one depiction to the next. This is an example of the subjectivity/objectivity of ethics being an issue in helping us agree on something.

Lawful Neutral: [Jack McCoy](https://imgur.com/a/D4QdmIa), District Attorney for the borough of Manhattan, *Law &amp; Order*. He enforces the letter of the law, condemning both Evil and Good people.

True Neutral: [Dr Manhattan](https://imgur.com/a/3gctXfr), *Watchmen*. He is completely apathetic about all things and has come to abandon ideas like morality and ethics. A lot of the time he removes himself from the situation, but when he is involved he lets himself be commanded for both Evil and Good, the Law and Chaos.

Chaotic Neutral: [Bugs Bunny](https://imgur.com/a/mapHNF5), *Looney Tunes*. He deliberately opposes all notions of order, logic, and authority. I can’t think of a time he did anything specifically Good or Evil, but he definitely prioritizes Chaos in practice and in principle, in major action and minor. Another common example people give is Jack Sparrow, but he doesn’t fit as well as Bugs. Don’t get me wrong, he’s probably Chaotic Neutral overall, but he does adhere to the Pirate Code. This isn’t insignificant, either. Jack’s personal adherence to that Lawful institution was an incredibly important plot point in *The Curse of the Black Pearl*.

Lawful Evil: [Darth Vader](https://imgur.com/a/VSlGigx), *Star Wars*. He is cruel and violent, selfish and hateful, yet organizes himself and his actions through a deliberate logic and rule of law. Authoritarianism is considered Lawful Evil in almost all cases.

Neutral Evil: [Voldemort](https://imgur.com/a/0jHnSvW), *Harry Potter*. He aspires only to Evil things, willing to work within the system or without, depending on which is better suited to his needs. I really like Neutral Evil villains, but they’re a bit tricky. Back in the day, people would often list things like the Xenomorph from *Alien* as Neutral Evil, but because it’s really just an animal operating on instinct it would probably now be considered Unaligned. Threatening and probably fine to kill, but still Unaligned. A lot of Neutral Evil villains end up being villains which have traits of both Law and Chaos (like Voldemort or, say, Aku from *Samurai Jack*), but some are just platonically Evil because the work never asks any questions about ethics (similar to the Jesus example).

Chaotic Evil: [The Joker](https://imgur.com/a/taIeevc), *Batman*. The best example is Heath Ledger’s, and it truly is a perfect example. It’s even discussed at length in *The Dark Knight*. While he almost exclusively discusses his feelings about ethics, his interpretation of Chaos always has an Evil bent. He claims to be an agent of Chaos, but notice he never does anything Chaotic *Good*. He never randomly pays the bills of every patient in a hospital just to screw with the system. Instead he screws with the system by blowing hospitals up.

The main issue here is that most characters don’t fall into such extremes as the ones above. A lot of them fall into a middle ground between two alignments, or they have attributes pulling them in opposite directions. The other issue is to figure out what exactly determines where you fall. A common example brought up to contest the accuracy of this system is Batman. Depending on how you interpret him, he could potentially fit under all alignments. He is violent and protective. He enforces the law while simultaneously breaking it. He seeks to impose a system of order, but uses deception to combat his enemies. He believes that life is sacred but will torture people. At various points, the creators of D&amp;D have tried to explain the alignments themselves and provide examples, but they are often inconsistent, self-contradictory, or just clearly wrong. In a 3rd Edition sourcebook titled *Complete Scoundrel*, they list Batman as being Lawful Good. And sure, if they’re talking about Adam West’s Batman (who wasn’t, like, *really* a vigilante and was always altruistic) then that’s probably accurate. But they also list Zorro as being Neutral Good, despite being the inspiration from which almost all of Batman’s attributes are drawn. Seriously, almost every factor in Batman’s life that would contribute to his alignment are shared with Zorro. They’re both rich, pretend to be dumb playboys, are secret vigilantes, have a cave hideout under their mansions, and have a loyal butler as their main ally. Whatever their alignment is, it *has* to be the same thing.

They also list Odysseus, one of the most famous trickster figures in the western canon, as Lawful Neutral. Now let me tell you, I’ve read a lot of classical writing but I can’t quite figure that one out.

They list Malcolm Reynolds from *Firefly* as Chaotic Good, even though this is a major simplification. Mal’s main story arc is his personal struggle between being Chaotic Good and Chaotic Neutral, specifically whether or not he should help people or only mind his own business. To reduce him to one alignment would be to take away his main characteristic. However, a lot of Players in D&amp;D will define themselves under one alignment to begin but intentionally start drifting toward another alignment, writing themselves a character arc like Mal’s.

Our most valuable takeaway is this: characters are rarely simple. They aren’t going to be 100% a single alignment. There are a lot of different ways to try to read alignment in people. We’ll find ourselves breaking that down in detail in [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ai30ku/character_alignment_part_4_tricky_questions/?), where we’ll identify two questions that are rarely asked but often incredibly important in understanding disagreements in alignment.",1,Character Alignment Part 3: Archetypes and the “Official” Categorization

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,24,94,"I was recently inspired by this post about [politics and crime](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/adja22/politics_crime_the_legislature/) to think more closely about how my punishment in my own world, the Frontier, works. It is a highly feudal system, heavily inspired by English and Scottish law in the 13th and 14th centuries. I used Ian Mortimer's excellent book, *Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England* as my source. Here's what I came up with:

# Preamble

Before reading on, it's helpful to ingest a bit of the jargon surrounding medieval geography and feudal hierarchies. England, Scotland, and Wales were divided up into large land-areas called counties, which still exist today, in many cases with similar boundaries. These counties were further divided up into areas called hundreds (in the South), or wapentakes (in the North; the word I use for my world). Each wapentake would most likely contain several towns and small villages, and be ruled by a lord. In my world, the Wapentake of Kilinn, the area in which most adventures take place, is ruled by Lord Blackwood. Such a lord may own several manors (a manor house with surrounding fields) in his wapentake. The fields in each manor are worked by the villeins, whose labour is effectively owned by the lord. They are not allowed to leave the manor, although they can pay a fee to avoid working, if they somehow have enough money. In return for their labour, they get to keep a proportion of the crops they harvest, enough to keep them alive. It's no surprise that some villeins chose to escape this gruelling existence by fleeing to a town to hide from their lord. If they could remain in a town for 100 days without being caught, they became freemen of that town, and escaped the feudal hierarchy!

# Law Enforcement

The law enforcement on the Frontier is harsh. Gallows stand at crossroads, holding the swinging bodies of thieves. In the town square, fraudulent traders languish in the stocks.

To enforce this law, every male villain between 12 and 60 is a member of a tithing. Each man has made a ‘frankpledge’ to follow and uphold the law. Each tithing consists of around 10 men. If one of their number, or a person in their area breaks the laws, it is their responsibility to deliver the culprit to the constable of the township (on The Frontier, each village and manor is a separate township). A tithing is led by the chief tithing-man, or ‘capital pledge’. It is his responsibility to see that no wrongdoers are let off. If the tithing protects one of their number from justice, they are fined very heavily. The constable reports crimes within the township to the wapentake bailiff at the wapentake court.

When someone discovers a crime, they must make an agreed sound known as the ‘hue and cry’. Each sound is unique to the general type of crime discovered. All those in the vicinity are expected to pursue and apprehend the criminal. Whether or not he is caught, the crime will be reported at the next wapentake court, and all the nearby tithings are made aware of the crime, so that they too may try to apprehend the criminal.

If the crime is serious enough, the sheriff (of the county, which contains multiple wapentakes), will be informed. He will then call out the posse comitatus, a group of armed men who will pursue the criminal until they are caught. A criminal evading arrest may be beheaded on sight, assuming that the coroner is present, and that the wanted man has not reached the sanctuary of a church (although particularly hated criminals have been known to be dragged out of church for execution). Women are forcibly drowned.

The wapentake holds a court every three weeks. The bailiff empanels a jury of twelve freemen to hear all the presentments. Minor crimes, such as small fights, and disputes over debt, are dealt with then and there. Larger crimes such as murder or grievous wounding must wait for a special wapentake court, the sheriff’s ‘tourn’, which occurs twice a year, on important holidays.

Crimes that only affect one manor may be dealt with in a manorial court by the local lord. For example, a villein who allows a stream to become blocked and flood the fields could be fined without going to wapentake court. However, if the stream also floods the neighbouring lord’s land, the crime must be taken to the wapentake court. Similarly, the crimes of freemen are always tried at wapentake court, as they are outside of the frankpledge system. Manorial court is run by the lord of the manor.

Lord Blackwood’s manor has the rights of infangenthef, and outfangenthef. This means that he has the right to hang thieves caught red-handed (with goods in their possession) without referring the matter to the bailiff or wapentake court.

Local justice is designed to find someone guilty, whether or not they committed the crime in question. When accused in county court, one can appeal by trial of combat, and prove one’s innocence by defeating one’s accuser. Having been found guilty, one can name others as accomplices, who will then also be tried, and quite possible hanged also. Corruption is rife within the system, and officials are known to take bribes on a fairly regular basis. If accused of a crime worthy of trial at tourn, one can be imprisoned without trial for up to six months.

# Punishment

For everyone but the most most important nobles, imprisonment is not a punishment; a prison is merely where criminals awaiting trial are stored. As a result, crimes are either serious enough to warrant execution, or trivial enough to warrant a fine. There is little in between. Although thieves sometimes have their hands cut off, they are much more likely to be hanged. Beheading is seen as a more prestigious form of execution than hanging, and is therefore reserved for nobles.

It is surprising what sort of crime can warrant execution. A villein might well be hanged for the theft of 16 eggs, and no-one would protest the injustice. In general, punishments seem harsh, but brutally efficient; it usually takes only a day or two for a thief caught red-handed to be seen hanging from the noose.

On The Frontier, banishment is sometimes used as a punishment. A banished person has outlaw status. This means that they are literally outside of the law. That is to say that anyone can harm them in any way with impunity. In addition, banished persons may not enter any towns or villages, and may not receive help from any citizen of the Kingdom. Such people usually die in the wild, so banishment is seen as little more than an extended death sentence, particularly if the person in question has enemies in the community.

# Summary of Roles

* Sheriff – Responsible for law and order at county-level. Runs a bi-annual tourn in each wapentake of the county.
* Bailiff (of a wapentake court) – Responsible for law and order at wapentake-level. Deals with trivial crimes at wapentake court, and holds criminals accused of greater crimes until a tourn.
* Bailiff (of a manor) – Selected by the lord of the manor, and present at all manorial courts. Collects fines, rents, and maintains law and order on the manor. May run manorial court.
* Steward (of a manor) – Appointed by the lord to look after the lord’s home and lands. When the lord is away, the steward runs the manor. The steward also runs the manorial court in co-operation with the bailiff or reeve.
* Reeve – Responsible for law and order at manor-level. Elected by the villeins, and deals with disputes and crimes that only affect the manor. Also responsible for the sale of produce, and, in co-operation with the bailiff, the collection of monies and payment of accounts. May run manorial court (either bailiff, or reeve).
* Constable – Responsible for law and order at township level. Receives criminals from the chief tithing-men and reports crimes to the bailiff.
* Chief tithing-man (capital pledge) – Heads a tithing, answers to the manorial court, and liaises with the constable of the township.
* Tithing – Consists of around 10 villeins who live in close proximity. Each is responsible for the others’ good behaviour.",1,Crime &amp; Punishment in a Feudal Society
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,112,1171,"Here begins my tribute to repay all I have gained from this subreddit:

What if your players dont find a Room you wanted them to Find in a dungeon? Here's what to do.

**Near the Beginning of the Dungeon**

So, imagine you have some hidden room, hidden near the beginning of the dungeon, and the players roll perception/investigation/whateveryouchoosetocallit, and they don't make it.

No big deal, say they find a nice vase or whatever and watch them study it, thinking it's the key to something.

Then later in the dungeon, you can give them more chances to find the room, by moving the room in your dungeon plan.

There is no need to flip the table or to bang your head on the table because they missed the room.

Remember, in most cases, the party doesn't know the dungeon as well as you do, (unless they managed to get a map, but then they wouldn't have missed the room most likely, and if they did, roll perception to see if they can see through the slightly weakened illusion on the map etc etc.) so you can alter the dungeon as you see fit.

Now, I don't recommend altering the dungeon in order to make their lives hell. No. Just No. You are becoming a chaotic Evil DM. We want a Chaotic Good DM.

I have been in several groups, where the DM was a cruel, cruel person, and would say that enemies appeared behind us. From a tunnel in a room, we checked before. And we rolled a nat 20. Don't be this person, even if it is important for the story. If you need to overwhelm your party for the story, maybe say that a patrol is returning back to the dungeon (if its, for instance, the base of an enemy) or double the enemies in front of them.

**What if they Miss it Near the End of the Dungeon?**

In this case, what you need to do is ask for their passive perception, and their most perceptive one will see a rat going through an illusion covering the door that they missed. I've done this before for several years and no one caught on.

**What if they STILL don't want to go through the door?**

Well, consider before doing the next steps I'm about to say,

Is this really necessary?

Will this make the experience more enjoyable if they find out after they left the dungeon, or is it only good while they are exploring the dungeon? For example, a room filled with thousands of gold coins, (That are actually mimics) that's only meant to provide a good scare.

Alright now, they don't choose to go through the door, and there is an artifact or something similar necessary for them to have in a later campaign.

Now you have several choices.

1. Reusable Dungeon Trick
2. Divine Message
3. The Good Ole Intuition/Insight Trick (Not Preferred Method)
4. Rumors

**Reusable Dungeon Trick:**

What I mean by this is pretty simple. Let them go off on their adventure for a while, maybe a month or so in game. Then when talking to one of their allies, they realize that they left something behind in the dungeon.

When they head back, the Dungeon has been taken over by new monsters, use this as a chance to try out some new monsters. Maybe it's haunted by the ghosts of the monsters they brutally slaughtered their way through? Maybe a Dragon decided to make its layer their for the lols. Maybe there is a Lich there, who resurrected all of the dead corpses of the monsters.

I prefer this option, as this lets you build on your creativity and knowledge as a DM to make an entirely new encounter.

**Divine Message:**

During their sleep, they all receive messages from their various Gods, and one of them tells them that they left something important behind.

It's basically like the DM patting them on the back saying, I love you, but you're stupid and made a mistake, go back there now and get that item.

Usually my third preferred choice.

**Intuition/Insight**

You can have them roll insight, and let them figure it out that way, or you can just use that whole intuition trick.

*Your intuition tells you something valuable is behind that wall over there...*

This is usually my last resort, and I use it if all other methods have failed.

Insight is nice and all, but while it does ensure that the thing you wanted to happen happens, it does limit your creativity on the encounter.

**Rumors:**

""Hey did you hear that rumor that a group of adventures managed to clear XXXXXXXX?""

""Yeah, guess now they have that artifact that XXXXX was guarding.""

""Lucky""

I like this method, just because its funny to watch the player's faces pale as they realize they left something important behind, and someone else might have taken it first. You can also use this as a way to create an encounter with another adventurer group that took the artifact and give them some choices, like stealing the artifact, buying it, or killing them all murderhobo style.

While browsing the illustrious forum going on in r/DnDBehindTheScreen, I read one of the best and entertaining resources in at least a couple months. It was a post by u/Curtainer, link here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9z3p1l/volos\_guide\_to\_monsters\_adventure\_hooks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9z3p1l/volos_guide_to_monsters_adventure_hooks/), in which he shared a plot hook writing challenge he had for himself. I too, have way to much time on my hands, and I set to work on a similar challenge with one of my favorite Dungeon Master resources in 5e to date, Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes. I’ve written 3 plot hooks/encounter ideas for each of the creatures in the Tome, many of which I feel are overlooked or considered “too specialized” for common application in our games. Like OP, I think this is a travesty and a mistake keeping us from diversifying our universes and entertaining our players with something they may have never seen before. So, without further ado, here’s some of my favorite examples from the list, full list linked at the bottom. Also, I wish OP luck with his Monster Manual, because that seems like a Tarrasque of a task (lol, Tarrasque of a task) to undertake.

\*NOTE: No demon or devil lords in here, as I feel like plot hooks for them would be entire campaigns.

### Eidolon

\-An eidolon stalks the halls of an ancient temple, which was built with the creature’s capabilities in mind. It can possess various objects in the temple, such as a large circular stone door no mortal could move, sliding plates in the floor of certain areas that give way to pit traps, and it can even switch certain rooms around like a massive slide puzzle. 

\-An Eidolon dwells dormant in a colossal construct, slumbering beneath a mountain and covered in trees and shrouded by nature. The eidolon awakens when the sword embedded in the head of the construct (Which is buried in the mountain; perhaps a BBEG mining operation unveils it). When this occurs, the Construct and the Eidolon awaken to wipe out humanity.

\-An eidolon dwells in a medusa’s lair, where it animates her past victims to guard her inner sanctum.

### Boneclaw

\-A boneclaw has been bound to a local serial killer, and villagers have been disappearing left and right only to show back up in pieces around the town.

\-A boneclaw has been bound to serve a spoiled child of a merchant lord or other wealthy businessman. He/she has kept her parents hostage and is attempting to take over their business and use it for childish pursuits.

\-A boneclaw has been bound to arguably the cruellest cat in the world. Fishermen turn up dead, their catch stolen. Farmers and their cattle have also been found dead with deep claw wounds, milk and cream taken. The elderly woman that owns the cat is none the wiser, thinking her cat is a perfect little angel.

### Maurezhi

\-A new member to a local cult, a young adult was eaten and replaced by a Maurezhi. The demon proceeded to rise through the ranks of the cult, taking charge.

\-A necromancer and a maurezhi have aligned to better serve Orcus. The Maurezhi consumes clones of a government official made by the necromancer in order to maintain its cover indefinitely.

\-A tribe of cannibals worships a maurezhi as their god and chief. They serve it offerings of prisoners they capture in the jungle so that their god may be “Clothed in Flesh once more.”

Two years isn't very long but in that time I've learned a lot as a DM, a player, and as a human being. I want to thank the Moderators for giving me this opportunity, and thank you all in advance for participating!   

**Relevant Experience**  

* My first session was a one off for some old high school friends set in the typical D&amp;D medieval fantasy setting, the game was so fun that we actually still run those characters whenever we can all get together.  

* My next DM endeavor was Co-Dungeon Master project with one of my best friends. We called it *Star Wars Episode 5e*, we relied on the very strong characters created by Lucas and Co. to create a unique role playing experience that took place in an alternate timeline of the Empire Strikes back.  

* After taking a class on the History and Culture of the Vikings, I started work on a Viking campaign setting for 4 of my friends that took the class with me, this has been my main creative project for over a year. At its height I had three distinct parties running in the same Universe, two of which had an Ash Ketchum and Gary Oak style rivalry. I ran multiple one-offs in this universe for other friends that either created or solved problems for the main parties.  

* My current project is a Space Faring adventure set in an alternate timeline of earth where humans started departing to the far reaches of our galaxy on generation ships in the late 1980's. I'm tentatively calling the setting *Black Wake*, I'd say its Hienlein meets Faster than Light(Video Game). I just ran a one-off in the universe with my high school friends (see above) to test the mechanics and it was a huge hit, they loved it!

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've all been there, looking for a way to get our BBEG or cataclysmic event into the story without feeling like we are shoehorning it into an ongoing storythread or dropping it in cold.

Sometimes a campaign will have  The One Ring, but you will be forcing players to carry it somewhere and do something with it that they might not be interested in to begin with (see Matt Colville's video on Open World vs Closed Narrative for more on that).

Sometimes you start from the back and create this intricate line of events from the ultimate villain down to the players and they jump straight off the rails.

And sometimes you start with a series of loosely connected quests, trying to figure out how to connect it all together without suddenly telling them that ""now you have a singular goal.""

Here is my advice on how to create a world that feels alive to explore, but that has a somewhat hidden, singular force that is driving everything in one way or another.

You pick a theme, an overarching theme of something that runs through everything you do.

For instance, this latest season of Critical Role has been hunger. Everything can be connected to hunger (famine of war, the monsters in early encounters, Fjord's consuming hunger and hunger for power etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Picking your theme and watching it ripple through your world

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When picking a theme, you can start trying to figure out where this thing originates from (at the highest level) and what major ripples it might cause.

Game of Thrones had the Return of Magic as the major theme that is touching in everything, we don't yet know what caused this, but there is a surge of Magic in the world that caused the white walkers to finally move south, the dragons to hatch and a lot of other places of Magic to start blooming out and setting their plans and manipulations in motion.

Once you have picked your theme, it is time to figure out why something is happening on a level 15-20 encounter scale (pick a big bad early that either fits your theme or comes with a theme), you can then just hop down the line and go ""how would this affect everything?""

For instance, either you can have something arriving, plotting, weaving spells, waking up or generally affecting the world around it, what happens with dragon migrations, kobolds and subterranean civilisations and creatures if a Tarrasque is waking up underneath a mountain? How does this ripple out and affect the surrounding world? You have now picked a massive, end-game level monster that needs no real reason to be waking up, but can have a huge effect on the game world.

Or, much like in Game of Thrones, what is going on might be on a divine level where the players cannot directly interfere. The Great Other and the Lord of Light seem to be somehow responsible for the rebirth of magic in the world and they are mustering their armies. This means that magical things and chosen ones and the white walkers and such are all afoot, all the while humans are caught in the middle, causing great unrest and civil war. The end-game enemy of Game of Thrones would be the Night King rather than The Great Other, but the theme is the return of magic, as is the event that causes the ripples

As such, you can have either something directly responsible for the end-game, or you can have something more esotheric.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Examples of running with your Theme: The Tarrasque Rises

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Tarrasque stirs in its sleep, it hasn't woken up yet, we're not starting the campaign by blowing up a mountain and pulling up the Tarrasque from underneath (although a Tarrasque walking across the landscape would most certainly affect the world in a lot of ways, but let us save that for later, right now, it has not yet woken up, but it is getting there, the oldest creatures of the mountains have taken notice**

* A pair of dragons leave the mountain range in anticipation of the awakening, this in turn causes kobold tribes to uproot and follow their deities, and we suddenly have this massive movement of creatures from the mountains into the lowlands as the dragons search for new places to roost (together or far away from one another is entirely up to you, it depends on how much you want this movement from the mountains to affect). The Kobold tribes will most certainly come into conflict with gnolls or goblins and humanoid settlements (elves, men, caravans of travelers or merchants etc.) and maybe they will start driving game away, forcing wild beasts to move or causing people to starve. Remember, this will continue to ripple through the world, the players won't wake up one day and see two dragons and a kobold army outside of their house for no reason. This is a large migration level event, and they will feel it long before they see the dragon.
* (Dragon moves - Kobolds move - Kobolds hunt and make predators move - Kobolds and predators make goblinoids move - goblinoids start raiding villages and caravans - increased flow of people to cities for protection - Increased tension in cities. And this is just dealing with the kobolds themselves, what about the dragons? What effects are they having on things?)
* All the while, a dwarf kingdom starts suffering earthquakes in the mountain range, first something small and inconsequential, maybe a tunnel collapses and the dwarves slow down their mining, diminishing the flow of metals and gemstones to cities where the players might be doing something completely different. Weapon and jewelry- prices go up.
* Eventually, dwarven towns and cities in this kingdom starts to collapse from the shaking or are swallowed up, they need help, they need food, maybe they send a messenger on a caravan, or maybe the kingdom goes quiet? Too proud to ask for help. The players could then be sent there as part of a wealthy merchant's attempts to revitalise the dying trade-route. Once there, they find themselves needing or wanting to help the dwarves, as reports come in of another city, farther into the mountain being crushed.
* Perhaps old caverns are unearthed by the earthquakes that are taking the dwarfen kingdom down, and monsters and ancient creatures spill out, or lost passages/kingdoms are found? After all, the players are in the dwarven kingdom now (dealing with the falling cities) and this might well give them more reason to stay and explore. Or perhaps a goblin or orc horde hears about the waning strength of the dwarves, and since there are no longer dragons in the mountains, they decide that now is the time to attack.

Now we have things going on in the background as well as the foreground.

As metal prices (and tools and weapons and jewelry) are going up, with people complaining about it, maybe the players complaining about it (but getting better deals on short swords they sell etc.), the players are out dealing with crime, being hired for hunts (since there's an influx of game in the immediate area, it's where the wildlife fled to), being tasked with killing man-eating beasts that have (unbeknownst to them) been forced closer to humanity and possibly investigating increased goblinoid or gnoll raids.

From there, the flow of iron might stop completely, whilst they come across signs that the goblinoids/gnolls are fleeing from something (the kobolds and dragon) as well as any other ideas you might have surrounding how a tarrasque slowly waking up might affect the world (is there a mage in a far off tower that has some sort of alarm set to go off as this starts happening? Does he need help re-sealing the beast? Are there other things or humans trying to seek it out to hasten its awakening? etc.)

Basically, as the Tarrasque slowly stirs, all of this reaches far across the land and gets our level 1 or level 2 adventurers involved in something that normally would not have happened locally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Examples of running with your theme, as well as early adventuring: Death

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What if Death is the thing? Either a lich wanting to become a god, or something nigh divine attempting to kill a god or godess of life? From this, a slow, creeping death could be spreading across everything, there are more portents, wars and duels are more lethal, sickness could spread, there is no immediate signs or hints of an apocalypse, just a general sense of \&amp;quot;bad times\&amp;quot;, all the while, something is going on, being set in motion or starting to stir.**

What happens in a city because of this? Is there perhaps a feeling of unease and nobles and guild masters and merchants all trying to buy diamonds. Not for any immediate reasons, but people are just getting a bit worried about death.

* And if the nobles are getting diamonds, they will either need heroes to get he resurrection diamonds for them from places in the wild, or maybe from a rival noble?
* Now you have players hired either by a rich, upstanding member of society to steal from his rival or find a tribe of Kobolds to track down an old, hopefully abandoned dragon's lair and see if there are any large enough diamonds in the old, half buried mound of treasure.
* Perhaps it is guarded by creatures more commonly associated with death than with dungeon crawls?
* Maybe the players are all associated with a thieves' guild and trying to steal a diamond from the temple on order of the King of Thieves?

And again, all of this isn't because people realise they need diamonds because something terrible is coming, it's all just an effect from somebody important dying and maybe people just get a bit more glum and think on death more than they usually do? Maybe there are more ravens? Perhaps the god/godess responsible for shepherding the dead is absent and her clerics are getting worried, looking for portents and can give the players some quests to follow?

You then have people outside of civilised society, like a bandit Lord, also afraid of death, perhaps he has increased his raids on caravans in order to try to get his hands on a diamond for resurrection? Because he can't go into the city to buy one, and he can't trust his men to carry hundreds or thousands of gold into the city, survive, buy the diamond and want to come back.

Meaning that you could have:

* People stealing from each other or richer people or temples in the city.
* Nobles hiring adventurers to track down a tribe of Kobolds and get into about an abandoned dragon's hoard, and then do some dungeon diving.More ravens on the trees and houses.
* Clerics of the Grave either holding extra mass or isolating their temples.
* Maybe more undead where they should not be due to temples dedicated to controlling that shutting their doors? Maybe this happens in a village where the church loses faith and the village falls apart around the quiet belltower?

After having now:

* Stolen from a temple or mansion (successful or not? Up to you)
* Tracked down kobolds, interrogated them and Dungeon crawled (maybe there wasn't a diamond pure enough here either and the Noble sends them on further quests?)

They can now start to notice or hear about other things going on in the world around them that ties back to the overall theme.

* Perhaps somebody in a bar whispers about a village slowly crumbling from zombie attacks. They need help and the church won't open the doors or ring the bell or bless the earth of the graveyard.
* Maybe there are rumours of increased bandit attacks on the roads. Maybe a caravan is looking for caravan guards to act as the plot hook? Or you can keep this as stories until later, with the bandits as background noise until the players run into a pack of them whilst on a completely different quest further down the road?
* Maybe somebody important died in another town and somebody is hosting a festival in their honour? Maybe something could happen at that festival? Maybe it's not a festival at all, but rather a rich person offering one gold to each personwho shows up at the funeral to appease his grieving mother who fears the father won't get any mourners? Big crowd there, what if something happens? Somebody shows up wanting pay but is turned away only to turn out to be a witch or wizard or maybe a group of thugs gets turned away and start a fight which eventually leads to the players defending people against a band of mercenaries to which these thugs belonged?
* Maybe somebody gets assassinated? There is a hunt and an investigation, maybe the person was dealing with drow or deep-gnomes in trying to source something lethal or life-saving from the underdark?
* Perhaps conflict starts brewing between two smaller nations or duchies after a tournament where somebody is killed in the joust or the list field? There's a whole lot of potential skirmishes, foul play (politically and on the field) as well as players taking messages between the children of the nobles, trying to calm their increasingly hostile parents?

Everything is just a bit more lethal, and every one is a bit more on edge.

This also includes the wildlife:

* starving beasts could draw closer to villages
* fields could wither and die, forcing families to move (perhaps they need help packing up their house and a full evening can be spent in this more defeated setting, getting to know the family, packing up their heirlooms, being offered a meal even if they don't have a lot of food etc)
* verdant orchards might turn poisonous because of something the players can solve?

And as the players level up and explore, you will be able to just keep building on all of this.

Not everything has to be heavy on the theme, not at all, but it all should be connected to it through some ripple effects.

* Why is a huge dire wolf stalking a trading outpost?
* Because the wildlife died.
* Why did the wildlife die?
* A poisoned stream.
* What poisoned the stream?
* Something from the core of the mountain.
* Maybe old weapons from one of the wars between gods? Something broken now oozing magic or toxic things into a large water reservoir at the heart of a former underground kingdom. Or maybe a massive, dead, water-dwelling creature? What if it was an aboleth? How does that affect the duergar and mind-flayers and oozes living in those old hallways?

Perhaps that will come back later, or the players might not ever even think to explore the forest and figure out the stream is poisoned to begin with.

But it gives you something to work with that lets you keep building and keep finding things that work with it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing Words

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's important in all of this is to simply look for the way something has a knock-on effect on something else, or to keep escalating when asking yourself ""Why?"", after all, we are setting up an escalation of events in Dungeons and Dragons (or any other RP or even a fantasy novel)

* Why is the village sick? - Because the well is poisoned
* Why was the well poisoned? - Because something died down there
* Why did something die in the well? - It turns out to be an assassinated thief clutching a necklace
* Why was he clutching a necklace? - It has a code inside of the medallion
* Why is there a code inside of the medallion? - Because it belonged to an old noble family and is the key to an arcane vault
* Why does the noble family have the key to arcane vault? - One of their ancestors was the guardian of something ancient and terrifying locked in the vault, but they have all forgotten it.
* Why have they forgotten about the vault? - It was hidden.
* Where? - Underneath the Cathedral
* Why? - The order responsible for the vault were also responsible for building the cathedral, and placing hundreds or thousands of tonnes of stone on top seemed the safest way to keep it shut.

And suddenly you have a multi-step adventure:

* Sick village needs help
* Figure out poison and cure the village
* Fish out the corpse and find the necklace
* Decode what it is and start searching for vault
* Now they might be hunted by the people who killed the thief who are also looking for the key
* Track down the noble family and find out more about what's in the vault
* Find the location of the vault
* Get into the catacombs of the cathedral and have a dungeon crawl.
* Resolve the vault story-line at the bottom of the dungeon. Perhaps it's only one of many? Perhaps they unleash something? Perhaps they manage to fuse it shut and anger the people who were trying for the key? Happy ending? Lots of places to go from here.

And this brings me to my second point in these closing words

Just because you do not want to run an open world campaign with some massive, held-together theme does not mean you can't use this method to craft quests, build villages or link character relationships together.

This entire article is, after all, about ideas and methods for you to take and apply to your own game as you see fit.

Just remember that even in a big, thematic open world adventure where it eventually leads up to something cataclysmical or huge, not everything has to be directly connected through trackable actions (the dead aboleth could well have just died on its own), but rather through the overall theme and effect said theme has on the world.

It is completely okay to have individual storylines that do not all lead to fighting the BBEG or are immediately traceable to it, as long as you are aware of how to reconnect your players to the overall story after they complete such a quest-chain.

It is part of the beauty of what makes an open world open.

And after all, it is your adventure to run.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My background: I might be somewhat newer at DM:ing than a lot of people here, not having started proper RPG's until my early twenties (I am now 29), however, I've been doing a lot of it, whilst also spending the past eight years of my life either studying writing or writing novels. I am not a perfect person when it comes to rules, luckily, I have great players helping me with that. My focus has always been (and probably will always be) on the world and stories that form within it.

If you, as a DM, wants to use any of the above scenarios, themes or plot-hooks for your world, feel free to do so, and I trust that you will make an amazing adventure out of it.",1,"How to improve or set up an open-world campaign using a theme or singular event as your starting point, or ""How I learned to avoid the shoehorn and love causality"""
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,17,419,"Over the holidays, while visiting my hometown from grad school, I was asked to DM by a number of High School friends who had either played with me before or had expressed interest in playing. I have been developing a homebrew campaign setting and decided to use the opportunity to playtest it for a 5-6 session campaign to an audience of either completely new or novice RPG players. 

For very short context regarding the setting, I decided to crib a number of prominent fantasy worlds and set up my world as being human-dominated with other races being in the minority and being actively oppressed (particularly elves and orcs). The immediate setting was a very authoritarian confederacy of nobles and fiefdoms who were using conscription to bolster diminished garrisons tasked with pushing the ""uncivilized"" boundaries of the borderlands for human settlement. This entailed a lot of non-human pogroms. 

Anyway on to why I felt like this was a pretty good hook to start a campaign.

**Easy to Set Up**

I integrated the player's backstory into the reason for their being drafted. One, a human necromancer, was drafted in exchange for clemency for his ""crimes against divinity"". Non-human's where offered some of the rights of humans for completing a tour. Generally, it wasn't very hard to integrate each person's backstory into why they found themselves in a large mustering camp.

So once the setting is established, I found that the situation lent itself to creating an engaging, organic, and relatively easy to develop a narrative. The party is essentially brought together by force and by chance, so there was no need to develop a convoluted explanation for why all these completely different and unique characters found themselves in a party together.

**Control (at least Initially)**
Surrounded by Officers giving orders, and loyal soldiers willing to injure or kill if orders are disobeyed, having the initial part of your adventure go the way you intend it is much easier. I found my players much more engaged in the universe I had built because I essentially forced them to go through a number of encounters and interactions that gave insight into the nature of the setting. I had them walk by hangings of non-humans, mandatory attendance to a religious service unique to the setting, and moments where I could actually act out my written monologues when appropriate. However, this control needs to be tempered. As I understand DnD in my time playing and DMing, players tend to want to be able to act freely and with realistic constraint. To this end, any attempts by players to essentially go AWOL should be allowed and even encouraged. Having the army hunt them as deserters is actually a good way to move things forward later on.

**Potential for Interparty Strife**

This is to taste but I find interparty strife adds quite a bit of dimension to a game.  I found that arbitrarily or intentionally giving one of the players rank over the others opened up  a level of interparty strife over being forced to do the bidding of one of the other players (I set this up as waiting for one of the players to do something that would require discipline, and then had the commanding officer give a promotion to the player who offered to agreed to hand out corporal punishment for the infraction. The ""that guy"" of the group said ""fuck you"" to the captain, and was immediately beat and sent to the infirmary, while the necromancer enjoyed a promotion). You should try to target the player most likely to abuse their power, in order to ensure other players would begin to feel animosity towards them and the Army as a whole. In my game, within 20 minutes of playing, players were plotting amongst themselves to punish their sergeant and the ""that guy"" who kept getting them in trouble for insubordination.

**Situations of Extreme Seriousness Lend to Situations of Comedy**

In my short time as a student teacher and a substitute, I've found that in situations in which the controls on behavior are the tightest, the most mundane and banal acts of semi-defiance become wildly hilarious to its witnesses and participants. In the example of my campaign, all the party laughed themselves silly, as that guy punch his captain, and then found himself with 3 crossbow bolts in the chest, dead, and then revivified at the infirmary. In another instance the players, loudly discussing how to go AWOL, found themselves confronted by their captain after receiving many reports on them walking through camp, making plans to start a fire and run away. They again found themselves in a fit of laughter after using that moment to escape by throwing firebombs (which where made after ""that guy"" Nat 20 slight of handed about 4 flasks of high proof alcohol from the infirmary), casting grease and smoke cloud, and watching the Captain and 10 soldiers play Benny Hill while they cut a hole in the tent and escape. 
Most DnD players would have thought that was just a pretty mediocre green text story, but having set up the severity and ""seriousness"" of the environment, it became much funnier and enjoyable to create and act out hijinks

**Divergent Paths**

The hook offers a pretty immediate choice as well that feels meaningful but is easy to write for. Either they stay or they go.  Both have benefits and drawbacks that should be made clear. Staying will result in their being embedded in the hegemonic force and culture of the setting, and the chance to make inroads for wealth, status and power (as well as loot from battle and other activities). The drawbacks are clear as well. I wrote on the first expedition the party goes on with the army as basically a no challenge pogrom of an orcish village, to set the stage for what kind of organization they are taking part in, since any army is very much an instrument in the violent application of political will. However, I also give them agency in how they execute given objectives. Later instances have clearly outlined objectives for the squad to do, such as capture the Elvish captain, or end the siege of a small orc encampment. How they did it was up to them.

My party chose to run almost right away, but I essentially just recycled the same encounters, but in reverse as impediments or aids to their escape.  

**Drawbacks**

As much as I enjoyed using the hook, there are some drawbacks.

* It requires enough knowledge of military ranking and organization to make it believable

* It removes agency from players almost immediately in a way that could be very frustrating  

* It can be difficult to rationalize the role of some classes within the military (A drunken master inspired monk might feel tonally out of place in the army), though this might work in your benefit for comedic effect.



I really enjoyed how differently conscription as a hook made the campaign start. Almost immediately, players had to role play quickly when being initially questioned by their CO, and had to quickly act organically to the many order being given. A lot of first-time parties have to be shoved along to get them to do anything, so this gives a pretty organic way to railroad parties that need it, and an opportunity for total agency for those who want that instead. I would recommend it as a solid hook for players or DMs bored of the starter village or dungeon, or for first-timers who need a bit of organic feeling DM direction.

 I hope at least one other person finds my write up useful or even interesting. Sorry if there is an issue with the length and the format, this is my first time posting here. Please feel free to asks any questions for setting up a conscription scenario, or anything else regarding this post.





",1,An Intriguing Hook for Campaigns in Grim(ish) settings: Conscription
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,7,215,"Dear all! A few months ago a new sub was started, called PCAcademy. The community is slowly building but we are always looking for more curious people. Together, and most of all, with great ambitions, we are trying to create an advanced player centric community, for players looking to become that little bit more at the table. 

For those of you that are still reading we would love for you to come check out r/PCAcademy for yourself to see if you would fit, and if you would want to help us make it better. In any case we would love to welcome you for a round of conversation and inspiration. We all enjoy being at a table playing our rpgs, but what we specifically want to do at PCA is improve ourselves. In doing so, we become better at all aspects of the game such as roleplaying, character creation, and party cooperation. We aim to learn, and become a role model player at any table.

We all have the basics down, so we don’t want to talk about that, we want to go further. We want to explore and discuss how we can become exceptional players, stretch the meaning of it, and find out how we can advance our games, possibly even evolve them.

Now that you know what it is we set ourselves as goals feel free to look through our [backlog of posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/PCAcademy/) and get familiar. To aid you in finding your place among us we wrote down our [goals and the guidelines](https://redd.it/abj2zo) for the community in more detail.

Have a lovely new year, we wish you the best of success in all your endeavours, but most of all we hope to see you around at r/PCAcademy. Cheers!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,19,289,"**Prophecies were written down because they'll be needed.**

They're not just there to say ""I told you so!"", but to help people deal with future troubles.

This fits in well with prophecies as quest-hooks. For example:

&gt;On the Sixteenth day of May, 9102  
&gt;  
&gt;Redward the Wizard  
&gt;  
&gt;Will summon the demon prince of undeath  
&gt;  
&gt;Unless his staff is broken

can be a pretty obvious hook that the players now have four months to stop some evil wizard from summoning Orcus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prophecies are often deliberately vague.**

*Not* because they might not come true, but in order to prevent evil-doers from figuring them out and using them to their advantage. If a famous prophecy went ""Hey, Harold Chandler! The lich Moldywart is hiding his phylactery in the girls' bathroom!"", then obviously Moldywart will hide his phylactery somewhere else.

So our above prophecy will probably be changed to something like

&gt;The red  
&gt;  
&gt;Will call him of undeath  
&gt;  
&gt;Four moons after four heroes find these words  
&gt;  
&gt;Unless they divide his weapon

&amp;#x200B;

**Prophecies aren't just plot hooks, they're great puzzles**.

As mentioned before, the prophecies need to remain unsolvable to the unworthy. The possibilities for puzzling prophecies are endless. Some part of a prophecy may be obscured, requiring logic and knowledge known only to the characters in order to solve. A prophecy can be divided into parts, with each part hidden in some dangerous location only the characters can reach (and if the BBEG gets there first? Obviously the prophet knew he would, and planted a fake bit of prophecy right there). Details needed to decode a prophecy can be found anywhere, from a carving in a crumbling temple ruin to a casual remark made by a beggar (which the prophet would know about, since he's a prophet).

Figuring out the prophecy can be a quest in its own right.

For example:

&gt;The red  
&gt;  
&gt;Will call him of undeath  
&gt;  
&gt;Four moons after four heroes find these words  
&gt;  
&gt;Unless -

... and then have them need to find the missing bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prophecies may be deliberately false**.

They just need to help get the right thing done. A prophecy can be 100% lies, just to get a villain to make a mistake, or help the right people be in the right place in the right time.

So our prophet might leave a fake prophecy, which states that

&gt;Redward the Wizard
&gt;
&gt;Shall welcome the demon prince of undeath
&gt;
&gt;While his enemies gaze in dismay
&gt;
&gt;Still clutching their useless weapons

...in order to get the villain to allow the heroes to witness his triumph, and give them the chance to stop him.

Deliberately-fake prophecies can be super-useful in cases when a prophecy is unfulfilled due to player shenanigans or bad dice rolls.

Did the Chosen One die? Let it turn out that this was just a ruse to lure the BBEG to lower his guard: The _real_ Chosen One is actually the halfling, but the villain thinks he already won!

Did the BBEG steal the Orb of Destiny from the heroes? The Orb of Destiny is actually cursed, and the heroes job was to let it fall into the BBEG's hands.

&amp;#x200B;

**There are always more prophecies**.

Include some prophecies that have nothing to do with the story. Your prophet has messages for other generations as well! This help with the immersion, but also serves as a red herring just to keep your players busy with the prophecies. Make sure not to overdo it, and let them know that not every prophecy is about them.

I honestly have no idea what the following prophecy refers to, but it sounds prophetic:

&gt;Him with the Diamond   
&gt;  
&gt;On his poor head;  
&gt;  
&gt;Her with the Flower   
&gt;  
&gt;In her angry fist;  
&gt;  
&gt;They shall keep the Dead Tree alive

&amp;#x200B;

**Have fun**.

I personally included *The Itsy Bitsy Spider* as a prophecy. I changed the words around and made it not obvious. If the players catch on, I'll just explain that the nursery rhyme is just an echo of the actual prophecy. (Incidentally, this can be a prophecy about Lolth leading the drow out of the Underdark.)

&gt;The Spider   
&gt;  
&gt;Shall rise   
&gt;  
&gt;Upon the passage of water   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;

&gt;

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,113,"# The Lost Druid

The Lost Druids come from lands that have been maliciously destroyed - forests burned to the ground, mountains ruined by mining, swamps drained, and so on. Rather than try to rebuild or move on, the Lost Druid becomes despondent and begins to brood and seeks revenge, embracing dark magicks. Lost Druids dabble in Necromancy, and much of their Druidic power becomes corrupted and twisted in the process. 

Lost Druids always feel bitter, and some lose their sanity, filled with an insatiable desire for vengeance against those who destroyed their lands. Most live solitary lives, but there are rare occasions when they will gather for a short period to achieve a common goal. 

Lost Druids are much like Avenger Druids, except their hearts and minds more eagerly embrace the dark side of divine magicks (see ""Modifications"", below), and they generally have only a single target (or targets) as the focus of their wrath. These targets are always those responsible for the destruction of their homeland, and they are hunted without mercy. 

Lost Druids, forced to roam outside their preferred territories, are not as effective in these strange biomes, and as a result, roll all Nature and Survival checks with Disadvantage while outside their preferred territories. 

Lost Druids are singular-minded, and oftentimes eschew all measures of planning, tactics, or strategy. They go hard at their chosen targets and will destroy any who stand in-between themselves and those they blame for their misery, regardless of their innocence or neutrality in the matter. Lost Druids are hammers seeking nails, and woe to any who try to oppose them in word or deed.

They will often be plagued by bad dreams of their homeland, tortured by visions of what they have lost, and many will cry out or thrash in their sleep. Some sleepwalk, and some have killed while in this fugue-state. In any case, their waking hours are haunted by memories of their loss and they are short-tempered, vicious-in-word, and unwilling to listen to reason or negotiations regarding their chosen enemies. 

Lost Druids, once they have achieved their revenge, have a choice to make - do they continue with their reign of terror, choosing new (but similar) targets, or do they lay down their anger and bitterness, and choose a new role in life. You can choose or roll for this decision, but if the Lost Druid continues to carry on with their campaign of vengeance, they are no longer Lost Druids - they are now Avenger Druids (and will lose the restrictions/benefits outlined in the ""Modifications"" section, below). If they choose to seek a new life, they must choose a new archetype, and will never again become a Lost Druid unless they are unfortunate enough to have their homeland destroyed again (in this case, the Lost Druid automatically becomes an Avenger Druid and skips the Lost Druid archetype). 

# Modifications

Hatred opens the Druid to meddlings from Dark Powers, and Lost Druids gain access to the Necromancy spell school, via a modified ""Magic Initiate"" feat, and upon reaching 6th level, gains the ability to *Animate Dead Animals* (this works as *Animate Dead* but can only be used 1/day and only on normal (real-world) creatures with 1 HD). In addition, the Druid takes the 2 cantrips that the ""Magic Initiate"" normally grants from the Wizard class. 

Lost Druids, when they wildshape, take on undead forms of predators from their favored terrain. This is usually the strongest predator of the biome, but not always. Their spells become corrupt and they cast Heal and Cure spells *in reverse* only. When casting damage spells, their spells always operate as if they were 1 level higher than their current level. 

In addition, the Lost Druid loses the ability to Reincarnate, due to their disconnection from the forces of Nature. 


# NPC Examples

* **Yusef Nack**: Once a druid of the High Mountains, Yusuf now hunts the underground chambers of the Dwarven colony that destroyed his home. Truly fearsome and now become a bedtime story to scare Dwarven children, Yusef wages a guerrilla war - collapsing tunnels, destroying mining equipment, poisoning food stocks and water resources. When his war is complete, he will renounce his vendetta and travel far from here, hoping to find a new range to call home. 

* **Elisa Greene**: Once a Guardian of a desert oasis, her home was turned into glass, literally, from a war between elder dragons. She has sworn to destroy every last dragon on the planet, and has spent many years gathering information from as many sources as she can, and murdering hatchlings and young drakes whenever possible - working her way up the food chain towards the truly powerful dragonkind. Her single-mindedness has forced her to destroy many innocents along the way, and she has shoved all that guilt down, where it feeds her rage - more victims of the dragon's indifference to humanity. 

* **Margolem Fench**: Her swamp was drained to create more farmland in an area with very little arable land. She has embraced the necromancy that her rage has fueled to the point where she is barely a Druid anymore. She spends most of her time in a wildshaped undead hawk form, and has murdered many of the workers and their families who were responsible for destroying her home. She has begged the Dark Powers for more magic, so that she can curse the land itself, and there are stirrings in the Far Realms that have begun to notice her fervent devotion. 


# Plot Hooks

* A Lost Druid has been waging a war of attrition on a human settlement that dared to raze a forest to make room for their habitation. The villagers are in a panic and believe the area to be haunted. They have sent out word that a reward is waiting for anyone to free them from this menace.

* The party receives a message from an old Druid ally that their mountain home has been poisoned by Duergar miners, who have allowed a radioactive metal to leech into the mountain's underground springs. The wildlife has all died and the plantlife is nearly extinct. The ally begs the party for help, and says that they are biding their time in a nearby swamp. 

* A Lost Druid has fulfilled their vendetta, and has chosen to remain as an Avenger Druid, but refuses to give up the necromantic knowledge obtained in the process. The Druid has found a Necromancer mentor and will soon be a powerful multi-classed villain, hellbent on wiping out a huge colony of elves that turned the Lost Druid's former home of grasslands into a magical forest.  

*  A Lost Druid of the forest, now razed by Minoi (Tinker Gnomes) has sabotaged the Minoi's operations, turning their constructs against them, and now dozens of these ""rogue clank"" are in the wild, indiscriminately hurting and destroying those that they come into contact with, as without proper controls in place, the constructs follow their prime directive - to convert all life into energy to be stored (and returned to the Minoi's labs). The Lost Druid will remain in the area until the Minoi are all destroyed. 

* A Lost Druid of a freshwater lake, now destroyed by large-scale terraforming and allowed to become saltwater, has laid the area with hundreds of booby-traps, designed to mangle and kill. The Druid's rage is such that they will mock and taunt all who have been caught in the deadly traps and frees some of them to take back to the Dwarven terraformers as a warning.   

* A Lost Druid of the Underdark has been forced to the surface after a Drow weapon scoured a huge section of the underworld clean - razed of all life and all sources of food and water, the area is now a silent, barren tangle of tunnels and chambers. The Lost Druid is distraught and howls with rage every evening, lamenting their former home. Locals believe that the forest where the cavern entrance was found is now home to some savage beast and they have let these fears ride on the tongues of merchants, who have spread the story far and wide.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,24,66,"#Character Alignment Part 2: [Ethics and Morality](https://imgur.com/a/vkw2pdu)

&gt;“If you’re going to be crazy, you have to make sure you’re getting paid for it or else they’ll lock you up.”

— Hunter S. Thompson

In Part 1, I briefly said that “the idea is that the axis of Good versus Evil is ‘morals,’ whereas the axis of Law versus Chaos is ‘ethics.’” I’m going to expand on this much more, because those are tricky words. Oftentimes, we’re able to operate in daily life without actually having very precise definitions for all the words we use. We can usually understand each other well enough to get by. But now and then, the finer points of denotation can be important. What is the difference between Ethics and Morality? Let’s start here, with Wikipedia’s definitions. I think you’ll see rather quickly what the problem is going to be.

&gt;“**Ethics** or **moral philosophy** is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct … As a branch of philosophy, ethics investigates the questions ‘What is the best way for people to live?’ and ‘What actions are right or wrong in particular circumstances?’ In practice, ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality, by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime.”

&gt;“**Morality** (from the Latin *moralis* ‘manner, character, proper behavior’) is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper. Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion, or culture, or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with ‘goodness’ or ‘rightness’.”

I’m sure you can see for yourself that these two descriptions almost completely overlap. This is acknowledged on both Wikipedia articles, as it notes that people often use the two words interchangeably anyway. Historically, many attempts to further refine the definition of each word 1) never catch on, and 2) often include the opposite word as a sub-category. If you Google “ethics versus morality” you’ll get a million different results all offering different, basically arbitrary answers. So if you read these words being used in writings on philosophy, don’t get caught up on being familiar with the differences between them. If the author is setting out their own definition for them, follow the author’s definition for the duration of that piece so you can keep up with their line of thinking, but discard it after that. There’s just no consensus.

Except, I believe, in recent times, where a more agreed upon distinction *is* emerging. My advice still stands: when I define ethics and morality in this article, you need only adhere to it for the duration of this series. But I will try to argue that, I think, this definition is the best at describing how these words are most *commonly* used. Of all attempts I’ve seen to describe the modern distinction, I think the D&amp;D alignment system hits closest to the mark. I know it sounds kind of weird that a nerdy board game would contain any kind of philosophical truth, but to me that justifies all the debate about it. This is one of the most valuable things to ever come out of D&amp;D, and it can steer all of nerd culture (so-called “genre fiction” or “low art”) into a more philosophical and meaningfully-oriented direction. 

In Dungeons and Dragons, ethics is *assumed* to describe an adherence to an artificially defined system of rules. Thus, what is ethical and what is unethical depends upon the context of the system within which something is being analyzed. A crime in Country A might be perfectly legal in Country B, so their ethical systems are different. Ethics are subjective to context, and an ethical system is often called a “code”. Even though it is supposed to be independent of questions of “right versus wrong,” it is easy to equate real-world labels of “ethically upright” or “ethically bankrupt” actions as corresponding to Lawful and Chaotic, respectively. This of course presupposes that being Lawful is preferable, but a Chaotic character would argue that Chaos is better. They value freedom and agency over restriction and arbitration. A Lawful character’s argument is that an organized system can be more efficient and fair. If there truly is an objective way to define this spectrum, it would be as a measure of order against disorder. Fleshing out the planar multiverse of D&amp;D led to imagining what the “perfect Lawful and Chaotic beings” would be like, which is where we get Modrons and Slaadi. But in the universal, objective versions of Law and Chaos, neither is inherently good or evil.

Meanwhile, morality *does* relate to questions of “right versus wrong.” It is a more abstract concept than ethics, which could hypothetically be measured (for example, you can measure the amount of entropy in a system or the degree of restriction a legal authority exercises). Despite this, morality is assumed to be based on objective truths: this is reinforced in the typical worlds of a D&amp;D game, which feature a visitable Heaven and Hell, tangible gods walking the earth, and regular miracles. Thus, what is morally upright (“Good”) is universal to sentient beings, and what is morally reprehensible (“Evil”) is universally wrong. 

That seems a lot trickier, doesn’t it? Because we don’t necessarily know what the universal, cosmic moral imperative is. Much of human history has been devoted to arguing about this. What is “the Greater Good?” A lot of people who even believe in a Greater Good anchor that belief into equally contestable beliefs about the cosmological and metaphysical nature of reality, like a belief in God or Karma or sin. The convenient thing is that in D&amp;D, we can confirm that Gods are real, and thus, the cosmic moral imperative that comes from them is real, too. We can end the argument about what that imperative is. As a worldbuilder, you can just *decide*. You can just say that, “in this world, pulling out someone’s earbud is a cardinal sin that will land you 6 lifetimes in Hell.” That doesn’t mean that the world’s inhabitants themselves are aware of what the answers are, but the DM and players are.

So in vanilla D&amp;D, it is assumed that life objectively has value, that harming life is objectively wrong, and that seeking to make the lives of others easier, more enjoyable, and a richer experience is objectively Good. Acting selfishly isn’t inherently Evil, but doing so at the expense of others’ well being is. These are the true “Greater Good.” Again, these givens are not agreed upon in reality. There are bodies of thought which regard compassion and altruism as evil and selfishness as a virtue. For example, the philosophy called ""[Objectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_\(Ayn_Rand\))"" (for complicated reasons), created by author Ayn Rand, is built out of the premise that helping other people is morally wrong. It’s popular with a lot of hardcore capitalists and there’s a lot of overlap between this philosophy and economic theory, but when Rand sought to explore and apply her principles of government and economy and lifestyle to the greater metaphysical truths of the universe, she came to the conclusion that serving one’s self is the most Good thing you can do, even at others’ expense. She *did* often criticize government for oppressing people, and figures of power for benefitting at the expense of others, but her reasoning was not that “it’s wrong to oppress,” but rather “it’s wrong to oppress *me*.” For Rand, moral reality was different for every individual, because you are the only thing that allows yourself to experience the world. This is referred to as “Rational egoism.” It’s not Evil for “me” to oppress other people, but it is Evil for other people to oppress “me,” because “I” am the most important thing. And according to Rand, this is equally true for everyone. She's often accused of being a hypocrite for how she lived, but within her own framing it's weirdly consistent. When she is doing Good in the context of her own life, she is doing Evil in the context of the lives of the oppressed, and vice versa.

Kinda flips things on its head, huh? Is it really safe to just decide what the true versions of Good and Evil are in your D&amp;D world? To just make an assumption about it when, in reality, it could be so many different things? Isn't that just begging to start arguments about each player's personal philosophy? Well the assumptions of vanilla D&amp;D are based on what they believe the target audience commonly agree upon as being good and evil. Here’s a hint: Ayn Rand is really, *really* unpopular, so it’s no surprise that her philosophy wouldn’t inform the cosmic moral imperative of D&amp;D. Saying that “life is good” and “killing is bad” isn't super controversial. But I will concede that if you intend to involve alignment rather seriously in your game world, you can expect to have the burden of making some tough calls about what the “truly” Good thing is, sometimes.

So ethics is about rules and systems and morality is about what is objectively right. They overlap in some places, but there are clear contrasts. In real life, the law is often written with the intention of aligning perfectly with what is morally right (e.g. it is against the law to kill people). However, because there are hundreds of different legal systems, that necessarily means that they are not all aligning perfectly with Good, because that would make them identical. We can see even just within the United States’ legal system alone that they are often at odds. At one point, slavery (a distinctly Evil institution) was legal. Thus, to oppose or violate that law (a Chaotic action) would be the morally Good thing to do. Meanwhile, some laws are made without relevance to morals and are only meant to create order. A lot of traffic violations aren’t morally Evil, but they are illegal because it helps the system function better. Some laws or actions can be considered both Chaotic and Evil. Lying is inherently Chaotic because it disrupts the consistency of a system we’ve all agreed upon: communication. We operate assuming that people ought to be telling the truth so that we can act more efficiently. If you couldn’t trust other people when they tell you things, you’d always have to verify them for yourself. So a lie will introduce chaos into this system of order. But it can also potentially be Evil. If the lie is harmful to another person’s well being, then it was an Evil thing to do. But lies aren’t *inherently* Evil in the way that they are *inherently* Chaotic. [If you lived in Nazi Germany and were hiding a Jew](https://imgur.com/a/iawqiOo), it would be morally Good to lie about the Jew’s whereabouts for their safety, while also still Chaotic.

I do find that this one question certainly lingers for us, and will continue to be a source of disagreement in interpreting alignment. Is it possible for there to be an objective version of ethics, a true description of order against disorder? If you have two sets of laws, one with 9 commandments and the other being identical plus 1 more commandment, then the second set of laws is objectively more restrictive, and therefore, creates a more Lawful system than the first set of laws. But there are many ways to question what we usually assume is inherently orderly. For example, we think of fairness as a question of ethics. It would be unfair to cheat into a better position. But if it isn’t coming at the expense of anyone’s wellbeing, it isn’t really Evil. It’s just disrupting our system. Unfairness is Chaotic. But even a notion like fairness is still up to debate and can be defined differently in different ethical codes. An example to illustrate this is tax policy. In a democracy where everyone is supposed to be equal and also pay taxes to the state, the question arises of how high the taxes should be. Some people argue that everyone, rich or poor, should be paying the exact same amount in taxes because they all need to be treated equally. They are seeking face-value equality, as it is the most literal interpretation of the principle. But others might argue that the amount paid in taxes should be proportional to the amount of money a person has. If you have more money, you should pay more in taxes. This is an interpretation of equality that attempts to be fair to citizens by taking into account how taxes will affect their lives. This latter perception of fairness is employed in the United States legal system, but you can see how they both have validity. Some people try to create a new term for one or the other interpretation in order to differentiate them (like by saying one or the other is *actually* “equity,” or something), but these aren’t in common use and likely never will be. “Equality” is just a slightly-nebulous term that we can interpret in different ways.

Like I said, I believe there is an emerging, popular distinction between Ethics and Morality in modern conversation. People, when discussing crime and dishonesty in business practices, almost exclusively refer to it as “ethics.” They say that publishing false data in exchange for funding and tenure is an ethical violation, not a moral one. Or that nepotism is unethical, but they almost never call it immoral. These align perfectly with our definition of “ethics = Law and Chaos” and “morality = Good and Evil”. People will argue that consuming the art or products of bad people is immoral because you are vicariously helping that bad person contribute to evil. But they say that when the industry Powers That Be hide, deny, or obscure the sins of bad people, that’s an *unethical* action, because it takes away people’s ability to make an informed choice. It’s immoral to use money for Evil, and it’s immoral *and* unethical to use your consumer’s money for Evil (because now you’re making them complicit in Evil deceptively). We do a lot to improve D&amp;D by drawing from real-world understandings, but in this case I think we can improve our real-world understanding by borrowing a framework from D&amp;D. This definition is relatively clean compared to the current attempts at sorting out Morality vs. Ethics.

My own definition here, robust as I think it is, will continue to be interrogated in this series as we find ways of breaking it down. We’re *really* going to challenge them in Part 7, where things gets weird. However, I think you’ll find that we can continue to reconcile them, and we’ll start by discussing the “ideal” interpretations of these concepts in [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/afls08/character_alignment_part_3_archetypes_and_the/?).",1,Character Alignment Part 2: Ethics and Morality
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,24,524,"Hi r/DnDBehindTheScreen! So my players are about to head into a dungeon that's run by a gang of magically modified basilisks. With that in mind I've written out a series of petrify-themed encounters that you can use in conjuction with your basilisks/medusae/etc. for your edification. Enjoy!

**N.B.**: My list (and world) are predicated on the fact that the basilisks can un-petrify creatures later, to feed on them. Some can also animate and control petrified creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Small Animals:** *These tiny animals - hedgehogs, squirrels, birds and the like - are so startlingly lifelike that no mortal craftsmanship could compare.*

Players can recover d4 of these to sell back in town, for anything between 5gp and 25gp. This number represents not how many they find, but also how many survive the trip back intact.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Herd Animals:** *Realistic in the extreme, you can see every line and hair on the pelts of this herd of deer. Their lines of motion are incredibly sophisticated, and on closer inspection some even have blemishes and old wounds carved upon them.*

Not only are these deer a good indicator as to what might await the players, you can use them as a Chekhov's gun. Put them at the exit of a gorge, then when your enemy feels threatened have them animate the herd. Terrified and desperate to escape, these (potentially stone) deer stampede towards your players... bonus points if you change them to wildebeest instead.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Bear:** *Great and noble, this bear stands half again as tall as the tallest amongst you. There are spidery cracks across his haunches, and nauseatingly realistic wounds in its hide.*

Give an indication that the basilisks can unfreeze their enemies; if a player gets petrified they'll want to know this, and even if not the idea of a creature being part-awakened just to have chunks bitten out of them is nightmare fuel.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Giant Spider:** *A behemoth of incredible size, this spider has been made the impromptu centre of a drow outpost. The dark-skinned elves periodically touch a hand to its bulk as they pass, whispering prayers for protection and strength.*

An interesting image, clever players might be able to sneak in and cast *greater restoration* on this monster - which will subsequently attack the dark elves.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Tomb Robber:** *This statue is as eerily lifelike as the others. It depicts a woman in the act of running - a beautiful elf with tight-fitting leather armour and a mouth frozen in a rictus of terror. In one hand she clutches a rough stone idol carved in \[insert shape here\].*

This is a treasure hunter from some as-yet-unspecified era. The idol might strike the players as potentially valuable, and if they unfreeze her she will be grateful enough (or not?) to lead them to a cache of valuable, magical treasures.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Hunting Party:** *With snickering grins frozen on their ugly faces, these goblins are almost comically engaged in the clear act of skulking. Each bears a long spear, a net, and a splintered shortbow.*

Basilisks don't target solely good creatures, after all.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Sage:** *His mouth partly open and his eyes wide, a straggly beard adorns this man's face and he holds several weathered books before him. You find difficulty understanding why someone would take such great care and effort to carve such an ugly statue, in such an unflattering pose.*

This one I wouldn't put in the basilisk lair; it was recovered from the lair some time ago and is kept in a nobleman's mansion as a curio. When they explore the basilisk lair looking for some long-ago sage, they discover something that causes them to remember this guy (a portrait?), and now they have to purchase the statue from the noble. Your princess is in another castle, Mario!

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Bearer of the Battle Standard:** *With his face in a furious cry of rage and defiance, the man's armour is rent with a dozen sword strokes and what looks like... bite marks? Nevertheless the stone banner he holds is unquestionably what you seek.*

Banner not necessary of course. What's essential about this one is that he holds something your players want (a magic item? A pouch of diamonds? Information?) but he's also grievously wounded. If you're feeling sadistic have him already cut in half, so that recovering the item means seeing something truly disgusting. If not make the wounds *under* his armour, and when he comes back to life your players only have a brief time to react and heal the damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Evil Overlord:** *Despite being bound in stone, you can feel the rage and hatred coming off this commanding figure in waves. His eyes blaze from below his shaved scalp, his left fist clenched commandingly as he grips a hooked sickle in his right.*

Similar to the above. Where the former is a wounded (potential) ally, however, the one holding this artifact is a deadly enemy. Un-petrifying him just to get his item could provoke a combat encounter, yes, or you could be freeing a vampire that simply has to turn into mist to escape you, and become a threat far greater than the one your currently engaged against.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Troll Limbs:** *Long, misshapen, and covered in stone hairs both thick and coarse, this disgustingly detailed arm grips a trailing vine - and ends with a ragged wound.*

The way I'm using this one is that a troll used to live in the basilisk lair, and now helps the players in dealing with them. These show that when the basilisks began turning him to stone he would rip his own limbs off to escape the effect; the detached limb would turn to stone while the original one would regenerate. This one has a number of plot holes but c'mon, Rule of Cool - most players aren't going to complain.

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Manticore:** *Predatory and with a snickering grin on its eerily human face, the powerful haunches of this monstrous beast seem poised to leap into action.*

I include this one because one of my party's earliest BBEGs was a Manticore with her own pride that hunted across the region. Its a nice little callback showing that the homebrew world is living and breathing - you can use something else to indicate the same, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

**12. Animate Ghost:** *The statue before you is so weathered and cracked that you can barely make out its features; one limb is broken off. Floating before it is a tiny mote of bright, steady blue light. As you approach it begins to bob up and down, agitated.*

You could put the will 'o wisp statblock on this if you really wanted to. Its the ghost of the petrified victim, whose body has become so degraded with time and the elements that it is technically 'dead' - but unable to move on. Players can lay it to rest in numerous fashions if you so choose, or it could prove useful for **#13.**

&amp;#x200B;

**13. Walking Statues:** *You hear a hideous, grating hiss from the ceiling above you. With a grinding \*bang\* the heads of nearby statues turn to face you, their features unmoving. There's a pregnant pause... before they begin charging at speed.*

Your classic combat encounter. I've put in some stats for these constructs at the end of this article. This can be fun, as players quickly realise that the longer they fight the more constructs join the fray; the statues are slow though, it won't take long before your party realises killing the basilisks is the way to go.

If you utilise **#12** I'm playing it that the ghost rolls initiative and can then attempt to immobilise or control her own statue; if that statue is destroyed she can do the same to another.

&amp;#x200B;

**14. Stone Shape:** *Far from the other petrified victims you have seen, these monsters are visions from a surreal nightmare. Tentacles emerge where heads and arms should be, muscles bulge unnaturally, and there are several areas with rows of teeth that should be anatomically impossible. From above, the crazed features of Salbadin the Hearthfriend stare down at you - and begin to cackle horribly.*

Your friendly neighbourhood mage has gotten ahold of some petrified soldiers, and his basilisk ally is happy to assist. The mage uses *stone shape* to twist them into new (more powerful) forms and can also use the spell to heal them because IT MAKES SENSE OK, while the basilisk animates the statues as weapons. In addition, feel free to use the statues as bombs; if they sit on a rooftop, the battle's opening salvo could be the party being dive-bombed by falling statuary.

&amp;#x200B;

**15. Impossible Fight:** *In the vast open chamber, at its centre, stands a sorrowful sight: the heart-breaking remnants of Arithandoraxx make a beautiful statue. Her graceful, swanlike neck, her steady gaze, her billowing wings... all frozen from shimmering gold to dull stone. As you set foot within, those great limbs begin to shudder. And you begin to know why all the local monsters feared Ari...*

The PCs come up against a foe that they don't want to (or cannot) defeat. In this example Ari is an Ancient Gold Dragon, and despite the modifications necessary to reflect her statue status she's still a deadly threat. Not to mention, the PCs know and love this NPC, and don't *want* to kill her.

&amp;#x200B;

**16. The New PC:** *The goblins, the half-eaten boar, the swooping hawk frozen in stone - one such statue catches your eye. Before you stands an imposing, impressive figure, a dragonborn garbed in... 'Actually Claire would you like to describe this?'*

New Character special. This is the perfect opportunity to introduce a replacement for a fallen ally, and as a bonus you can give them insight into your party's current foe (or even hidden chambers/treasure in the lair).

&amp;#x200B;

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,73,"I got the idea in my head that legendary weapons should probably be written about. Extensively. So I'm back after, like, a year, with the manual for the Fiendslayer, a greatsword created with quite an obvious purpose, but in the most sinister way imaginable.

**Fiendslayer Manual**

*Mundane book, legendary*

&amp;#x200B;

This is a heavy tome with black leather covers and red leather binding. When closed, it is about a foot wide, 20 inches long, and 2 inches thick. It exhaustively details a greatsword named the Fiendslayer, and is written in such a way that out of its twenty chapters, it takes until Chapter II to actually know what exactly it is. The book goes over every possible dimension of the blade and its features: it is the only weapon known that can permanently kill a fiend, demon, or devil regardless of the plane they exist on, it can detect evil and good, and it is semi-sentient.

&amp;#x200B;

The blade's features include the following:

	1. This is a +2 greatsword that, on hit, does an additional 2d6 radiant damage. If the target is a fiend or tiefling, it takes 3d6 radiant damage instead.

	2. As an action, you may cast the spell detect evil and good at will, as long as you have one hand on the sword. You need not remove it from its sheath to perform this action.

	3. The blade is semi-sentient, and has no control over its own actions. If, while in melee range, it is pointed by its wielder at an evil-aligned creature, or any fiend or tiefling, the blade will automatically make an attack against that creature, using its wielder's action to do so. Pointing the blade upwards rather than at an opponent will prevent the sword from acting on its own.

	4. A fiend or tiefling wielding this sword must make a DC17 Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns or take 3d6 radiant damage.

&amp;#x200B;

The blade has a few basic rules for its function, written in several languages, including Common.

**TO YOU, WHO DARES TO WIELD THIS LEGENDARY BLADE OF JUSTICE, FOLLOW THESE RULES OR RISK DEATH BY THE BLADE ITSELF.**

	**1. Never point the blade at yourself, or your cherished ones. The sword, while not truly alive, can sense hatred, animosity, and evil, as well as all things good. When the blade is out of its sheath, it can act on its own when pointed directly at an evil creature. This blade was created to banish evil from the world itself, and will do so nearly on its own. It simply needs a wielder.**

	**2. When not in use, the blade must absolutely be kept in its sheath. This is not a tool of power, for you to walk around and scare peasants with. Such an act is childish, and you will have your privileges revoked.**

	**3. Wield the sword in both hands. This will help you better control its impulses.**

	**4. When you must clean or sharpen the sword, plant the tip firmly in the dirt, further secure it with your boot against the blade, and do your work.**

	**5. This blade is the property of the Sect. Only a Sect Penitent, Absolver, Reclaimer, or Blackhand may use this weapon, by order of High Master Black Lotus. If you have an issue with this order, you may take it up with him directly.**

	**6. Present it not the likeness or image of a devil, for the weapon may scream into the mind of the wielder until such likeness is removed or destroyed. The High Master would prefer the latter be performed, when possible.**

\[These next two rules are scrawled in the margin of the pages.\]

	**7. While immune to its effects after its lengthy forging process, fire seems to irritate the weapon, perhaps due to the connection with the Hells. It has been known to nick or jab its wielder if placed into fire. Conversely, ice seems to make it burble as a babe into the wielder's mind. This behaviour has not yet been possible to remedy.**

	**8. Imperative: Do not sleep with the blade sheathed under one's pillow. Several of our order have yet to recover from the dreams they were granted, presumably by the blade. Keep it stowed away from one's bed, and never unsheathed, during sleeping hours.**

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, the book has about ten pages of empty space for lists of names, though only six of these slots are filled. They are all written in the same style of blocky handwriting.

&amp;#x200B;

	1. High Master Black Lotus of Jakkau

	2. Penitent Bayezid of Rajdal

	3. Penitent Miriam of Gunpak

	4. Sergeant Osman the Hairy

	5. High Knight Kalrus the Observant

	6. Squire Selin the Unwise

&amp;#x200B;

The blade was forged through the genocide of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of tieflings and fiends, putting every inch of malice and hatred of the forger directly into the blade itself and reversing it to effectively make it the single most suitable weapon against devils.

&amp;#x200B;

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,36,855,"The bird(s) is(are) evil: 

We're not talking about that one time a bird shat on your car, we're talking downright evil.  

1. The birds ate something they weren't supposed to. An ancient, frozen forest was burned down by a wizard many centuries ago to fuel his war, and the souls of the trees died in anguish. The blood grass that now covers the area is infused with their torment. As human expansion forces the birds north, they now feed on anger and hate. Black clouds cover the skies as they move south for the winter, with blood in their eyes. 

2. A flock of birds was captured in a necromantic experiment, infusing the broken fragments of the wizard's soul into the raven by accident. Kept alive long after death, their skeletal bodies now fight amongst themselves and reassemble into a monstrous skeletal Roc. Each ones moves as an individual, and attacking the roc splits off more bones which fall apart. The beast terrorizes the southern islands, and to rid the world of its evil, the party must somehow reunite the soul fragments of the ancient wizard. 

3. The hyper-intelligent wizard's raven, bred for centuries by vampires in the dark, are used as the scouting force for an underground army. In order to stop the attack, every bird must be tracked down and killed before they return to their masters. 

4. The birds are vulture chimeras, torn between their human and animal instincts. They travel in packs to hunt the carrion of the land, but with the influx of hyenas from the desert lands of the west, they can't find enough food. Looks like it's time to make some. 

The bird(s) is(are) pretty much neutral:

5. The birds are giant flightless dinosaurs that have been pushed back into the tropical ruins from which they came. As the trilogog factions retake the ruins, they become attacked more and more often by the birds. 

6. The magical, round shield the fighter recently picked up? Well, it's actually the cracked egg of a cloud-maker, a large elemental bird which now thinks the fighter is its baby. 

7. The bird is totally chill on its own, except that its being controlled by the god of chaos and trickery. 

8. The birds are driven insane by the local music festival. When the bards roll into town, the birds start picking out their eyes. 

The bird(s) is(are) actually good, but you don't know it because you don't speak bird.

9. The bird is trying to stop you from going through the dangerous tunnel by picking you up and moving you backwards because it overheard you talking last night and thinks you're a cool guy. 

10. The birds are chasing you, trying to lead you to a magical unicorn which injured in the forest and needs your help.

11. The birds are controlled by the druids, testing your strength, cunning, and virtue to see if you are worth of meeting them. 

12. The bird was cursed to live forever after by an evil witch after it chased her baby down a well. But in order not to live in excruciating pain, it has to feed on human flesh. Don't worry, it only wants a little. And you have some much! Sharing is caring, right?

There’s many ways to get inspired to write. It can be an idea for a setting, a cool scene that you have in mind or just wanting to try out a new mechanic. I personally get inspired by interesting villains. So this is where we will start.

Create a NPC that will be the primary antagonist of your story. Help yourself a little by answering these questions. *For an example, I added some simple sample answers.* You do not have to adhere strictly and only to these questions, feel free to add more if you want to.

---

- What type of creature is your antagonist? (*A typical &amp; cliché example is an old Wizard.*)

- What makes them the antagonist of this story, what evil (or questionable) thing are they doing? (*The Wizard might be sucking the life out of those around him.*)

- Why are they doing those things? What do they have to gain? (*The Wizard might need the life force to revive a deceased child of theirs.*)

- Is the fact that they are an antagonist known? (*The Wizard's powers might have been previously unknown.*)

- Where can they be found? (*I'd say this Wizard lives in a poor, possibly diseased part of a city, which might be part of the reason their child is deceased.*)

- What are their stats? Feel free to create your own or use an existing stat block from the Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Mordekainen's Tome of Foes or elsewhere.

- What is their personality like? (*Our Wizard might have good intentions but sees no other solution. This conflict might make them stressed and easily irritated.*)

- What aspect of the protagonist will this antagonist challenge? (*This Wizard might put the protagonists in a position where they must weigh the value of different peoples lives to put them in the same position the wizard is currently in.*)

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,47,"**Hi!**

Im a new DM and a new Reddit user, and today I want to share with you a one shot I made (this is the second one shot I ever made) for christmas, that is meant to be played with kids. I ran the game with my two sisters and my cousin (ages 8,10 and 14) that are pretty new to d&amp;d. Its meant to be shory, light hearted, filled with overpowered loot and be as much fun as possible without investing too much in a big political story.

**\*Disclaimers-** English is not my native language, so I will probably make mistakes. Also, im a new DM so the adventure might not be up to standard with stuff more experienced DMs make, but I still hope you will like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Adventure premise**

the characters are sent by Santa to a toy factory- the toys in which have gone mad. They must fix matters with the princess in order to save Christmas.

**Running the one shot and my experience with it**

The adventure was designed for 3 level 1 players and was very easy due to low DCs and super powerful magic items. I wanted my players to enjoy the winter spirit and not be too stressed by combat. However, if your group is larger, or if they seek a greater challenge,  I suggest introducing larger amounts of foes or increasing the difficulty in other ways. My players had a blast playing, but I felt the adventure was too short to give all the loot a chance to shine in the hands of the players.

**Maps**

Here are the [Maps](https://imgur.com/a/uJIDuyu).

**Enemies**

The enemies in this adventure are angry toys. They are Basicly reskinned Modrons from the monster manual (page 224-226). This Table shows what monster from the manual is each enemy in this oneshot.

&amp;#x200B;

|One Shot monster|Monster Manual monster|
|:-|:-|
|**Toy Soldier**\- wielding wooden swords. They have windup Keys attached to their back.|**Monodrone**|
|**Stuffed Bear**\- colorful, large and scary.|**Duodrone**|
|**Toy Princess Marki**\- a doll made out of wood, wielding a wooden sword and throwing snowballs.|**Quadrone with 45 hit points**|

&amp;#x200B;

**Gifts!**

The factory is full with gifts ready to be unpacked. Each gift contains one of the following festive items. I ask the player who opens the gift to roll the d6 until they get a number that wasnt given to another player yet this game.

&amp;#x200B;

|d6|Gift|
|:-|:-|
|1|**Giant Cookies**\- 3 Giant cookies with an amazing smell. Each can be eaten with a bonus action to heal the character to full Health.|
|2|**Frost Powder**\- A snowman shaped bottle containing an extremely cold, blue powder, that can be applied to a weapon/ammo up to 6 times. When a weapon covered with frost powder hits, it deals an extra 4 cold damage and reduces the speed of the target to 5ft for 1 turn.|
|3|**Giant Lollipop**\- This Giant Lollipop serves as a +3 greataxe. It can be licked up to 3 times as a bonus action, each lick heals the user 3 HP but reduces this weapons bonus by -1.|
|4|**Ugly Sweater**\- A colorful, ugly sweater with a happy reindeer woven on it. It serves as a +3 light armor and makes the wearer's footsteps appear as deer hooves.|
|5|**Festive Socks**\- Those socks give the bearer advantage on initiative rolls, and can be used once a day to cast invisibility.|
|6|**Toymaker's kit**\- This kit, containing a small hammer and cogs could be used up to 3 times on the remains of a toy. If a DC12 Intelligence succseeds, the toy is rebuilt and serves you for a day, controlled by you on your turns in combat. You can change the appearance of the toy slightly when rebuilding it.|

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

Winter fills the realm. The players are sitting upstairs in their house, drinking hot chocolate and eating tasty pies around a table. Give them a chance to introduce their characters.

Afterwards, they hear an old man weeping and crying downstairs. They come to investigate and find a stout man, dressed in red and white clothes- Santa, no less, as the source of the cries. He tells the players that The Grand Toy Factory Of Princess Marki, the factory that produces all the toys for christmas, has strangely gone mad, and all the toys within it have became vicious. Santa is stressed, as this is the last day before christmas, and without the player's aid Christmas will be a disaster. If the players agree to help, he teleports them near their destination and wishes them good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

**Road to the Factory**

It snowy outside, and the players walk for 10 minutes on a crooked road, seeing decorated trees and rocks covered in a thick layer of snow along the path.

After the walk, the players find a large factory with high rooks and colorful walls that is decorated with fabrics and cogs. The words 'The Grand Toy Factory Of Marki' are written with lego on the front.

**Area 1- Factory Entry**

stationed near the open doors to the factory, two **Toy Soldiers** are stationed, waiting to attack characters who come close to the entry.

**Area 2- Military Hall**

This large hall has plastic medals and stars adorning its walls, and the sound of ""1..2..3.."" being shouted can be heard within it. 6 Large brass windup keys are attached to its walls.

Four **Toy Soldiers** are marching in this room in stright lines. Once they hit the wall, they turn around and march in the other direction. They march according to the rythm of the music playing in the room. They attack any character which crosses their marching path, no matter the direction the soldiers are facing.

* **Soundbox-** This soundbox is located in the bottom left corner of the room and emits sounds of ""1..2..3.."" in an assertive voice repeatedly. The soundbox gives the Toy Soldiers in this room their power, and when it is turned off they wind down and stop, falling inactive on the ground. The soundbox can be turned off with a DC10 Intelligence check or destroyed with a weapon attack that deals bludgeoning damage, but failling the check or attacking it and not succeeding attracts the attention of all the soldiers in the room.
* **Windup Keys-** Those Windup keys can be turned. Turning the top left one opens a secret tunnel leading to area 6.

**Area 3- Sleeping Room**

This small chamber includes a **Stuffed Bear** sleeping on a rug. behind it stands a large, yellow **gift**. A character can pass the bear without waking it up with a successful DC10 Stealth check.

**Area 4- Messy Corridor**

This corridor contains a lot of buttons, plastic scraps and colorful fabrics. A player that searches the rubble and succeeds on a DC10 Investigation check finds a ***Golden Key*** among the Junk.

**Area 5- Destruction Room**

The entire floor of this room is one giant conveyor belt leaing right. at the end of the belt, a pit full of sweet candy canes sharpened like spikes stand.

If a player falls off the conveyor belt into the pit, it must succeed a DC13 Dex Saving throw or take 1d6+1 Piercing damage, or half as much on a successful one. A player in the pit can climb out of it with a DC8 athletics check next turn.

Each turn the player is on the conveyor belt or attempts to cross it, they make an acrobatics check.

&amp;#x200B;

|Acrobatics check|Result|
|:-|:-|
|**0-5**|The player falls into the pit.|
|**5-10**|The player moves horizontally towards the pit in addition to its intended movement. The second time they get this result, they fall into the pit.|
|**10-18**|The player moves its intended movement.|
|**18+**|The player crossess the entire room at once.|

&amp;#x200B;

**Area 6- Snowy Corridor**

The ground of this corridor is covered in snow. Underneath it there is a pressure plate. Stepping on the pressure plate starts a voyage of snowballs to be fired from holes in the walls. Any character in the area must succeed a DC13 Dex Saving throw or take 1d6 Bludgeoning damage on a fail. If a player can see the pressure plate, it can be avoided easily (no check required).

A player searching the walls can see the holes with a DC10 Perception check and can block them.

**Area 7- Manufacturing Hall**

The smell of smoke and sounds of machinery and cogs. Toy pieces are moving on a conveyor belt to the north, as steam rollers make them into toys.

* **Stuffed Bears-** As the players enter this room, the manufacturing line just finishes building a **Stuffed Bear**. After every 2 turns of cmbat, at intiative count of 1, a new **Stuffed Bear** is created and ready to attack.
* **Steam Rollers-** Any character that starts its turn under a steam roller, takes 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage.
* **Jammed Lever-** A lever is located on the left side of the manufacturing line. It is jammed and requires a DC10 Strength check to move. On a Success, the conveyor belt stops. On a fail, the lever explodes, dealing 1d6+2 fire damage in a 10ft radius around it to any creature that fails a DC13 Dex save throw or half as much on a success. The belt then stops.

**Area 8- Gift Chamber**

Inside this small room there are two ***gifts***\- a white one and a purple one.

* **Locked Doors-** The double doors to this room are locked, and have a golden keyhole. they can be opened with the key from area 4, with a DC12 Dexterity check made with thieves tools, or with DC18 Strength check.

**Area 9- Marki's Office**

In this round room that contains pink walls, a royal chair and two ***gifts***\- yellow and pink, **Princess Marky** manages the factory.

* **Door-** Written on the pink doors of this room is '~~Merry~~ Terrible Christmas to all'. Its unlocked.
* **Princess Marki-** The Princess can be talked to and with a convincing speech and a DC18 Persuasion check can be convinced to see the joy of christmas once more. otherwise, she attacks. After she is defeated, a windup key on her be can be spinned and the princess will come back, this time as her old self, ashamed of what she did, she goes back on finishing the work on the toys just in the time for the big day tomorrow. She thanks the characters.

**Conclusion-**

If the party is able to deal with Marki, they return outside, where they see Santa with his sled and reindeers. He is extremely happy to see the characters again, and thanks them from the bottom of his heart for saving Christmas. He offers them a ride on his sled, and the one shot ends with the players moving through the night sky on top of Santa's chariot, towards a very merry christmas.

*Exhausted they finally stumble upon the remnants of a forsaken settlement; the tents long torn and destroyed and no soul in sight.*

Welcome to this encounter idea that i used last week to great effect.

**The setup involves:**

A. A hag (usually a Bheur Hag but it can easily be reflavoured. I will use the Bheur Hag in this example)  
B. A vacant settlement  
C. A relatively low level party (My players were lvl 3, it is recommended that the Hag would be a huge threat to the group if it came to a fight, especially in their exhausted state)  
D. The need for shelter and rest (the group needs a reason to stay and maybe even request help from the Hag. Running low on ressources like food or firewood helps as well)

**The Hag** herself has lost a huge parts of her memories (story reasons but you can easily insert a plague or just mental illness) and isn't aware of her nature. This leads to an interesting situation where the part of her personality that is helpful and nice towards people, which normally is just for the sake of luring them into her evil schemes, is detached from the instinct to do evil and draw pleasure from the suffering of lost wanderers.   
She retains her abilities but doesn't use most of them consciously. She may or may not subconsciously be the reason for the Blizzard though as she can control weather.

**The lair**

Once inside the Hut, the party may investigate and find a few remnants of dead hares or other animals as well as a mountain of items that she has gathered from the village over time - old toys, tools, books, etc. The village and it's suffering in this harsh land were the Hag's reason for living here and when she lost her memories over time and the villagers either left or died out ^1 she began searching for the reason she stayed here in the first place. 

Add magic items and other elements as you seem fit.

^1 (in my example the same 'plague' of amnesia befell and finally killed them as they slowly lost their drive to survive and just stopped functioning) 

**The Hag's mood - tread carefully**

As the group sits out the blizzard their behavior will fully decide how this encounter goes. Keeping the Hag both interested and relaxed is key; if identified, confronted or even attacked she can quickly turn into a deadly enemy, instinctively throwing cones of cold and other spells to protect herself. Her life is one of agony as the loneliness and conflict between her personality traits that she cannot comprehend have been festering for many years. Betrayal by the first visitors she had in a long time will be painful and as DM, don't be afraid to let her openly show her feelings. My group decided to secretly leave her behind at some point and the agonized wailing that followed them will haunt their dreams for many nights.

**Waiting for the storm to pass over**

As they rest, the very curious Hag will remain sleepless and watch them in their sleep. The players, especially those who inevitable stand guard while the others sleep, have many ways to interact with her and she will gladly initiate conversation. She will get excited by having the adventurers explain toys or tools to her, she will ask for how they got lost and ask increasingly personal questions about misery and tragedy in the character's lives. Occasionally she will salivate from the tales (as the suffering of mortals is the Hag's pleasure) but then confused about her own feelings wipe away the drool.

After 1-2 nights or when the storm has passed (as i mentioned above, her mood could influence the weather unbeknownst to her) she may offer the adventurers to guide them to the next settlement or road of their choosing (not that she would know where those lie), referring to her skill in navigating the fickle terrain that the group has witnessed the day before.

If they accept, she will help them...but...there is one problem...

You see, starting during the night, the Hag's stomach will start rummaging, indicating that she hasn't eaten in quite a while. And for good reason, as she is aware that the Maddening Feast ability of a Bheur Hag is something that will terrify her guests and it's an aspect of her nature that she is incredibly ashamed and powerless about. She enjoys feasting on the living bodies of critters she catches greatly, but knows that it's not something she should show to normal folk.

If sufficiently convinced she will accept the offer to eat but take her meal out of sight of the group asking them not to follow. If they inevitably do in secret, just apply the mechanics of the ability in Volo's (WIS Saving throw or frightened). As they see the Hag tear into a dying hare or fox with claws and teeth in a horrifying frenzy, they will have to decide whether to ignore it or run for the hills.

If they run, the feeling of betrayal will hurt the Hag and you can either decide to let her chase them or stay behind.

In any case, as they part ways and hear her wailing in the distance the player's messiah complex will leave them thinking: Did they do the right thing? Should they try to save her? Will she revert one day and start killing wanderers? Should they have killed her? (works especially well in an all-good alignment party).

**Aftermath**

You can treat this as a one-time encounter or expand from it. Maybe one day the players will have to return to this place for a quest? Who knows what they will find, a mad scorned woman, a true evil Hag or a sad soul who's mind has deteriorated even further?

Maybe they will require allies at some point and with no where to go they could decide to recruit her, a dangerous weapon to unleash the power of ice and despair upon their enemies?

My players loved this encounter and i'm not done with it, one of the players seems determined to further research Hags and one day return to make things right after they abandoned her.",1,The Bheur Hag with Amnesia - when common sense is your player's greatest enemy
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,37,"All joking aside, politics and crime have always been closely intertwined. Politics, especially in regards to a fantasy setting, is a difficult agenda to tackle. Not all of this will be applicable for your setting, and that’s okay. This is meant to get your juices flowing and work on the beginning of a system in your fantasy world that helps you deal with the one thing all PCs get into eventually: crime.



**Overview**

Before the party can get into trouble and be charged with a crime, there has to be a crime to charge them with. Unless your adventuring somewhere that does not have a governing body, there will be laws on the books. The extent and reach of these laws are limitless, much like today, and will cover a wide variety of topics. Unless your party is deeply entrenched and intrigued with political savoir-faire, own lots of land or business, or has made the local liege their enemy, they probably won’t care too much about a 3,000 page intricate tax law published by Iodotes, the Chancellor to the King.

In fact, the laws that affect the party are going to be normally more tangible; we all know the party is a bunch of murderhobos. Before we can look at the process of enforcing laws, we need to figure out how they are created in the first place. Even more important than that, we must examine why they are created.

___________________________________________________________________________________________
**The Governing Body**

Depending on the scope of your adventure into crime, your governing body may be small as a local mayor, serving under a lord. It may be the lord himself. It may go all the way to the highest echelons of power and rest at the feet of the king. It may also be controlled by a group of adventure capitalists in a purely economically controlled merchant empire.

Your governing body may be one, a mixture of all, or none of the above. Because this is about legislature only, I will not be discussing any corrections, law enforcement or judiciary actions.

*Autocracy/Dictatorship/Monarch* – this style of rule has the ruler in near absolute power. Sometimes treated as a god, their word is final.

*Feudalism* – in a feudalistic society, a lord presides over a set geographic or political area. Sometimes the lord is under the thumb of a monarch, but not necessarily. The lord provides protection and stability in exchange for their peasants or citizens providing food and/or soldiers when the lord calls. In regard to a Criminal Justice system, their word is essentially law in their domain only. Lords typically have 2-3 advisors in their council.

*Democracy* - everybody in the society gets a say so in what laws get passed


*Republic* - differs slightly from a democracy. In a republic, every member of society is allotted a vote to place a representative into the legislature. This representative then votes on laws in place of the average citizen.

*Plutocracy* - a government ran by merchant.

*Theocracy* - government run by religious leaders.

This is going to be your regular forms of government, although other certainly exist such as militocracy, a magocracy, a confederacy, or a plutocracy. All of these are viable forms of government, but they may fit the theme of some of the previously mentioned government types.

This block is incredibly important because it not only determines the kind of government your kingdom/city/country will have, it also can help you to determine what values the lawmakers of your society deem important. A desert country will hold laws regarding the consumption of water much higher than a plains kingdom will. An honor bound country of orcish warriors will care more about their weapon not being peace bound than a magocracy will. After all, not every race/government combo will have the same values.

Before we can continue, you need to decide what kind of crimes your Criminal Justice system will be concerned about. Generally speaking, crime in the US is broken up into two categories - personal crime and property crime. Property crime deals with cars, homes, building, arson, bribery, embezzlement, etc. Personal crime deals with actual assaults on a person - assault, battery, murder, rape, kidnapping. [This website](http://www.nyccriminallawyers.com/personal-crimes-vs-property-crimes/) has many more examples.

Of course, each charge has varying degrees of severity - first, second, third, voluntary, involuntary - and I won’t bore you with the details; unless you plan on making a very detailed Criminal Justice system in your world, you probably won’t need it.

Consider this: arson used to be punishable by death. Why? Most buildings were some kind of wood and burned very easily. The fire would spread, resulting in inexplicable damage to a city. Just another example of how a value by today’s standards would be totally different by your fantasy standard.

I have a city in my homebrew world called Port Altonis. Port Alontis was originally a backwater, trader destination for setting off on transoceanic voyages. It was filthy, disgusting and most of all, illicit. Port Alontiswas a den of decadence, and based similarly off of mobsters and Las Vegas. Lots of gambling and lying, back door deals. When an order of paladins discovered the filth in Port Alontis they proceeded to, in the name of their god, “cleanse” the port city. After they removed what they saw as the source of the corruption, the paladins established a theocracy and introduced a new law - that no lie shall be uttered in the city of Port Alontis or the offender shall be punished by death by beheading. Whoa, brutal. Death for a lie? Well, yeah. Consider what the paladins - and the theocracy - hold dear, their values, values of their god. They cleansed an entire city and want it to remain that way.

How are magic users considered in regards to these laws that a legislature passes? If so, are only select schools of magic considered? Is necromancy legal? Is divination allowed? Both of these schools of magic can be used as evidence in a trial, ie allowing the dead to testify.  In a low magic setting, this might not be a big deal at all - or it might be the biggest deal. In a low magic setting, 95% of common people will never see magic or a magic user. People tend to fear what they don’t know, so they pass laws that make no sense. Maybe a rogue wizard came through one day and, after too much drinking, a fireball flew into the tavern. That’s how magic users got banned in the village of Ravensnow. If they have to go through the town, which requires mayoral approval, their hands are to be bound and under armed escort until they leave the town.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
**The Legislative Process**

In the above section, we tried to examine some values. Desert place high value on way, governments with wooden building don't like arson, orcs don't like their weapons to be peace bound. But how does this translate to the legislative process of creating laws?

*Rule by Decree - the Monarchy*
The Monarchy is all supreme. Whether they are placed there by a divine destiny, or if they took the throne through shrewd political maneuvering or by battle, the Monarchy is here to stay. They control nearly every aspect of the kingdom through*decrees*. These *decrees* vary from *laws*. A decree is made by our Monarchy. Their world is law. While a Monarch may have advisers that help form the *decree*, there is no more debate or shaping once the *decree* is made.

The Rule by Decree allows for quick, unchallenged laws by the creation of the sole power holder. In our case, this is the Monarchy. There is not legislative governing body in this case.

Though is may seem so, Rule by Decree is not inherently evil or self serving. Good can be done by a  decree as well.

*Examples of Ruling by Decree*

1.  Raising of the Army and Navy, if no standing military is available

2. Changing of the tax rates

3. Declaration of a state of emergency

4. Trade treaties


As we see by the examples, Rule by Decree type legislature is large, overarching laws that effect the entirely of the populace. Dictatorships, autocracies, and militarocracies to a limited extend would run a similar Rule by Decree legislative process.



*The Power of the People - the Democracy*
 
Of the people, by the people. The government envisioned by so many of the scholars of the Enlightenment. Contrary to popular belief, an actual direction democracy, while it can exist, is a very difficult thing to create and maintain. In this Direct Democracy, every person gets one vote for each issue going up for vote. Naturally, this is a slow, cumbersome system better suited for small groups than large ones. With any democracy, there is also the risk of *the Tyranny of the Majority*, which puts the needs of 51% of the voters over the needs of the remaining 49%.

Within the Direct Democracy, there must be a place and time to vote. Different from laws and decrees, these issues to be voted on are referred to as *initiatives*. Direction Democracy does not necessarily have a leader as much as a figurehead in order to control the voting place, voting etiquette and voting times.

*Examples of Direct Democracy Initiatives*

1. Legalization of recreational drug usage

2. Weapon/magic restrictions

3. Referendums - the recall and elimination of previous laws/decrees/initiatives


*Senātus Populusque Rōmānus - the Republic*

Unlike the Direct Democracy, most of us live in a Republic. In this system, the population itself does not get a vote, nor does the leader of the Republic. Instead, a representative is elected into a legislative house to vote as theyr constituents would vote. Normally, there is a figurehead that leads the formal organization of voting. This figurehead is separate from the leader of the Republic.

*Examples of Republic laws*

1. Organization and funding of both the Army and Navy.

2. Creation of formal education systems - magical, clerical and military in addition to base education

3. Ratification of trade treaties

4. Appointment of figureheads to peruse specific goals - whether this be in the form of special interest groups (research into how necromancy effects the living) or a specific organization (the Adventurer's Guild)


*Fiefdom - the Lord*

On a small scale, the Lord is similar to a Monarchy. Within the realm, they are the all knowing. The Lord controls not only the local militia, they set the taxes and appoint Vassals (similar to mayors) to control the Lord's interest in his name. The Lord also has a group of advisers, referred to as Council, that assist in creating Decrees. The Lord is superseded by who he serves, whether the Monarchy, the Republic, or numerous other governmental bodies. The Lord cannot act out of line from his own liege, or he may soon find himself replaced and de-legitimatized by another.

*Examples of the Lord's Decree*

1. Set local taxes, in addition to enforcing tax collection

2. Raise an Army in service of the Monarchy

3. Collect food and other goods from those under his protection


___________________________________________________________________________________________

**In Closing**


The point of this is not only do we need to consider the laws that are created, but how and why they are created. Because if we understand why a law is created, then we understand the values of those lawmakers and governing bodies. If we understand those values, then we understand their society, their worldviews, and we understand them better as people. That makes for better, more intimate, more involved worldbuilding. And that, that makes us better DMs.
",1,Politics &amp; Crime: The Legislature
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,136,1124,"The DMG gives some loose guidelines about ""Tiers of Play:"" 1-4 are local heroes, 5-10 are heroes of the realm, 11-16 are masters of the realm, and 17-20 are masters of the world.  This is nice, but I had a more precise question I wanted the answer to: how many guys are running around the world who could do the same things as the heroes at any given level.  In other words, how rare is a level 12 character going to be? 

To approach this, I used an analogue.  In chess, players are given an ELO rank that determines their relative strength.  Simply put, win and your rating goes up, lose and your rating goes down, so the higher your rating, the stronger you are.  On Chess.com, there is a global blitz leaderboard (blitz is a chess game played with between 3 and 15 minutes of time per player), and the ratings range from 100 all the way up to 3100 (actually, Hikaru Nakamura has a rating of 3123 at the moment of writing).  The global leaderboard has a skewed distribution, with the peak at 900, but is only slightly less at 1000.  

This distribution gives us some kind of way to approach high levels of skill.  If we take the range of 1000 to 3000 in 100 point chunks, we get 21 ""levels.""  We can take 1000 to be equal to level 0, and 3000 to be level 20.  Here are the numbers: 

ELO Rating | Players  | % Players 
--- | --- | ---
1000 | 277826 | 18.6425%
1100 | 256168 | 17.1892%
1200 | 222747 | 14.9466%
1300 | 186977 | 12.5464%
1400 | 148948 | 9.9946%
1500 | 115127 | 7.7252%
1600 | 86588 | 5.8102%
1700 | 63496 | 4.2607%
1800 | 45614 | 3.0608%
1900 | 31329 | 2.1022%
2000 | 21701 | 1.4562%
2100 | 13839 | 0.9286%
2200 | 8602 | 0.5772%
2300 | 5065 | 0.3399%
2400 | 3118 | 0.2092%

2700 | 441 | 0.0296%
2800 | 209 | 0.0140%
2900 | 77 | 0.0052%
3000 | 16 | 0.0011%
3100 | 2 | 0.0001%


If we then convert this to levels and the cumulative percentage of people with such level (with 1000 being level 0 and 3000 being level 20), we get: 

Level | Cumulative % | Town of 20,000 | City of 10,000,000 | Village of 500

If we directly superimpose this on the DND world, we could say that over 35% of the folks in the world are level 0 or 1.  A player at level 5 is stronger than 75% of people in the world.  At level 10, a player would be in the 97th percentile.  By level 15, a player is in the 99.8th percentile; there are not many people around who are stronger.  

This can be utilized to tell you how many other folks of similar strength are running around your world.  Determine the population of a city, multiply the total population by the percentage at that level, and you see how many people of a level are expected to be there.  For instance, if you have a town of 20,000 people, then you might have 1 level 19 guy and 300 level 10 guys around, but 15,000 people would be level 4 or less.  If the town has 10 million people, it might have over 100 level 20 guys running around, and 150,000 level 10 guys, but 7.5 million would be below level 5.  

You can further divide this into the various classes and subclasses, use it to populate the high ranks of a monastery, military camp, or wizard school, or tell how strong you might expect a chief in a random village to be.  

-------

I would also note that on chess.com, there are quite a few players with ratings below 1000 that I did not account for in the above.  If I take the total user base of chess.com and lump the together to get the ""at least 1000"" category, then instead of 277,826 people, it is 4,157,937, increasing the relative percentage of ""level 0"" characters from 18.6% to 77.4%, and thereby reducing the other categories accordingly, as in the table below.  You can use this if you want to reduce to number of high-level people running around your world:

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,26,419,"NPC Bards in D&amp;D are, usually, little more than window dressing, playing songs in a tavern or on the street, if that. Sometimes they can reach the role of ""comic relief"". But bards can have a much larger role in your adventures because they hold in their hands the greatest resource of all.

What is the most important thing for your players? Items? Levels? No, it's reputation.

Without a good reputation, the quest-givers will not ask their help. Nobles will refuse to see them. Hidden organizations will not share their secrets with them. Inns and taverns will close their doors when they pass by. If their reputation is bad enough, they could be chased out of town by an angry mob, they could be welcomed into the forest by a hail of arrows. Clerics won't resurrect them, hunters and paladins may even chase after them. 

All of that is something that an antagonistic bard could cause. By putting bards in your story as enemies (they don't need to be evil, just have a reason to go against the party) you can put your heroes in a very difficult situation, and more importantly, one that can not be solved with violence. 

Killing the bard could work, but it's likely to just make everything worse. So here are 12 ideas to introduce bards in your campaign, divided into 3 categories.

**Note** - Not all of these require a bard to work. Many could do with any illusionist or fey. The biggest advantage of using a bard is that, being a public figure, they will have greater public support and be much harder for the players to deal with. Simply threatening them could ruin their reputation.

---
---
**The bard is evil**

The most straightforward situation: the bard is a bad person, and for one reason or another wants to ruin the player's lives. Maybe he's trying to blackmail them for money or items, saying he'll stop the rumours if they give him what he wants. Maybe he's a sadist, or he's working for some dark power.

Whatever the reason, this bard is a real bastard. 

---
**1 -** A low-level bard wants something the players have. He was spying them and saw they have an item he's been searching for a long time. He has no chance of taking them head-on, so he devises a plan: he will spread the rumour they have committed a crime, even leaving false clues and compromising objects in their room, then tip the guards and have them arrested.

He hopes to be able to rummage through their possessions after the guards have taken them away, and if that fails he'll talk to them (likely under a false identity) and convince to trade the item for their freedom. 

This works best if the players are very law-abiding and the bard can assume they won't try to fight the guards, and instead let themselves be captured in the hope of clearing the mistake. 

---
**2 -** A mid-level bard is working for an evil fey/demon/god and just wants to spread chaos and destruction. He sees the players as a force of good and wants to destroy them. He's gonna commit crimes and try to blame the players for it, planting false evidence and bribing guards. 

With his magic, he can create false sounds and images, or change his aspect to pretend to be a witness himself. Maybe he murders the innkeeper when only the PCs are in the building, or kill someone they recently interrogated. If there is a rival group of heroes, he could kill them. 

Soon the players will find themselves with the entire city guard on their trail. They may be locked up and have to escape and try to prove their innocence while they sneak around the crime scenes, or strike a deal with a noble that trusts them.

---

**3 -**  A mid-level bard is working for a local BBG. He knows the PCs are working to stop his boss, and he wants to protect him by sending them in the wrong direction.

If his master is hiding in a dungeon somewhere, he could make up an ancient legend that says he's hiding in a dungeon in the opposite direction. Soon the ""legend"" spreads, the players hear about it and think that's where they have to go next. In truth, a deadly monster lives in that other dungeon.

If his master is a public figure with a double life of crime, he could make up rumours to pin the blame on another person. Maybe he could accuse a noble, the players will break into that noble house convinced he's the villain, find nothing, and then discover someone has tipped the city guards about their escapade.

---
**4 -** A high-level bard has learned alien, demented musics from another dimension. His songs, apparently normal, carry the seed of madness and bring forth a being from beyond time and space. He's a bard of Azathoth, beating vile drums whining accursed flutes.

As violence and insanity grow in the region, so does his popularity, as the common folks are enthralled by his hypnotic (literally) tunes. 

But nobody has connected the episodes of violence and strange monsters with his music. 

The players will have to find evidence that the bard is the culprit before it's too late and the people are too far gone to be able to turn on him. Perhaps the king himself or someone close to him has taken a liking to his music and will protect their beautiful Singing God no matter what.
 
---
**How do they solve it?**

The simplest scenario to solve, the bard is evil. They have done bad things. The players can find evidence of it, show it to the police and populace and clear their name.  The bard may have traps, underlings or friends that the players will have to cut through first.  Ideal for investigative adventures.

Another option could be to threaten, trick or bribe the bard.

---
---

**The bard has a grudge against the players**

The bard isn't evil, they could even be heroes themselves. But for some reason they hate the players, and want to ruin their reputation.

Now people look at the players in a strange way, shopkeepers are very reticent or scared of them, some may be very vocal about their disappointment: ""I thought you were better than this. I thought you were good people. I'm very disappointed."" are not phrases anyone wants to hear. 

---

**1 -** The bard thinks the players are bad guys, pretending to be heroes. Perhaps a simple misunderstanding, or maybe paranoia caused by some tragic event in the bard past, every day the bard can be found in the town square singing of the players (supposed) evil deeds

. Maybe he thinks they have killed someone when in reality the players have helped that person disappear. Maybe they were working secretly for someone, and the bard doesn't know that.

This hook should be based on your own campaign: take a previous adventure the players have done that could be misunderstood for an evil act, and build on that. Make the PCs revisit a place they've already been to, looking for evidence. But now the place has been taken over by new enemies.

---

**2 -** The bard is being misled by a spirit. The ghost of a dead loved one talks with the bard, the ghost is now a twisted and evil spirit but the bard is blinded by love. And this spirit is inventing lies about the players. 

The players will have to find out the ghosts exists in the first place, then find a way to put it to rest. Maybe investigating their previous life or the causes of their death, or maybe they can just convince the bard that the spirit is just a monster now. 

Whatever happens, it will be very painful for the bard. 

-------

**3 -** The bard is a good guy, but a member of an evil group of adventurers that are taking advantage of him to ruin the reputation of their competition. 

Similar to the previous hook, but now the players have to convince the bard they are the victim, and it won't be easy. Killing the evil adventurers would only make things worst. The PCs can find evidence of their evil-ness, but the evil adventurers are ready to protect it, and they are strong. 

-----

**4 -** In a previous adventure, the players have killed someone that was very close to the bard. Now his life is full of grief and regret, and have decided to take their revenge against the players. They are making up horrible stories and lies about them, hoping to hurt them purely for the sake of it.

The players have no reliable way of solving this one, best they can do is be very apologetic and try to fix things with the bard, or in some way convince them that what they did was the only option. 

And if that wasn't the case, well, this can be a good lesson for your players to think about the long-term repercussions of their actions.

--------

**How do they solve it?**

Lost and lots of roleplaying. Strongly suggested if your players are ok with spending an entire session talking without a single dice roll. Maybe avoid this one if your players prefer to kick down doors and kill everything in sight. 

---

----

**The bard is working for someone**

The bard is an agent of someone else, think the bards in Dragon Age. Perhaps a noble hates the players, or a rival, or they are involved in some political scheme. Whatever the reason, they are just doing their job. It's nothin personnel kid. 

---

**1 -** A playwright has been paid to write a very negative play about the players, that could ruin their name with all the wealthy and nobles in the country. All the actors are famous and talented, but they don't know someone is behind this play. Even the playwright himself doesn't know, he's been given instruction by someone else, or so he says.

The players will have to investigate with the crew, the actors, the composer, and through a web of lies and half-truths find out who's behind the play.

---

**2 -** A famous bard just came out with a new spectacle, and it involves some strange elements: to an outsider, nothing seems wrong, but the players immediately notice references to things they have done, and nobody should know about. Details too precise to be a coincidence. 

It's almost as if the bard was right with them, in their last dungeon. How can that be? The players will have to find out where this bard gets his inspiration, and what else that source knows about them. 

But soon, they find themselves caught in a terrible trap.

----

**3 -** An angel dislikes the players, he thinks they're not good enough, maybe there is a shady member in their group or they have strange friends. But the players are working with some church or king, and that's just not ok. The angels believe it's all a trick by some evil force.

 The angel has sent on the material plane a group of angelic bards to every church and every court, to make sure the truth about the PCs is known. 

They are agents of evil, anyone that helps or asks their help will be shunned and cursed. If any priest talks with them, be anathema! If any noble pay them, be anathema! 

It's not long before paladins, inquisitors and witch hunters start gunning down for the players. 

And what are the players gonna do? Accuse the angels of being liars? Is there greater blasphemy than that?

-------

**4 -**  The only mistake the players made was helping a nobleman once. It was a regular quest, nothing strange. But now their name is tied to his, and so are their reputations. Enemies of the noble are attacking the players by spreading lies to ruin his reputation by proxy.  

The nobleman wants to publicly reject the players, to clean his hands from them, but that would leave the players with no allies in town. Can they find a solution before they are thrown under the metaphorical bus? 

-------

**How do they solve it?**

Talking with the bard won't do much good this time, even if they stop someone else will start. The players have to reach the root of the problem and stop whoever is paying the bard to do it in the first place. It could be the start of a larger adventure, a way to introduce your BBG or just to get the players in the direction of their next adventure.

---

----

**What if The players actually deserve it?** 

Maybe your players are evil, or they did something really bad, or more likely really stupid. And now their comeuppance is coming. 

Antagonistic bards are a perfect way of creating consequences without killing anyone or taking away their items. It's a more subtle punishment that fits well in the world and can be used as a new starting point after a story has derailed, or even redemption after some mistake. 

Don't see this as just a punishment, but as a way to create repercussions for their actions and build an adventure on them. Use the PC nonsense in a constructive way. 


(Soon I'll make a couple of these hooks into actual, ready-to-run adventures with stats and everything.) 

EDIT - lots of good ideas in this thread, I'll add them to the PDF

",1,Bards as antagonists - 12 ideas to use bard as central elements in your adventures
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,38,752,"I've been thinking about Divinity and Patrons in DnD. There are a few hints of things in 5e that really call out to me as a DM. Things baked into a class that allows me, as the DM, to communicate directly to the player. This is where the meat in a personal story comes from, for me.

You pick a warlock, that gives me the opportunity to talk to you, literally and metaphorically about your character, by giving me a Patron. Same with a cleric/paladin and their divinity. To a lesser extent, Wizards and their schools, druids and their circles, and there's probably a few I'm missing. 

But I've been thinking about this a lot and how to codify it in a way that lets me give each character that same treatment and attention. Because it can be easy to lose track of how to put the spotlight on a player, and when one player is naturally charismatic or has an automatically interesting backstory to explore, they can take precedence. 

So this is my first take at creating my divine formula. It will have to be editing a bit to work for Patrons or other things like it. It's as follows:

* **Name** - what is this divine being known as?
* **What they control** - what is their domain(s)?
* **Omens** - ways for the DM to allude something to the player
* **How they communicate** - ways for the DM to answer the player's questions
* **Prayers they appreciate** - things the player can do to gain favor
* **Avatars** - ways for the DM to interact directly with the player

Here's my first example. The goal is that you read this and can use it immediately. So tell me what's missing/working. 

The Cloud Eater
--
All clouds belong to her. Her breath are storms. Her grasp reaches from sky to ground through rain and lightning. Her sight extends through the upside down grey expanse. Her calm is winter, where all things die or hide. The sea is her rage, the waters fearful of her strike. 

**What they control**

Clouds, which can blot the sun, or bring the rain, or guide sailors. She is a manipulator in this way, moving the clouds to the places she wants and letting them bring what they may.

**Omens**

* Clouds shaped like hands
* Lightning striking the sea
* Snowfall outside of winter
* A giant stepping down from the clouds in your peripheral
* Birds fleeing from an unseen storm
* The sudden shift in temperature (cold front typically)

**How they communicate with you**

* Whispers carried by the wind. They make no words, but you understand through emotions.
* Static shocks, giving you an image in your mind and nothing more.
* Her, made of clouds, in the sky, pointing you in a direction
* Giant's footprint in the snow (you're close...)
* A grand storm on the horizon (means safety, but the danger is coming)
* Thunder. It forms a word in your head.

**Prayers they appreciate**

* Boiling water
* Standing in the storm, blade raised
* Coating your weapon in rainwater
* Steam baths
* Snow angels
* Baths in ice

**Avatars**

* A face in the clouds, speaking in lightning.
* A stranger in the rain. They are hot to the touch.
* Shadow of a giant, towering over the world, only seen when lightning strikes.
* Electric impulse in your body, moving your arm or leg.
* An animated lightning bolt that wants to kill you.
* A rain cloud that follows you in the sky (not entirely noticeable at first).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to write your own for the divine beings in your campaign. Try to find new ways to communicate with your player-characters. And hopefully this little formula/idea helps, or at least makes it easier for you.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,35,450,"**Dragon Magic: As It Is:**

The *optional* rule allows adult and older dragons to learn &amp; retain *a number of spells = charisma modifier*. The maximum level for these spells is the dragon's CR / 3. *Example: An adult Copper dragon gains +3 spells total  (17 cha) - at lvl 4th or lower (CR 14 / 3, round down).* I asked Stack Exchange on the type of magic a dragon uses, got a [surprisingly good answer](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/136153/what-spell-list-must-dragons-use-if-any). Cantrips are never mentioned. Obviously a dragon would *never* waste one of their precious few slots to gain one. This writeup suggests you just give them a few because, you know, dragons.

**Which Cantrips &amp; Why?**

Logically, a dragon survives with their one breath weapon - this is, quite literally, their life and breath. The metallic dragons often get a second one that does something kind of fun &amp;/or silly but the point remains the same: they have a vested interest in being good with their energy device. What's more, dragons have opportunity for practice: centuries if not eons of time. Yet, an ancient Red has the choice to either blast out 26d6 damage or... nothing. What. The. Flux. 

Given that much knowledge, focus, eyesight, magic and pure necessity this example Red dragon should be able to blow glass, solder gold chains or even light a cigar across the room. Any dragon past puberty should have, *ahem*, a certain level of control.

**Who Gets What:**
This is broken down into the ~~four~~ five (or so) energy types for your consideration. *Note:* Sum of hit dice probably counts as 'total levels' to determine cantrip damage and ability.

**Fire** - Brass, Gold &amp; Red 

- *Control Flames:* This spell implies a requirement of an already existing, separate flame. Difficult retrofit, but fun. Perhaps fire is the dragon's only true friend?

- *Fire Bolt* Excellent for when a dragon coughs, spits or yawns - or wants to give a warning shot to that tiefling rogue 

- *Produce Flame* Makes for a dragon-mouth that glows really brightly? Or spits for an irritating 4 h.p. damage? Paint me 'underwhelmed'.

- *Create Bonfire* 'The dragon spits at a massive urn and it lights up fully ablaze!' Boom, baby. This one is really great... but don't mention it is from something as mundane as a Boy Scout's 'Insta- Weiner / Marshmallow' spell.

**Acid** - Black &amp; Copper

- *Acid Splash* This is a great 'spit, cough, sneeze &amp; snort' spell.

- *Mold Earth* You can make parts of this cantrip work: 'The dragon spits on some stone and it melts into a certain shape.' Having that 5' section of loose earth jumping around makes no sense at all, however.

**Cold** - White &amp; Silver
 
- *Chill Touch* Makes the most sense if the actual dragon had a frosty touch. They don't. You could add it to a bite-nibble-lick attack perhaps? 'Dragon's tongue is cold and hurts a bit.'

- *Frostbite* &amp; *Ray of Frost* You can work either into the *spit, sneeze, cough or snort* effect. Similar concept, slightly different impact. You pick.

**Electricity** - Blue &amp; Bronze

- *Lightning Lure* This one fits poorly even if your target is wearing metallic and magnetizable armour. Not even useful as dragons can easily reach, run or fly over a typical 10' distance. I'd say not, but you are you.

- *Shocking Grasp* You would think that, if anyone, a Blue dragon would have a shocking touch. Nope. Still a fun flavour-effect, especially on idiots in metal armour. If nothing else, this can be their base cantrip... even if your dragon has to go around licking things for it to work.

- *Thunderclap* Would an angry Blue or Bronze have this level of impact on yelling? Probably. Range sucks though.

**Poison** - Green stands alone here, 'the smartest of all dragons'. Her breath kind of blows.

- *Poison Spray* Green gets this cantrip as their 'spit, sneeze &amp; cough' cantrip. Better than nothing, perhaps.

**Honourable Mention Cantrips** 

- *Dancing Lights &amp; Light* You might add either for older metallic dragons // emphasize their *goody, goody, two-shoes* style. 

- *Gust* A dragon that is adult-huge probably has this quasi-magical impact when they exhale. Ancient dragons have lungs / bellows the size of a house. Yes, they can probably *Gust* at will. Puff, the magic dragon!

- *Thaumaturgy* Does an ancient dragon have glowing eyes and other cool stuff just thrown in for free? Why not. You can throw in that *Prestidigitation* too, pending your campaign flavour-savour-favour. 

- *Shape Water* This one makes a lot of sense for shaping any of those mist- or fog- style secondary breath weapons. This would allow them to shape it, assuming it works on atomized water particles. Bonus points for giving this to The Frosties such as Silver (or even an older-smarter White) for shaping the ice near their lair with their breath. Silver would also use this for shaping their firm-cloud stuff. 

*Aside note:* according to 5e lore the greater giants have forgotten how to make cloud castles but older Silvers can do this without making any effort whatsoever. [Things that make you go 'hm'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF2ayWcJfxo).

There you have it. Cantrips you can throw in for free to add some flavour &amp; fun for your dragon. My thanks for reading.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,585,"I recently had tried out an aliment-based puzzle I thought of on my party, and it went very well in my opinion, so I'll share it with you all. This works best with a good mix of alignments, (my party had CG, LG, CN, and a secretly LE, which was perfect).

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** The party was climbing a mountain in the astral plane, to the lair of an evil BBEG. He would want traps that would let someone evil (like himself) pass easily, someone neutral (like minions) pass with difficulty, and deter someone good (like adventurers).

&amp;#x200B;

**Settings:**

 *You continue to follow the path, it growing steeper as it snakes up the mountain, and the rock walls growing smoother and seemingly more difficult to climb. A few hours of trecking pass before you arrive upon a crevice in the mountain.  The rock walls, almost completely smooth now, curve inwards and cuts off into a fault, in which a waterfall flows up the mountain. Crossing the fault is a small rope bridge with flimsy wooden planks to walk on. The bridge extends visibly 15ft into a thick mist that obscures the rest of the path. Before the bridge, inscribed in the ground, is some text, glowing slightly red.*   


**The Text:**   
 *It looks like sygils and symbols that you can't understand, but after a moment they seem to twist and turn and you seem to understand them as words.*    


The text starts the puzzle. Each character sees a different message based on their alignment, and the mist changes to match:  


Evil:

*The text before the bridge reads: “Your actions prove your worth, you are free to continue on your path“. The mist seems to clear and you can see the other side of the bridge.*

Neutral:

*The text before the bridge reads: “You walk the line; you are yet to prove yourself. Feel free to walk the path, but beware it is treacherous. “ The mist remains, and you can see about 15feet down the bridge.*

Good:

*The text before the bridge reads: “Your purity does not belong here, this path is not yours to take.“ The mist thickens and completely obscures the bridge.*  


**The Puzzle:**  
*Evil characters* have no trouble walking across the bridge, it seems like the path is unexpectedly (magically) sturdy.

  
*Neutral characters* have difficulty crossing the bridge. It is difficult terrain, and they have to make acrobatics checks to fall prone. (This is to keep them on the bridge for the third alignment).

  
*Good Alignment* your vision is completely obscured, and in the thick fog you see a character from your backstory (preferably one that they don't like) appear. The (illusory) character will try to bait  the player into hitting it, saying things like ""You are not worthy"", ""This is not your path"", etc. as ell as making an illusory path leading away and trying to make it sound like it's trying to convince the player to leave. If the player does strike out at the illusion, the non-good players in the party will see that they actually hit the ropes of the bridge, cutting them down.  


**Dangers:**

The main danger comes from falling off the bridge. This becomes more likely if the good alignment players  do damage to the bridge. You can adjust your DC's as you want, but falling, causes you to fall into the upward flowing waterfall, which slams you into rocks, making the player take bludgeoning damage and be restrained.  


**My Experience:**

In my party, the lawful good player talked his way out of the illusion, but the chaotic good sorcerer wasted their third level spell on lightning bolt, which ended up breaking both the close and far pole holding the bridge. The druid used wildshape (monkey) to get across, the warlock used Fly on themselves and Levitate on another player to get across (not at the same time) using to third level spells, and tried to climb across the remaining ropes of the bridge, began to fall, and used Reduce (another 3rd level spell) to make crossing easier.   


**Summary:**  
The party didn't take any damage, but they burned a lot of spell slots, and had a lot of fun. This make climbing a mountain more fun, was a trap an evil boss would reasonably put leading to their layer, and isn't a 'health tax'.  


I considered this a 'Hard' puzzle and gave them 375xp (25\*(lv)5\*(difficulty)3).",1,Steal My Puzzle: The Bridge of Heart
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,59,"**Makers Of The Gods**

Under the heading of **God Makers** (MM p.198): *'... if enough Kuo Toa believe a god is real, the energy of their collective subconscious can cause that god to manifest as a physical reality.'* This idea is somewhat illustrated in Terry Pratchet's [Small Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Gods) and to a lesser extent Neil Gaiman's [American Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gods). These books illustrate how gods are conceived and develop with *belief*. Thus they need &amp; crave interest, attention and worship so as to attain their powers &amp;/or substance. In D&amp;D metaphysics, these humble [Murloc-styled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Races_and_factions_of_Warcraft#Murlocs) creatures are somehow experts at this fabrication of gods, possibly due to their insane minds (not explained / not sure? / your choice as DM).

**Possible Plot Potential: Worshippers For Hire:**

- *'If god hands you lemons, get yourself a new god.'*

Would these relatively insane creatures do this *god fabrication&amp; rehabilitation*? Don't they already have a pantheon or two? In truth, the goddess [Blibdoolpoolp](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blibdoolpoolp) neither seems interested... nor jealous... nor even aware of her fishy followers. Also, it is possible for any Archpriest to use *Lesser &amp; Greater Restoration* to cure their own 'insanity'. One can easily draft a campaign where groups of these amphibians become self-aware of their power to create gods. 

**Powers &amp; Challenges of This Godforge**

- Even the smallest of gods (demigods) would be easier and faster to build, and (let's be honest here), much easier to control when things go wrong. Gods of established, residual faiths would spool up faster and more predictably than those right out of imagination or divine drafting boards. Thus, lesser demigods that have been slain, abandoned, lost or otherwise forgotten make ideal worship for these retro-rogue cults.

- If any regrown demigod turned out to be *less than helpful*, the Archpriest could (hopefully) turn off this *collective belief supply* about as easily as this had been put into motion. What could possibly go wrong?

- Depending on your campaign and how much you use Pratchet's *belief = godstuff*, slaves of any kind could speed up this Godseed process. Following D&amp;D lore, psychic sentients (Examples: *Duergar, deep scion &amp;/or any Gith*) may be able to handle this spiritual stuffness better.

- This could become a mutually resounding process. The god would develop to fit the style, energy and mannerisms of the worshipping base. In turn, those worshipping the god would themselves be altered by the thing they worship. Savvy? Yea, this gets complicated.

- For possible lists of slain gods both big and small look near the end of the [Forgotten Realms god list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Forgotten_Realms_deities) provided online. Pick one that you want to see more of. As has been noted: the 5e books have a suspicious number of 'dead' gods that are somehow back without any explanation. This here provides some means for how these almighty creatures could have self-resurrected.

**Adventure Ideas**

- *Religion By Democracy:* Archpriests have restored or awakened a number of god-spirits at once on a lark / did not know what they were doing / better than average success / rolled a crit. Instead of the arch-priests choosing which deserves to thrive above the rest of their sudden godling uprising, they decide that the gods can sort of 'fight it out'. These godlings are allowed to choose any tool, weapon or instrument of their choice so long as some other god accepts the challenge. The god that gains the most favour wins more worship and support. Thus the *Godly Hunger Games* begin: each of these little gods strive to become the one that impresses the followers the most. The ones that lose have to wander off and try their chances at finding real followers elsewhere.... 

- *Dragons, Dragons Everywhere:* The Kuo Toa decide to awaken [both](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic_pantheon) *draconic deity of mating* &amp; the *draconic deity of hatchling protection*. Not only do the remains of these demigods meld, it creates a massive pool-ooze of dragon parts controlled by one demiurge of sentience. This gargantuan metacreature has been nurturing and releasing many hatchlings that swiftly leave this lair to fend for themselves. These wyrmlings are almost exclusively 'colours' (not 'metal' dragons), thereby causing havoc to many nearby civilizations. It is suspected that the dead dragon demigod [Kalzareinad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kalzareinad) is somehow involved... but how? And why?

- *SurReal Estate Prices: The Bottom Literally Drops Out* In XGE we discover Githyanki live on the massive bodies of dead gods left in the Astral plane. For fun (and possibly with bit of spite - Githyanki have a history of being rather shitty to these confused fish people), some Archpriests and retinue awaken any and all godling spirits that with enough remaining lore / starter fuel. As these demigods awaken they each reclaim a specific body... ensuring that entire Githyanki towns get dumped into that cold nothingness of the Astral plane. As this happens the Githzerai see an opportunity and strike. What did the Illithid have to do with this surprisingly fortunate chain of events? Nothing... honest... just observing... who wants to know?

- *Bait &amp; Switch* Arch-priests think they have awoken a great angel or kind demigod. The instructions start out very clear: these semi-merlocs are ordered to hunt down demons, support those who defy fiends and train demon-hunters. After years it is discovered that these orders are not as kind as originally thought: this is just Fraz-Urb'loo (a friendly and charming demon lord of illusion / MToF) that has pretended to be a good and kind divine being so as to have many of his enemies destroyed. Once discovered for what he is, will Frazzie continue to support his fishy friends? Is he 'chaotic evil'? Ask him... go ahead i dare you.

- One of the rarely worshipped demon-gods known as [Dagon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dagon) is upset that he has lost followers and swears comeuppance (read: 'oaths &amp; curses in Abyssal'). In a clever manoeuvre only insane Kuo-Toa would possibly imagine, they begin to worship [Jazirian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazirian), the dead Coatl god in order to defend themselves. Who will win? Stay tuned, kids.

- *Collective insanity* Blibdoolpoolp accidentally gets sucked into this process thanks to some weird backbeat of racial memory. This creates a sort of clone of herself and she begins to battle it out with her other hot-lobster self. Perhaps this is like a *Mirror of Opposition* on steroids? Ha, just grasping at straws at this point.

**Repeating myself here** Found a list of the [dead gods that came back in 5e.](https://www.reddit.com/r/loremasters/comments/2iguk4/dead_gods_come_back_to_life_in_dd_5e/). If you are confused, here is a re-posting of [that list of gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Forgotten_Realms_deities) that includes some of the dead ones. Sadly, there is little mention of gods that just are forgotten, lost, abandoned or just run out of interest. Our very own Famous Hippo has done lots of amazing stuff on gods and religions - if you need some advice, just look at some of his fine stuff in the side column over there on your page. ==&gt;

&gt;“I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment.”

— Finn the Human

The classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons alignment system is a way to categorize a Player Character’s ethical and moral perspectives. It involves two axes with three categories each, crossing each other for a total of nine alignments. They are: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, and Chaotic Evil. This format is popular enough to sometimes be used outside of the RPG hobby entirely.

When D&amp;D started, there were originally only three alignments: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic. This was based on the themes prevalent in Michael Moorcock’s *Elric of Melnibone* saga, and was notably different than the classic trope of “good versus evil.” However, oftentimes the Chaotic creatures and characters were very clearly the villains and the Lawful creatures and characters were very clearly the good guys (even unicorns are lawful in OD&amp;D). Interestingly, the precedent of having druids and gods of nature be Neutral began here. It was more like alignment described your factional allegiance than your personality. When D&amp;D took the next step in 1977 and diverged into *Basic Dungeons and Dragons* and *Advanced Dungeons and Dragons*, both versions added in the second axis and the discussion became more nuanced. There was a notable stripping of the list for 4th Edition (which will have its own analysis in Part 6), which was restored in 5th Edition. 5th Edition also includes “Unaligned,” which is meant to describe beings without the mental capacity for moral or ethical choice (like animals and constructs).

The idea is that the axis of Good versus Evil is “morals,” whereas the axis of Law versus Chaos is “ethics.” This is, intentionally, a vastly simplified interpretation of these two concepts. In previous editions, exact alignment had a much more important mechanical consequence. Classes had alignment restrictions, dictating that *all* Bards must be Non-Lawful and that *all* Paladins must be Lawful Good, for example. Not only that, but many spells, class abilities, and items had effects based on alignment categorization. You might cast a spell that reveals NPCs in the area who are Chaotic, or acquire a sword that can only be wielded by someone Evil, or a belt that reverses the alignment of the wearer to its polar opposite. A cleric’s alignment had to fall within one step of their chosen deity’s alignment on the chart (not counting diagonals). When the cosmology of D&amp;D was being developed (especially through *Planescape*) the exact alignment categorization system became an existential truth of how the universe itself is organized. [There were afterlives for each of the nine alignments](https://imgur.com/a/zbOFoZS), each with its own corresponding gods and sentient outsider race. In 1st Edition AD&amp;D, there were even Alignment Languages: you automatically know a secret language for your alignment (yes, everyone thought this was a really weird idea). The point is that it became important for in-game reasons that your character have a single, designated alignment.

In 5th Edition, almost all of the aforementioned mechanical effects of alignment have been discarded. Now it exists almost purely as a matter of fluff and characterization. This affords more validity to a lot of the more popular interpretations of the system from the past. For example: there has long been a debate about how a PC’s alignment should relate to the Player’s choices. The problem often comes up when the DM overrules the action of a PC with the excuse of “your character can’t do that because it’s against his alignment.” Many people naturally feel like this unnecessarily takes agency away from the player. Some point out, for example, that it conflicts with an implicit rule in the Paladin’s description: a Paladin loses their divine powers if they commit an action that goes far against their alignment. Thus, it is implied that there must be a possibility to begin with for the Paladin’s Player to make a choice against their alignment. This reasoning argues that alignment is supposed to be “descriptive, not prescriptive.” It is a label that changes in reaction to your choices, shifting back and forth as it attempts to describe what you do. That is to say, your actions define your alignment, not the other way around. However, some others have argued that there is some merit in allowing your alignment to at least influence your actions. After all, if you decided to be Lawful Neutral when you made your character, surely you should use that as a guideline and try to stick to that alignment when you play. As a DM, I have never denied a player’s choice on the basis of their alignment, but I now and then will ask, “what’s your alignment again?” after they declare something a bit questionable, and that’s a good enough reminder for them to at least make an *informed* decision.

This is especially prevalent with new players, who often *say* they want to be Good but end up just playing [Chaotic Neutral](https://imgur.com/a/T9gOa4Y), or worse, Chaotic Evil, as it is instinctual for them to just do what they want and think insanely once they’ve entered into this liberating headspace for the first time. This relates to a greater phenomenon of how uncooperative new players tend to be (this is certainly not a rule, it’s just a common trend). For a lot of people, even those who have played video games before, trying D&amp;D for the first time offers them more freedom than they’ve ever had in the past. They can do whatever they want with no consequences and often have much greater power than in real life. Initially, the potential to explore this freedom is more interesting to them than the potential to harness it for a good story, so they dick around and deliberately try to undermine the DM’s authority, the flow of the adventure, their companions’ actions, etc. all “just because they can.” Once they’ve inevitably ruined the adventure, they are likely to learn that it wasn’t nearly as fun as if they had just played along with the story the DM had prepared for them to enjoy. But even after this, they still have a lingering tendency to approach every story point with a purely practical suggestion, sometimes to the point of borderline-sociopathy. “Fuck the hostages, why would I put my neck out for them?” is the sort of mentality they occupy. And that’s a fine enough character to play, but again, it’s not usually because of an informed choice. It’s often because of a pretty bad instinct.

Remember, Alignment is now optional, just like Bonds and Flaws and Ideals and all that crap. It’s just the book giving you some suggestions on how you can approach roleplaying, if you like. I’ve heard some people say it should “shit or get off the pot” by having mechanical consequences again or being removed from the game entirely, but I think there’s no harm in including something that’s purely for fluff purposes. It’s not “useless” just because it has no mechanical effect. Learning to make choices with Law or Chaos and Good or Evil in mind is an important step towards being a more effective role-player, as you can use this framework to organize your options and guide you to decisions you know your character would make and not just yourself. This type of choice has the potential to offer some of the most deeply engaging aspects of roleplaying, which can be explored much more effectively in the loose interpretation of 5th Edition.

But the limits of the system described still provoke a lot of debate. Most interesting to me is how this system defines “ethics” and “morals,” in opposition to how those two ideas are defined in other contexts. This will be explored in [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ae6x6x/character_alignment_part_2_ethics_and_morality/).",1,"Character Alignment Part 1: Intro, History, and the Basics"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,295,"**Summary**: *«The dread claws into your mind as victims of weird ""possession cases"" come back as undead. Folks, scraped in the kerfuffle, start displaying the same symptoms. The immensity of a barely settled frontier gets you claustrophobic shivers: even if, by some miracle, there is someone capable of helping out there – the wilderness in between is vast and full of terrors...»*

&amp;#x200B;

**Premise**: a low-level party is put through a low-key zombie apocalypse. Human corpses are just starting to raise; there may be a horde or two of undead animals ravaging in the woods – and the thrill is to unravel the mystery before the situation hits the point of no return.

**Players' buy-in**: some ""roots"" in the region, a reason to stay when the shit hits the fan. Family ties, half-finished research, divined spot to build a shrine, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# Development

1. *""Possession"" cases* – the party decides to investigate some eery events in an outlying village. During travel, they pick up on worrying signs of a disturbance in nature.
2. *Rabies epidemy?* *Zombie plague!* – all ""possession"" victims have scrapes and the patient zero, a hunter, have bite marks. In his house, a hunting dog and half-flayed bear are found – both undead and blood-thirsty.
3. *Bioweapon? –* a horde of undead animals hits the village. Upon investigation, turns out that oldest corpses have whitish ""roots"" growing through their blood vessels.
4. *«Scott Orson Card, you say...»* – Myconids turns to be an involuntary source of the ""plague"" as their sproutlings poses some innate necromantic abilities.

# 

# Myconids

Mushroom-folk is a good excuse to early throw something alien at players: they're sentient plant-based lifeform, have telepathic communication, metamorphosis and non-evil link to necromancy... I homebrew them a bit, so they procreate by seeding a corpse with spores. The species is from Underdark, a place harsh and violent – so their seedlings developed a defensive mechanism, making their ""compost"" fight off carrion eaters. Spores made by juvenile seedlings aren't strong enough to take over an Underdark monster, who developed immunity against them – but overworld fauna isn't that lucky. 

It's up to you why a ""grove"" of Myconids were forced out from the Underdark. Use the opportunity to foreshadow the next big bad?

&amp;#x200B;

# Setup

The scope is important for any zombie apocalypse – or, otherwise, it's just a bunch of CR 1/4 monsters.

Myconid ""plague"" affected animals first and the increased violence would be the main telltale. Outside of combat encounters, the party might stumble upon sight of a vicious fight. Or bump into newly set elven protective charms. Or hear something from villagers/travelers: a local druid ventured into forests to figure out the reason for ""nature's wrath"" – and never returned. Woodcutters' stories about a man-eating super pack, led by a werewolf. Hushed rumors about hag's witchcraft in play... 

The idea is to later have all mysterious threads to crash-assemble into an all-encompassing canvas with ""WE ARE SCREWED"" on it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Zombies

**Rolling CON saves**

I would suggest adding troglodyte's Stench feature to at least ""elite"" zombies: it makes sense with being around a rotting corpse – and rolling to *""resist the fumes""* might remind players about other ""possessed"" and invoke fear of being infected. For sure do it with the bear in the hunter's hut: half-flayed, ripe with spores – that's appropriately gross for the campaign's first zombie encounter.

Of course, ghouls make great ""elite zombies"" and already have a Con-save rider on their attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**Swarms**

""Being overwhelmed and piled-on"" is iconic zombie imagery. To recreate it, you'd need to use Shove action with the first zombie and go for Grapple with the next one. Both are contested rolls on which a zombie would have only '+1' – so if you follow that tactic, you can throw more of them at the party.

If you don't fill like deploying and managing 10+ zombies, grant them a special action: «***TACKLE***. The target must succeed on DC13 Strength saving throw, or get Prone and Grappled».

&amp;#x200B;

**Facing a horde**

At some point, a horde of zombies should hit the village. Most houses would be abandoned and everyone would hide behind the palisade. I suggest letting the PCs to pick up on signs and give them time to prep the defenses. Have then a grand battle session; here's some inspiration for the encounters: 

* A family from a distant farm took too long to arrive because of their elders – and the horde notices them
* The palisade is breached – clean out the intruders and fend off the horde during hasty fixing
* One of the defenders was wounded. He's swearing that wasn't a bite, but everyone is too terrified to listen
* A pack of undead wolves figured out how to jump on backs of others and leap over the palisade
* Couple hot-headed boys decide to draw away at least part of the hoard by being a bait running away. Zombies turn to be way quicker than they thought and now they are stuck on three/house roof
* An undead giant elk starts raming on the palisade. It's time for a Helm's Deep-like sortie

&amp;#x200B;

**Obligatory body horror (/proper foreshadowing)**

Did players just slay a particularly foul zombie, who literally fell apart from the decomposition? I bet you, they'd want something to rib-breakingly spur out from its chest! Yellow Musk Creeper or Assassin's Vine would dispel the players' last assumptions about how zombies work – and start guessing if all that rumors about ""nature's wrath"" were true.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infected**

A bitten person dying from a zombie infection is a well-known trope. Why not gift such experience to players?

Well, they probably straightforward wouldn't like that. Ordinary, when players hear ""*you're feeling bad"",* they halt the world and throw everything on dealing with that – and will grow more and more irritated with each discarded or failed plan. And, as avoiding being bitten after fighting so much undead is realistically impossible, imposing such terminal condition on players might feel like a punishment in which they were lured by just playing the game.

The reason you might want a character to be infected is to give them a reason to venture deeper into the forest to find the cause of all of this. Someone being infected is trope because it's dramatic. If party have a really intense PC – their player might be into ""doing the right thing"" on a brink of death. If players pounced on the hag rumors, they might hope that killing her would lift the curse – and when they'll find her, you can sweeten the failure by offering a scroll of Greater Restoration in exchange for service and Geas*.* 

If you like the idea – talk privately with a player or two after first zombie encounter and ask if they're okay with being infected. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's D&amp;D, so there is no reason for ""dying from zombie bite"" being an exclusively negative experience. Cursed items in DMG have a positive effect, so let's follow the lead. Set the progression rate as you see fit – maybe, a DC20 CON save each day. Lesser Restoration could be used to ""wash the toxins away"" and postpone the save for the day it was administered.

|STAGE|BENEFICIAL EFFECT|DETRIMENTAL EFFECT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|I|Advantage on CON saves||
|II|Berserk: for 1 minute, before each attack, roll 2d4 and chose to allocate the dice to Attack, Damage or split it between both. Take a point of Exhaustion afterward|DC10 Wisdom save each time taking damage – or go Berserk|
|III|""Undead fortitude"" feature|Upon a kill, make a DC13 Wisdom saving throw or spend a turn consuming the flesh|

# How does it end?

**Myconids Ex Machina**

Creation of a zombie is an innate ability of infantile sproutlings, it's an adaptation to protect the ""compost"" from carrion eaters. Of course, the adaptation would not stick if adult Myconids weren't able to avoid being swarmed by zombie hoards – hence, spore cloud with the ability to pacify the undead.

Myconids could try to shepherd the undead hordes deeper into the forest when they'll peacefully decompose. The reason why would they do so is dependent on why are they here. If something forced them out of Underdark – PCs can deal with that. Was it a rift between planes – Myconids will demand a portal back *(or, alternatively, acceptance of their claims on the forest)*.

If such resolution feels cheap – go through with implications of hordes of undead roaming in the region. Let's the party organize clean-up patrols, evacuate people, beseech powerful NPCs in the woods to help with containing the threat. Remember, zombies are just ""walking compost"" – and when sproutlings go through their full circle, hordes will start disintegrating. If no new victims would be infected, of course. 

&amp;#x200B;

**«It's not our fight»**

Just straightforwardly bailing out is also an option. Hell, with the prospect of being bitten and the overwhelming number of foes – I'd book out to. In this case, throw at the party encounters with the undead, some murderous refugees, make them fight for their resources – go full ""the facade of civility fell with the civilization"".  

&amp;#x200B;

**Developing an immunity**

Spores, produced by infantile Myconid sproutlings, do not work on Underdark monsters because their immune system accommodated and able to deal with them. Overworld dwellers, however, have no chance yet to develop immunity – because toxins, produced by scroutlings, kill them fast. A week or two of dedicated administration of Lesser Restoration or Neutralize Poison will grant victims' immune systems time to train and deal with the intruder.

&amp;#x200B;

# Afterthoughts

I clearly can see how Oathbreaker paladins and high-level Necromancer would like to claim a domain over the forest because of their abilities to command undead. Always handy to have material for your thralls nearby.

And some alchemist would definitely dream of a way to form a symbiotic relationship with a sproutling – so it could inject battle cocktails into the host's bloodstream and otherwise enhance survivability. Witcher-like order, a tribe of biopunk barbarians – even you don't like the adventure, this Myconids can offer your game something.",1,"Adventure idea: Zombie ""plague"" (no necromancers involved)"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,35,489,"Inspired by recently learning about the rise of [Genghis Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVTVF6ioaY), I wanted to apply this kind of historical success story to my D&amp;D world. To me, the Underdark represents not just the monsters under the bed of society, but also chaos. Even though settlements exist and the like, the Underdark is not a place of order, giving me the second and third ingredient to apply to my Duergar.


So what makes these Duergar unique? A few things.

1.	*Order*. The Duergar of the Monster Manual have never really screamed LAWFUL Evil to me, so I wanted to adjust that, particularly in terms of equipment too.

2.	*United*. So where would this order come from? Well, like the Mongol Hordes of Genghis Khan, the Duergar clans would be united under one single emperor.

3.	*Drow*. The Duergar and the Drow serve as dark reflections of Dwarves and Elves – in this Underdark there would not be room for the two of them. United by their emperor, the Duergar war machine had crushed the Drow.


All these points flow from one unifying figure – this **Emperor/ Empress Figure**. In relation to the rest of the Duergar community, the actual individual does not mean much, it is merely the unifying force they direct. They should be totally powerful over the Duergar and it should be unlikely they are overthrown. In my campaign, this Emperor is a mystic, of the Order of Immortals, surviving for aeons and guiding his people from growth to growth. This means I could create a history of events and still have a stable Duergar society in the present. 


Now Genghis Khan was able to unite the Mongol hordes due to a few key areas. Tactics, Military Organisation and Direction. So, the Emperor figure would provide the same for the Duergar – making them equal to/ better than the Drow warriors so as to achieve our third point. How would we do this? Well, in combat the way our Duergar fight should be the opposite of the Drow. The Drows warriors are characterised by capable elite fighters and consistent casters. So how do we counter that, bearing in mind our influences?



**Organisation**
The Duergar would fight like the Romans, utilising a meritocratic system of organisation. Shield walls and stabbing blades that can’t be stopped under a relentless march. I divided units into groups of ten – 5 wide, 2 deep. They would execute the typical [Testudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testudo_formation) formation in combat. Each unit would have a Wu Jen mage attached with a few key abilities. I chose not to use the (clunky) UA Mystic rules, instead giving them spellcasting and a few other abilities, drawing ideas from the UA Sidekick rules. Key spells would be *Counterspell, Fireball, Sending* and *Pass without Trace*. Their role is twofold - to undo Drow Casters and neutralise them and hordes of slaves that the Drow might throw at them. Secondly, to direct the unit. I gave them an ability to communicate with the members of the unit telepathically, however this would only work as a one-way directive.



**Natural Abilities**
So now we have a unit of highly organised, well-trained soldiers fighting as one, in near total silence. The Duergar can grow to twice the size via *Enlarge*, but much more dangerous and intimidating in this regard is their ability to turn invisible. So I gave them Chain Shirts over Scale Mail as per the MM. Now they had no disadvantage on stealth, so could sneak around whilst still being directed as one by the Wu Jen mage. They could infiltrate anywhere, tear down anything and are a relentless fighting force – the perfect answer to the Drow.



**Direction**
Fighting was a Mongol warriors bread and butter, and gave them direction. They would be too busy at war to play politics and revolt against the Khan. For our Duergar this would come in a few forms, with the face of Duergar society evolving somewhat. Firstly, they would always continue to fight, executing campaign after campaign against their foes. Not fruitlessly too – they would not be stuck in unproductive endless war – their threat must be real and present. They would fight alongside creatures such as the Githyanki against the Mindflayers, chasing them deeper into the Underdark.

Secondly, the role of their Priests would be somewhat larger. Duergar views on afterlife would probably also focus on combat – to die in battle being the greatest possible achievement for them. So their priests would reflect this – the priests of Deep Duerra are said to train the Duergar soldiers – they would become Kensei monks. The priests of Laduguer would be somewhat more mystical, offering teachings and directives to their people, and punishing transgressors accordingly – they would become Monks of the Long Death.

Thirdly, with the Drow gone, the Duergar could exert order on their levels of the Underdark. To provide more interaction with the PCs, they would reside as close to the surface as possible, controlling most of that upper layer. Their strongholds would become fortified cities, and they would control highly defended pathways between the cities. These would allow for quick passage under the surface world if they could be accessed by the PCs. But the threat of the Duergar would be undone if they became too present in the politics of the surface world diplomacy. So they would remain aloof to surface dwellers, ignoring any official negotiations and being just short of hostile in their presence. Thus the threat of a highly developed, capable military nation, just underneath the feet of surface society was realised.



**Duergar Society**
I wanted to then further emphasise the role of the units of 10 of the soldiers, making them more than just a military unit. These bonds would remain outside battle, with the 10 becoming much more tight-knit. Duergar are meant not to show much emotion and be totally rigid and unforgiving – this would apply still to these units, but they would share a deep loyalty to one another, and the common ambition that unites the Duergar as a race. With arranged marriages being appointed by the priesthood of the Duergar, the units would have a further role to play. If the significant other of a Duergar were to die, then it would be expected that a member of their unit would step in and remarry this Duergar. This gave a sense of these marriages being even more utilitarian than as expressed in MToF, but of the bonds within a unit being much more meaningful.

I have been DMing for about 1 year (pen and paper). The thing that has inspired me the most of my time in the DnD community is how willing people are to share their hard work to improve the game for others.

As you can imagine, I've learned a lot about Dungeons &amp; Dragons and how to be a ~~good~~ adequate Dungeon Master. In the early days, I spent a lot of my time creating ""what-if"" scenarios to help flesh-out my world. As a new DM, I wasn't confident that I could improvise encounters and stories while maintaining all of the rules and flavour of the campaign in my head. I needed a system that helped me feel less pressure to perform, and allowed me to be present to the players while still keeping the game moving.

I thought there may be some DMs out there, or people considering trying it, who love to write their own story arches, but would benefit from having a few plug &amp; play encounters in their back pocket. I formatted this encounter to be ambiguous enough to plug into any campaign, but still add depth to your world. It includes narration, skill checks, an encounter, and some loot! To add that extra magic, I asked a dear friend (u/majdulf) to create some art for these encounters.

Well now it's time to become an adventurers' guild!

This is a system I've been thinking about for some time, and I finally broke the back of it. I wanted something that would be a cross between Assassin's Creed's Contract system, and Lords of Waterdeep's party-centricness. I wanted NPCs to be separated into some approximation of character class, as well as gain experience and level up.

What I've managed to make is a way to automatically generate a roughly right-feeling d100 table for the missions you send your teams on. It was made using Desmos, a very handy graphing calculator.

##[Here is the link as of 4/1/19](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0xdysn1gwb)

##[Here is the new link!](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cvqynfd14c)


The possible outcomes are:

* Critical success - The mission succeeds, and there's extra treasure, more opportunities, vital information or lashings of ginger beer
* Success - The mission succeeds, the treasure is gained, your brand is that little bit more established in the city/region
* Mixed Outcome - The mission sort of goes alright? Some equipment is lost, your reputation suffers, very little loot is got
* Failure - The team was forced to retreat! A persistent failure state is incurred in that region and your reputation there suffers
* Failure Requiring Intervention - The situation is so bad that they need to call you in, as a Failure but you need to do something about it

The framework of this is:

* The DM chooses some missions from a bank of missions that will exist at some point
* These are the available missions, the PCs know up front what the risk and rewards involved are
* The mission will call for a given party configuration [like so, as in Lords of Waterdeep](https://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quest-deliver-weapons-to-selunes-temple.jpg), the PCs choose the best team they can to approximate that, there's a penalty for ill-fitting teams. Some missions will require certain classes or else they'll autofail.
* Based on the difficulty of the mission, the levels of the NPCs (Not necessarily on the same 1-20 scale the PCs use) and the propriety of the team for the job, probabilities are calculated by functions I've written. They're hyperbolic tangents.
* The DM calculates the odds either at-table or between sessions while the NPCs are away, allowing for a simple d100 roll despite the complex maths.





Open questions and things to do:

* Look at making it so there's always a chance of failure, even when you're vastly overleveled [Fixed 5/1/19]
* Look at implementing some kind of equipment system, where you can stack your team with magic items to give them a better chance, but risk their loss if they fail
* Explore changing the maths so that some missions emphasise a mixed result
* Start a bank of missions with success/fail consequences
* Decide how to split NPCs into classes. Lords of Waterdeep uses the classic 4 classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief)
* Explore splitting missions into categories as in Lords of Waterdeep, with a bonus based on your guilds' speciality
* Decide how to pace the levelling up of NPCs, how many level-appropriate missions should you have to do for each level? If you fail do you gain more ore less experience?
* Evaluate putting in some kind of [quirk](https://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Quirk) system as in Darkest Dungeon, whether on an RP level or a mechanical level
* Do you need to pay your NPCs? How much? Is that another thing to calculate based on level?
* Look at franchising - How do you quantify your brand awareness in a given town/region? What happens when you gain a lot of good reputation points?
* Look at making this in my own custom webplace rather than in Desmos

TL;DR - [This link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cvqynfd14c) will take you to an autogenerated d100 table for away missions, where the inputs are straightforward but the calculation is complicated.

Thanks a lot for looking at this, let me know what you think! Feel free to play around with it and change the workings up!

Edit: If you'd like a notification when I post updates, message me your email address and I'll let you know.

Edit 5/1/19: Hey! I've changed around the functions a little, finding a neat solution to do with logarithms that fixes the top issue, where there would be a 0 chance of failure if you're overleveled.

I'm playing with the idea of including a factor so that, even if you're matching the level of the mission, it's still harder to beat higher-level missions. I'm open to any comments and messages with input on that.",1,Agent Placement System V0.1 - Proof of Concept and Maths

With a new year comes fresh motivation for productivity and creativity. In January we will workshop some adventures together. Some people find it hard to create a whole adventure alone, even if it is just a oneshot, but luckily BTS is full of amazing DMs and content creators who can help others out.


So this month **we will split up the process of creating an adventure into 9 managable sections**. The goal is to give everyone a chance to participate. And the threads will not be locked, so even if you join the party late you can still enter your work for each event. Commenting on other users' entries is highly encouraged, help each other make the best story you can.


---

### The Prize
At the end of the month **we will choose the best adventures**. There will be three winners, one will be selected by the moderators of BTS, while the other two will be voted for by the community. The prize for the writers of these adventures comes in two parts. First, **they will be given a flair of their choice**. Second, **they will be granted a one time exemption from our advertising rule**. After they post their work on DMsGuild, we’ll drop a link to that work in the winner announcement thread (as long as it’s set as “Pay What You Want”).


We hope this theme month, as well as the prize will lead to more people writing and sharing their adventures in the future. And even if this is the only adventure you write, you’ll at least be able to be proud of this one.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,52,555,"#History    
     
For many years, Jezean the black pestilence caused terror among all of the people in her domain. She destroyed caravans, tortured her food, and ruled with an iron fist.    
   
However she soon found a rival. A bronze dragon named Adrex had moved to the beach nearby her swamp. He had traveled down from the north where he heard about Jezean. Wanting to prove himself, he tried to defeat the black dragon.     
They were evenly matched and retreated with neither one wanting to lose their life.     
    
For many years afterward, the two of them clashed every couple decades. Jezean wanting to have her undisputed rule over the area again and Adrex wanting to protect the local people. However the more they fought, the more the two started to respect each other.    
Jezean enjoyed seeing Adrex's unwavering determination. It reminded her of how she was just as ambitious as him. She enjoyed a challenge now and again, something that Adrex could only provide her in this isolated place.        
Adrex could not deny that Jezean had a great deal of power. Despite her evil, her zeal was something he respected.   
     
Adrex started to talk to his opponent before every battle. While Jezean usually ended up attacking him anyways, she humored him anyways.    
These pre battle chats started as threats to each other, but eventually devolved into Adrex scolding Jezean for acting up. She didn't want to bother attacking Adrex as no one ever won, so she tried to seduce him to distract him from protecting his people. However her empty lust blossomed into something more with him as they soon grew very close.    
     
But 10 years ago, they did the most taboo thing a dragon could do: cross breed across scales. Their son Kriv would be an abomination to all other dragons as both sides would see him tainted by the other.    
   
The two of them split up.  
Jezean changing her shape into an old half orc crone who is thought to be a witch. Many people fear her because they think that she will curse anyone who enters her swamp. Really Jezean is a good actor who doesn't attack humanoids unprovoked anymore.    
Adrex retreated to his beach where he lives in a coral reef with his son Kriv. Adrex is doing his best to try to keep Kriv a secret, but Kriv's free spirit makes him hard to tie down. When he reaches the surface, Adrex takes the form of a water genasi noble.   
     
#Personalities   
    
Despite being in a forbidden love with Adrex, Jezean still retains some of her black dragon tendencies. She doesn't like humanoids much, but doesn't actively attack them anymore. And she rarely speaks to anyone without mentioning Adrex sending them first.  
In her isolation, she has learned a few magical tricks here and there. She's quite proficient in druidic magic and can cast just like an archdruid can. Some people seek her for deals, charms, and curses, but she isn't interested in that sort of thing. But she will point towards the local hag in the swamp. Jezean has tolerated the presence of the hag only so she can send people to go to the hag instead. When someone does attack Jezean, she has no qualms in turning into her true form and eating them whole.   
She is still deeply in love with Adrex, but knows they can't be found out. She trusts him to keep Kriv safe, but will be incredibly angry at him for letting Kriv get out. Being a not very good mother, she'll scold Kriv for being the cause of all her problems.  
   
Adrex spends most of his time underwater in his dragon form. He'll search for treasure and art from shipwrecks and bring them back to his reef. When he goes onto the surface, he will turn into his water genasi form and trade with the local people. Adrex likes to present himself well, so he's always wearing fine but flexible garments in genasi form.   
He searches for nice things to bring back to Kriv. While Adrex can never let his son be known to the world, he tries to bring parts of the world back to him. Although he's a bit of an overprotective dad and will attack anyone who threatens Kriv.    
Adrex does have many metallic dragon allies in different parts of the world. He occasionally flies over to them to see how they're doing. None of them know about Kriv, but some are getting a bit suspicious with how Adrex isn't as active with the other ancient metallics.  
    
Among all dragons there is a general agreement: chromatics and metallics should never mix. To do so would be a grievous sin to both Tiamat and Bahumat. Any dragon would slaughter a mixed heritage child as they see their color tainted by the other.   
Kriv is only a wyrmling at the moment, but he is growing up fast. He inherits traits from both black and bronze dragons. From his father, he has his dislike for harming humans, desire to be strong, and enjoyment of water. From his mother, Kriv got her ambition, preference for food to be treated with acid, and disregard for established structures. This leads to him being a playful, but destructive dragon. He wants to get strong like his dad, but is willing to do more than his father does. He doesn't hate humans, but won't help them either. Mostly what he wants to do is get powerful things, although Adrex usually takes them away when Kriv gets a strong magic item.   
Adrex tries his hardest to keep Kriv a secret from everyone else. Kriv spends his time at the reef his father has curated, playing with the toys that Adrex brought back. While Kriv knows who his mother is, he has only met her once or twice. Her narcissistic personality isn't something he likes very much, so he's fine with staying with Adrex.     
Kriv has gained the powers of both black and bronze dragons, having immunity to acid and lighting while being able to breath both. He also has a repulsion breath like his father.   
Kriv is actually completely ignorant of his status among dragonkind. Adrex usually tells Kriv that it's a dangerous world above the ocean and he should stay below. But this tends to make Kriv want to go see the surface world even more, as he thinks that a challenge can make him get strong like his parents did when they used to fight each other.    
   
#Plot hooks   
     
All three members of this dragon family can have some interesting plot hooks. I'll give three for each member:   
    
If you meet Jezean first:   
   
- While walking on the road, the party is surprised by a snake that pops out and turns into an elderly half orc woman. She sees the party headed to the town near where Adrex lives and asks if they can deliver it to him. The letter is a love letter written in draconic with some coins as a gift for Adrex.   
- The party meets the actual hag of the swamp who wants to mess with Jezean. She asks the party if they can go to Jezean's shack and take one of her hairs. The hag will give a magic item to the party in return. The shack turns out to just be something Jezean has built over her old lair to hide her true form.    
- Someone in town asks the party to see where their friend went. Turns out their corpse was ripped in half by Jezean when someone acted too rude around her. Even though Adrex has tried to restrain Jezean, she is still an evil dragon   
   
If you meet Adrex first:    
    
- A noble water genasi merchant requests the presence of the players. He asks them to deliver a letter to Jezean. It is also a love letter that is written in draconic   
- While the players are buying one of Adrex's wares, everyone in town goes slient and makes a path for Jezean in her crone form. She yells at Adrex in draconic about how one of his metallic friends was flying over the area recently and how they could be busted at any moment. If she sees anyone who obviously speaks draconic like a dragonborn or lizardfolk, she'll ask the party to move aside as she needs to talk to Adrex.   
- Adrex asks the party to go find an oddly colored dragon who has been causing chaos in the area recently. He is very serious about the party restraining and not killing the dragon. He'll meet with them at the beach at midnight. If they return with Kriv in hand, he'll give them a healthy sum of money and reveal his bronze dragon form before retreating to the sea floor.    
     
If you meet Kriv first:    
    
- While the party is walking into the region, they are blocked by a very young dragon. This one is unlike any they've ever seen with horns both going forward and back, scales that alternate between a bright bronze and a dark black, and wing membrane that is a mix between purple and green. He sees how strong the party members are and really wants to fight them. But he won't fight until the party members agree to do so. Later on, the party will probably find Adrex and Jezean searching frantically for their child.    
- Kriv goes through the town searching for more magic items to play with. If any party members meet up with him, he'll want to fight over the magic items. Adrex goes running after Kriv, but refuses to drop his water genasi persona.    
- While the party is out on the water for whatever reason, Kriv hops out and wants to play with the party. But the party sees the massive silhouette of his father approaching. Kriv begs the party to make the boat go faster because Kriv wants to see the world. If Adrex catches up, he'll take Kriv back underwater and let the party go without any trouble. But he begs them to never tell any other dragon about his son.    
    
And here are some general additional ones:   
    
- One of the metallic dragons Adrex is friends with might have been allies with the party. They ask the party to go investigate why Adrex has been so quiet lately. They'll give the party a description of his humanoid form and an emblem that shows that the party came from that metallic.   
- Kriv did manage to evade his parents' watchful eyes and escaped to go see the world. He found the party to be noticeably strong and follows them around watching how they fight. Although he doesn't make himself an ally, preferring to just watch and learn.   
- Adrex and Jezean feel the need to act out a fight every half century or so to throw people off the fact that they gave birth to Kriv. So people from all over are traveling to their region to watch the fight unfold between two legendary ancient dragons. Neither of them kills the other or harms any humanoid life, but their battle is a sight to behold.   
- A small army of Bahumat's followers are recruiting new members. They want to go on a hunt for a mixed heritage dragon they heard reports of.     ",1,"Jezean, Adrex and Kriv, a secret family of black and bronze dragons you can add to your game"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,202,"*These first few paragraphs are just my own personal experience. If you want to understand how I plan sessions, skip down to Planning the Session.*

Planning Dnd sessions used to be something I would do constantly. I was in high school, with no job, and easy classes so most of my time would be spent preparing for my weekly Dnd game. I would slavishly spend hours upon hours working on the same session, fine-tuning it to the point of ridiculousness. I would have elaborate plans for what my players would do as they would go about the session, and each step of the plan would lead to bigger and more complicated results that would end in a climactic finale! 

Instead, what would happen is I would then start the session and within 5 minutes of letting the players loose, they would choose the ""wrong"" choice and completely derail all of the planning I had up to that point, and I would have to scramble to come up with some semblance of a story. After having my plans torn to shreds over and over again, I changed my philosophy on how I designed sessions and took the opposite extreme. Zero planning at all. 



Initially, this worked really well. If someone asked me to DM a game and gave me 5 minutes to prepare for it I was able to create something serviceable and entertaining. Sometimes, a lot of things wouldn't make a lot of sense, but we didn't care we were in a world where firebreathing lizards took to the skies and kidnapped princesses. For the past 2 years, I have stuck with this style, and it isn't until I started playing in a brand new homebrew world that I began to notice chinks in its armor. 

One of the reasons I was able to so successfully pull off the improv style in the past was because I was doing it in a setting I was intimately familiar with, my homebrew world of [Arla](https://arla.obsidianportal.com/). Creating NPC's and plot threads was a breeze because I knew the world so well. If I created a certain mannerism, or if they had a specific accent that I came up with while playing I could easily say that they are from Tinder city and immediately know a ton about them and what they believed. 



When I tried to do it in a world I wasn't as familiar with, I no longer had that ease of creating that I was so used to having in my main world. Characters turned from interesting and complex with a quick and easy backstory, to simply being caricatures of common fantasy tropes. For the past few months, I have been struggling with figuring out why that campaign felt hollow to me, and the answer lied in me not preparing sufficiently for my sessions.

Moving into 2019, I began to prepare for my first session of the year and I decided to stream it. [Here is the YouTube link for those who are interested in watching.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJCs6zWbIvs) (Gollicking members are not allowed to watch!) Why this is interesting is because, for the first time in over 2 years, I was sitting down to actually prepare one of my sessions instead of just trusting that I can improv my way through it. And I discovered that planning sessions is actually incredibly fun, and is something I should absolutely be doing! I also learned that the way I have planned sessions in the past has been incredibly flawed and that to become a better DM I don't need to forgo planning entirely, but instead be smarter about how I use my time spent planning. 

#Planning the Session

With all of that out of the way, we can now start talking about the meat and potatoes, planning the session. First things first, I think that in order to understand and prepare your session, it helps to understand what happened in the last session. If you take notes or have someone in the party take notes, it can really help you to tie the sessions together in the future. I know that I am horrifically bad at remembering what happened in the session that happened just a week ago, trying to call back to a session from a year ago is almost impossible. Something as simple as bullet points, or even just a single sentence summing up the session is good enough to help you jog your memory. 



Once you have begun to understand your past, the next step is to figure out what you want from the session. Do you want to have a battle on top of a train? Are you interested in featuring an Aboleth? Will they meet the resistance group of the city? Write this stuff down as things you want to happen during the session. Write it in as story beats that you are interested in having. It's not vital how the players get to it, all you have to know is that you want your players to experience it. The circumstances leading up to it are volatile and shouldn't be planned for, but the actual event is something you can prepare for. You have to be wary that you are worldbuilding instead of plotbuilding. Worldbuilding leads to a great sandbox for the players to explore. Plotbuilding straps the players to some rails and requires them to explore the world exactly how you envisioned it. If you want to read more about this aspect of planning, I write more about it here. 

The last thing I do when I start preparing for my sessions is to simply worldbuild. As much as I love envisioning what the players might do when they get into my world, the truth of the matter is I can't plan 5 steps ahead of them. Instead, I spend my time creating a world that feels real and can handle the players traveling to their heart's content. DMing is largely improv, and preparing for the improv is an important step of the process. 

#Conclusion

Preparing for my sessions is something that I will constantly be improving upon. Going from overplanning to no planning, to somewhere in the middle is quite the change but it has taught me a lot about planning and what is good to plan for, and what is unnecessary. When preparing your sessions there is a simple 3 step process that I like to follow. First, you need to understand your previous sessions and remember what is important about them. Second, write down what you want to experience in the next session and put it down as a bullet point that you would like to explore. Finally, spend the rest of your time worldbuilding as this is the best way to prepare to improv, as this is how you can connect all of the bullet points together. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,410,"Description: 

The Dream Person has a humanoid shape and is about 1.9 meters tall. He looks like a white spirit with no facial or somatical characteristics and has a deep voice that echoes when he speaks. He behaves just like a normal human being and can be communicated with in any language whenever encountered.

Backstory: 

The Dream Person (referenced as DP from now on) was once a Warlock who lived thousands of years ago. His life was that of a simple farmer, who had a wife and a daughter. One day the army of a neighboring town (note: that town must exist in the players campaign) raided the village for supplies, killing everyone in the process except the DP who was in the brink of death when he started hearing voices of an entity promising to give him back his wife and daughter if he served it (note:resurrection magic was not supposed to exist at that time, but there were legends of entities capable of bringing people back to life). He accepted the offer and his wounds spontaneously healed. After decades of doing the entities bidding as a warlock and fulfilling his side of the deal, he went to meet the entity he has been serving face to face. Upon arriving there the entity admitted that it did not have the ability to resurrect and thought that the DP would die just like another pawn in its plan. Upon hearing that the DP fought against the entity and managed to defeat it, consuming the powers of said entity. The DP at that time succumbed to his heavy injuries and died, leading to his spirit receiving the power of the entity, instead of his body. His spirit then remained in that space for thousands of years... Until the day PCs entered said space.

Side quest:

The DP will enter the players minds without them being by any means aware of it and stay with them wherever they go. The PCs will only encounter the DP during long rests in their dreams and only one PC can encounter him at a time. The players cannot willingly encounter the DP. Only the DP will be able to select whether or with whom he will communicate. The DP can in no way harm the players and will communicate with them in the Dreams, leaving hints of his past inside them but will not speak about it. The DP has been isolated so long that he has forgotten his name, but remembers the names of his wifa and daughter. The DP will be able to see everything from the players eyes. In ancient areas he may give hints about them if the PC currently meeting him requests so. In other words, he will act as a guide from time to time. After having the PCs spend enough time with the DP, he will request one of two things:To either kill him (if he believes the PCs are good people) or materialize his spirit in an ancient altar he will point out (if he believes the PCs won't interfere with his plans). If the PCs refuse, the DP will stay with them, requesting the same thing from time to time. If they accept, the altar will materialize the DP in the form the PCs were seeing in their dreams and DP will thank them and fly off.

Ending:

The DP was actually planning to destroy the town that was responsible for the murder of his village after he learned of its existence in the present day through the players (or through their eyes). If the players arrive at that town soon enough they will meet the DP getting ready to destroy it or catch him in the act of doing so. Otherwise if they are late, they will see him standing in front of the town, with the town completely burned and bodies around him. The DP will once again thank the players (no matter the situation they catch him doing) and will ask that you let him do what he is doing (if he hasn't destroyed the town) or ask that there is no need to fight and that he won't hurt anyone ever again (if he destroyed it).

If the PCs leave him be: he will thank them one last time and they won't see him again. Some time later they will wake up and find a map that points a stash of powerful weapons. Behind the map they will find a message saying: ""Thank you and happy dreams""

If they fight and kill him: If the town is destroyed they will not receive anything

If the town is in the middle of getting destroyed they will receive a very big reward from the town

If the town has not been harmed yet: they will receive a big reward",1,Side quest idea: The Dream Person

## My Problem with 5e Currency

Long story short, I have a problem with the way gold coins are worth next to nothing in D&amp;D. It’s an immersion-breaking thing for me.

In my mind, rather than making a gold coin a day, a peasant laborer would likely never even see a gold coin. A chest of gold coins should literally be a king’s ransom, rather than the price of a non-magical suit of armor. If you can fill a pouch with gold, you should be able to buy land and title, not just a breastplate.

I want it to be a big moment for my players if they find gold, like it would be if you found gold coins in real life. Their first thought should be “we’re rich!”

So, I set out to tweak D&amp;D’s money system for my games, with a few simple goals:

* Make precious metal coins like gold and platinum rarer and worth way more
* Be easy to understand
* Translate easily to and from 5e defaults

## Historical Inspiration

European coinage has a lot of variation, and I don’t want to get too deep into that. What I wanted was a simple, consistent, historical standard to compare to. The best I found was the Roman Empire’s coinage under Diocletian and Constantine.

|Coin|Denarius (bronze)|Radiate (bronze) |Nummus (bronze)|Argenteus (silver)|Solidus (gold)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value in Denarius|1|5|25|100|1000|

I like the idea of keeping a coin like the denarius, which is recognizable as a daily wage coin. This makes it easy for players to know how much small amounts of money are worth. The gold piece is that coin in 5th edition, which works great for me aside from the aforementioned devaluing of gold. I also wanted a smaller coin to handle stuff like buying an ale, so I added a copper coin to my scale.

I also love that D&amp;D money works by powers of 10, because it’s so easy to convert, so I kept that (aside from platinum).

So, with that in mind, this is the scale I came up with. The names are generic here so that I can have different in-world cultures mint coins with their own names which correspond to these values.

|Coin|Copper penny|Bronze penny|Bronze mark|Silver mark|Gold piece|Platinum piece|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value in bronze pennies or 5e gp |1/10|1|10|100|1000|5000|

It has a direct and easy translation from 5e: your gp are now bronze pennies. This makes it really easy to use existing loot tables, adventures, etc. or for players to translate a character between my system and a vanilla one.

I've started using this in two campaigns so far, and the results have been exactly what I hoped. I had a great moment in a campaign with my wife when a wizard NPC took out a gold coin and slid it across the table to her. The look on her face was priceless when I explained that to her low-level, relatively sheltered ranger character, this money represented years of income for her family.",1,Making gold worth something: a reworked 5e currency scale
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,34,282,"Goblins, kobolds, kuo-toa: there are many monsters that exist in the Monsters Manual and beyond that are presented as swarming monsters. Creatures that number in the dozens when they attack, using the overwhelming weight of their number to fight your party. However, in the standard initiative fight system, Dungeon Masters and players alike are unlikely to enjoy twelve initiatives rolled in order. I don't believe the mob rules presented in the DMG fully solve the problem. This system provides a fun, flavorful, and easy to run way to deal with numbers of monsters up to the hundreds.

A dogpile begins when 3 or more creatures occupy a larger creature's space. Whether or not a creature is allowed to take the Dogpile Action is up to the Dungeon Master.

**The Dogpile Action** 

The creature moves up to its speed and shares space with its target. Any number of creatures who also have the dogpile action within 30 feet may use their reaction to move up to their speed and join the dogpile.

**Dogpile Rules.**

* A dogpile shares space with its target and moves with its target.

* A dogpile also gives its target a +1 bonus to AC for every two creatures in the dogpile.

* The maximum size of a dogpile is 20 creatures.

* A dogpile shares initative with its target and takes its turn immediately before.

* **Dogpile Save DC.** For many of the features associated with this ruleset, creatures will have to attempt a skill check or saving throw. For these, the DC equals 8 + half the number of creatures in the dogpile.

**Damaging the Dogpile.**

Each creature within a dogpile has 5 HP and AC equal to the AC of one of its members. Any damage done to the dogpile determines how many of its creatures are affected.

For instance: A dogpile that takes 10 damage loses two of its members. A dogpile that takes 14 damage loses two of its members. A dogpile that takes 15 damage loses three of its members.

The dogpile gets to save against area of effect spells once using the bonus of one of its members. The dogpile's target makes the save with disadvantage. 

**Dogpile Actions.**

The creature can take one action for every 5 creatures in the dogpile. For example, four creatures can take one action, five creatures can take two, six creatures can take two. 

* **Knock'em down.** The dogpile target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This creature is grappled until the end of its next turn. 

* **Disarm.** The dogpile target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or drop one item it is holding. The target can, thereafter, attempt a Strength (Athletics) check to

* **Disrobe.** The dogpile target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or lose 1 AC as a piece of its armor is stripped away. Minimum AC = 10 + its Dexterity modifier.

* **Steer.** The dogpile target must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check or immediately move up to half its movement in a direction of the dogpile's choice.

* **Bite, Scratch, Tear.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d6) slashing damage for every two creatures in the dogpile.

***Panther's Note -*** This is deity 5 out of 6 in my series called “The Church of the Light”. Links to the other deities may be found in the ""Allies of the Faith"" section. Eldatha can easily be used without the context of the other solar deities.

I stole the name from ""Eldath"" from an established canonical deity, but other than the name, this is an OC goddess I designed after reading the original Hippocratic Oath. The section on ""Telial Half-Elven"" is based on the character of a tablemate who was lost to depression before we could finish his quest.

In keeping with Telial's character, I recommend Eldatha as a patron deity for anyone who seeks to share compassion, mercy and a passion for learning at their D&amp;D table.

###***Names***

The Lady of Compassion, The Healing Light, The Great Physician.

###***Appearance and Symbols***

Older depictions of Eldatha show an elven or human woman carrying a staff. Generally speaking, the oldest depictions show Eldatha as an Eladrin, and the more recent depictions show a human with a solar crown. However, modern Church of the Light aesthetics shy away from depictions of The Light as mere mortals, so most depictions of her are allegorical. She is commonly depicted as the 4th ray of the Holy Sun, or by her personal sigil, a single winged snake entwined around a hawthorn staff. Hawthorn flowers are sacred to Eldatha. She is heavily associated with Couatls.

###***Origin***

Eldatha is a very ancient deity that certainly predates The Church of the Light, so there are many disagreements over Eldatha’s divine origin.  Within The Church of the Light, Eldatha is largely believed to be a human, who was raised by Tatiana after being abandoned in the woods as a babe. Unfortunately, if Eldatha is human, then her grandson, Prince Nuada, is a half-elf, and that raises many uncomfortable questions for elves who have not treated half-elves kindly.

Elves are far more comfortable believing that Eldatha is a flesh-and-blood Elven child of Queen Tatiana, because it side-steps the issues of half-elven legitimacy surrounding the deity, Prince Nuada. 

Despite the difference in opinion regarding where Eldatha came from, the rest of her origin is fairly consistent across national and racial divides. Whether she is Tatiana’s flesh-and-blood daughter, or an adopted human daughter, Eldatha is held in very high esteem by her mother, The Queen of Summer.

Originally, Eldatha was the sole deity who could resurrect a mortal after The Reaper had claimed them. However, after the sundering of Death's scythe, this power was extended to almost every other deity under the stars. With her primary domain no longer necessary, she refocused herself as a patron of healers, and those who prevent the pain of death.

Eventually, she became identified as the faithful bride of the young solar deity, Pelor. 

###***Domain***

Healing, Mercy, Physicians, Resurrection, Snakes and Freshwater Springs.  


###***Tenets***

The common folk regard Eldatha is a guardian spirit of the Earth that ascended to become the bride of Pelor. Eldatha’s worship predates the Church of the Light by at least a millennia; modern worship of Eldatha is likely an amalgamation of several pre-modern traditions that were incorporated as The Church spread. Eldatha’s tenets may vary considerably between locales, depending upon the social mores of the area.

Eldatha is a very popular deity that is “casually worshiped” by much of humankind. She is the patron deity of doctors and healers. Any who are afflicted with illness, or concerned for the health of another, may come to her temple to offer something in return for Eldatha’s blessings.



- Honor The Light, and worship only The Flesh of The Light.
- Hatred, dishonesty and greed are corruptions of the soul. They are to be purged with kindness, integrity and humility.
- Hold the compassion of Our Lady close to your heart. Seek her blessing by granting your aid to others.
Hold the door to your home open to those who are in need.
- Remember that Eldatha ministers to the soul of the ill as well as the body.
- Disease and injury are the curse of one who would harm a physician of Eldatha during administration of The Lady’s healing.

###***Dogma***

The Holy Order of Physicians are priests of Eldatha who have graduated from a lengthy and rigorous apprenticeship in the arts of healing. The Dogma of Eldatha is a closely observed code of conduct that every Physician must swear to at the beginning and at the completion of their apprenticeship. Upon reaffirmation of their oath, and completion of their apprenticeship, a Physician is granted an amulet depicting Eldatha’s sacred Hawthorn staff. Eldatha’s Physician-priests commonly practice alchemy, herbalism, surgery and whatever other arts may lend themselves to healing the suffering of mortalkind.

- First, in all dealings, a Physician must either help the affliction of their patients, or do nothing which may harm the patient.
- The bond between a patient and a Physician is a holy matter. A Physician must hold all secrets told by their patient to be sacred mysteries. A Physician will only speak such mysteries to other Physicians as needed for the healing of their patient, or to their apprentice, as needed for instruction.
- Blades are a tool of treatment that are not to be used lightly. 
- If a patient does not will to be treated, then the will of the patient must be respected. If the mind of a patient is unsound, and yet their kin demand treatment, then the Physician may meditate upon the matter. With the consent the patient’s kin, and a second Physician’s opinion, a Physician may cautiously treat without consent of the patient only until the patient’s mind is once again sound.
- A Physician will use their knowledge to treat the sick and injured to the best of their ability and judgement. A Physician must never use their knowledge to do wrong or harm upon anyone.
- The body of a patient is sacred, and to be regarded with the respect that the house of Our Lady is given. 
- A Physician must never withhold the healing arts from someone in mortal need. A Physician must accept whatever alms that the patient is able to provide, and trust that Eldatha will provide the rest.
- When a Physician enters the house of a patient, they enter under the specific protection of Lady Eldatha. A Physician may only enter a patient’s home to heal. If a Physician invokes Eldatha’s name to gain entrance with the intention of causing harm, despoiling goods or otherwise taking advantage of those who have trusted in Our Lady’s name, her protection is thus revoked.
- A Physician must not administer a poison with the intention of causing death. Never should the physician suggest such poison as a course of action. It is not the place of a Physician to ensure death. The exception to this is when poison may become necessary to save the life of a woman at the expense of her child.
- A Physician must never suggest contact with infernal power as a course of action to achieve healing. 
- A Physician who has been made wealthy by their trade must share in that wealth with their fellows.
- A Physician can never repay the debt that they owe to their teacher in the healing arts; they must regard their teacher with the respect and deference that is reserved for blood relatives. Those who are made kin by the trade of healing must never turn each other away in their time of need.


It is widely believed that someone who harms a Physician of Eldatha will bring ill fortune, sickness and injury upon their household. Physicians of Eldatha are afforded a great degree of trust, respect and fear within their own community. Most Physicians guard this trust very zealously; any abuse of that trust is an affront to their own personal honor as well as an affront to Eldatha’s honor. A Physician who violates the strict code of conduct may quickly find themself being “corrected” by other members of the order.

###***Allies of the Faith***

Eldatha is the wife of Pelor, and the “Fourth Ray of the Holy Sun”. She is closely allied with the other members of The Church of the Light. 

***[Pelor, Lord of the Sun and Sky -](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9sqa94/pelor_lord_of_the_sun_and_sky/)*** Pelor is Eldatha’s beloved husband. The nature of their relationship is left up to the interpretation of local mores, but all sources agree that it is a happy and productive union. Eldatha either defers to Pelor’s paternalistic authority, or she does not care to take a hand at leadership, because her concerns are elsewhere. Either way, the worship of Pelor and the worship of Eldatha are fairly intrinsically entwined. Together, they are the embodiment of an ideal household. 

***Aurora, Lady of Rainbows -*** Aurora is the daughter of Pelor and Eldatha; she is the Lady of Rainbows and the Light of Hope. Aurora is also the Guardian of Children, and she is the one who escorts the spirits of children into a peaceful afterlife. Aurora and Eldatha share a large overlap of their domains; however, Aurora is sometimes regarded as a deity of death. Aurora’s priests are not above making suggestions of quantities of toxic plants that a terminal patient may ingest in order to bring about the end of pain. This is a small point of contention between Eldatha’s priests and Aurora’s.


***[Nuada, Light of the Elves -](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9twj0l/prince_nuada_aergethlam_light_of_the_elves/)*** Nuada is the Light of the Elves, and the watchful guardian of the Elven Afterlife. Prince Nuada has an extensive knowledge of herblore and alchemy that he learned at the feet of his grandmother. Priests of Eldatha that operate within Elven lands are also said to be under Prince Nuada’s watchful protection.

***[Ilmater, The Patient Lord -](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a0kewz/ilmater_the_patient_lord/)*** Besides Pelor, Ilmater is Eldatha’s closest ally. Ilmater’s priests are frequent patients for the priests of Eldatha. Although Ilmater demands that his priests eschew divine healing for their wounds, he does not forbid them from recieving naturally-made medicines, or healing surgeries. Temples of Ilmater will often host a resident Physician, and a apprentices who need frequent practice of their arts.

***[Helios, The Light of the Law -](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/aa6t1k/helios_light_of_the_law/)*** Helios and Eldatha are only the loosest of allies. Although they maintain a cool relationship that is only held together by Pelor and Ilmater’s guidance. Helios is uncompromising, and unwilling to overlook the indiscretions of mortals. Meanwhile, Eldatha is adamant that her physicians hold their tongues and seal their senses if they witness evidence of criminal acts performed by their patients. This is a point of contention between the two deities that is unlikely to ever be resolved. Because of this contention, Eldatha’s physicians are reluctant to lend their skills towards the devout of Helios, unless absolutely necessary. 

Outside of the Church of the Light, Eldatha is still fairly widely worshipped. She is an ancient deity, and may have extensive associations that predate her marriage to Pelor. In many places, she is heavily associated with healing springs, and whatever deities that the locals may have invested in those springs. Among the Elves, Eldatha has a few small fertility cults, due to her relationship to Queen Tatiana (the Titan of Life in my setting) and Prince Nuada.

###***Enemies of the Faith***

Eldatha considers The Grim Reaper (a Titan in my setting) to be her chief enemy. Eldatha hates any and all who would worship the concept of Death, or those who practice necromancy. Raising the dead, and puppeting corpses about in a facsimile of life, is a grave offense to her. Note that this enmity does not necessarily extend towards The Raven Queen, who is merely a judge of The Dead, not a bringer of Death. 

Like every member of the Pantheon of Light, Eldatha is no fan of Asmodeus and the other infernal Lords of Baator. Her chief issue with the Infernal Lords is that they tempt the desperate, and take advantage of the fragility of mortals.

###***Clergy and Temples***

The Physicians of Eldatha have already been thoroughly discussed in the “Dogma” section. They are, by far, the most numerous of Eldatha’s clergy.

Eldatha’s temples are houses of healing. There is very little resemblance to a traditional temple, other than the presence of a shrine where supplicants may make offerings in return for healing. Where climate allows, snakes are given the run of Eldatha’s temples; they are creatures heavily associated with Eldatha’s healing power. As a bonus, the snakes seem to be quite capable of keeping rats and other pests out of the herb gardens.

Eldatha is heavily associated with natural springs; her temples are usually built around or near them. The primary purpose of a dedicated Temple of Eldatha is to treat the ill, and to educate apprentice Physicians. 

There are “sickhouse barracks” where the ill and injured may rest, and be tended by Physicians. In very large cities, these barracks are large and sprawling; reflective of times when epidemics have swept across the city, and the extra beds were needed. 

There is usually a library, located very closely to an apothecarium where healing potions and salves are mixed. At a very large or important temple, the library may be quite extensive. 


Most dedicated temples have a mortuary, where unclaimed corpses are solemnly dissected, analyzed and studied by Physicians and their apprentices. After a corpse has completely examined and studied by all of the resident doctors and apprentices, it is burned with ceremony, and interred among the ashes of Physicians and other patrons of the temple.

All temples of Eldatha have an extensive garden, where healing herbs and fungi are cultivated. 



###***Holidays and Festivals***

Eldatha is celebrated in the springtime. This is reminiscent of her origin as a handmaid of Queen Tatiana; a powerful, primal spirit of fertility. The return of life to the earth in springtime is highly symbolic of the moment when an ill patient has finally begun to recover from the depths of their illness. Additionally, with the warming of the ground, Physicians may begin cultivating their gardens and restoring their stockpiles of healing herbs. The beginning of Spring is a sigh of relief for beleaguered doctors who have labored during the winter to keep their patients well. 


The First Day of Spring is a day when Physicians give thanks to Eldatha for the survival of their patients. It is also a day when many recovered patients come forth to offer thanks to the Physicians who have ministered to them over the course of the previous year. Gifts of liquor, seeds, eggs, fattened young animals, and gold are traditionally offered to the resident Physicians at Eldatha’s temples.

Physicians are mandated to graciously accept any offerings that their patients may provide. As the sun sets on the first day of Spring, most Physicians will share their offerings with one another and celebrate generously together. 

###***Champions and Avatars***

Eldatha’s messengers are specifically said to be serpents. Eldatha’s Solar is a large cobra-like couatl named Paean (pay-yan). Paean is said to be capable of curing any affliction with the venom of his fangs.

The greatest mortal champion of Eldatha is, or was, a half-elf named Telial.

Telial Half-Elven was a Physician who took it upon himself to find the broken pieces of Eldatha’s staff, and return the power of resurrection to His Lady. He assembled a virtuous cadre of companions, and set out to hunt the lich responsible for the staff’s sundering. Telial would die with his quest unfinished, thanks to a Curse of Doom inflicted by the necromancer. However, Telial’s companions would later avenge his death, assemble the completed staff and present it, in Telial’s name, to Eldatha.

Telial’s ghost now wanders the world, with Eldatha’s Hawthorn staff in-hand, and grants second chances to those who have died with their quests unfinished.


###***Known Sects and Cults***

Usually, when a Physician is stripped of their rank and status, they quietly retire, or they seek out some other trade. However, occasionally, a heretical physician will skip town and hold themself as a true Physician. 

Although Eldatha was originally regarded as a Goddess of Resurrection, it is generally against current teachings for a Physician to attempt to resurrect a patient after they have died (the only exception to this is when The Hawthorn Staff is properly involved). 

Sometimes, a heretical Physician will stray too close to necromancy, and will be summarily stripped of their status, and shamed within the community of Physicians. Other times, a Physician who assists in torture, or unnecessary surgery may also be stripped of their status. Such physicians will frequently gravitate towards other communities, or deities, that welcome their “alternative medical solutions”.

Most actual Physicians regard heretical physicians as lower than beasts; they are traitors to the sacred code of conduct, and dangerous to the community at large. It is an unspoken rule among Physicians that “curing” a community of a heretical physician is a way to prevent harm to future patients.",1,Eldatha - The Great Physician
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,32,103,"**The Spell, The Legend**
Not just a 1st lvl druid spell (though it is, in truth, a first level spell for druids. And some rangers too. Possibly bards, of course. Maybe clerics of certain domains? Possibly warlocks pending on patron? Anyway, great spell. Let's look:

*Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.*

That's it! Sounds like a manual version of *Cure Wounds*, doesn't it? What's the big deal?

**To Stabilize is Good, But To Return To Combat... Divine!**
Thanks to certain [Crawfordian Tweeterings](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2015/08/10/goodberry-on-dying-pc/) any creature can administer this. What options exist you ask? Read on - if you must know!

- Other party members can force feed a near-dead comrade (those of *zero hit point* variety) as an action. Stabilizes (no more *death saves* required) and revitalizes (full combat ability restored). If this 1 hp. creature is hit again (for less than their h.p. total), just rinse &amp; repeat berry process. Action redux. Simple.

- [Everyone's A Winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GkwIRbLw8). Familiars now have a job other than [help action](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/86440/can-a-familiar-use-a-help-action-to-grant-advantage-on-an-attack-to-a-near-by-al). Can someone donate a berry and stay invisible? No idea. Put a berry in your mouth and hope it 'pops' as you fall down? Possibly? Can you have a hireling just add berries at key times? Why... not? A [pet dog](http://saintbernardkeg.com) bought from a merchant giving *Berry Goodness* to you? Your [paladin mount](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/99903/how-does-a-mount-from-find-steed-act-when-unmounted) helps out maybe? *Mileage may vary / talk to your local DM.*

- *Clever rogue trap!* Just like a [spy death-pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_pill) but for the side of Good! Your DM may require you to remove a real tooth (or play a barbarian) for this device to rest in your face. This *Pop A Berry* trick only works if you regain consciousness, sure - but it does put you [back in action](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318155/). Optionally you could have your local rogue / gnome / omgadgetsperson build it as a very small trap-tooth-device that opens up whenever you go from vertical to horizontal position. Or you could enchant your mock-tooth to have a *Magic Mouth* when you hit zero hit points ('talks' inside your face / *Goodberry* goodness released). Once again: *Mileage may vary / talk to your local DM*. That said, who could resist a *Magic Mouth Mock Molar*?

**But Wait There's More!**
*You idiots! An army runs on its stomach. We will need to get this stuff in cans!* - [Possibly Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon)

Many creatures struggle with food supply. Mr. di Bonaparte discovered supply shortages causes riots witin 48 hours and crushes army morale much faster. D&amp;D offers insight: monstrous food habits are often discussed in great detail in 5e. Consider ancient dragons the size of an airplane hanger: that food has got to come from somewhere. Or, in this case, it could come from a single berry. Plot points:

- Hill giants are written as evil *mostly because they are always hungry* (as well as being more than a little bit stupid). Imagine one druid apprentice - or better yet, one Hill giant druid apprentice. Having three (3) first level spells a day, one such Hill giant would easily feed &amp; lead 30 such kin. Options? Serve as an effective mercenary army, participate as wall breakers in a siege, get respectable jobs as lumberjacks (or any construction trade) - eventually accumulate wealth so as to purchase *chain barding* &amp;/or *massive greatswords*... and more, so much more! This apprentice druid need not ever level up: he or she would easily command the entire clan. That is, until another giant gained 'apprentice druid' / level one.

- Humans (*variant*) gain a feat. Choosing *Magic Initiate (druid)* still gives you ten (10) berries a day (&amp; 2 cantrips), enough for a reasonably sized Medieval family. Not fearing starvation does not leave the group moribund to a farm, orchard &amp;/or chronic location-foraging. What's more, vast resources can be focused on gaining skills, education &amp;/or accumulation of wealth.

- Druid Circles can care for their following of any number or size with any mobility - with *no impact on nature*. Gigantic loyal support groups (*great bears, bullettes, wyverns or even purple worms) - all cost a single berry a day. That said, small creatures (sentient rabbits, tiny faye, gnomes, swarms of beasties, sentient shrubs) are probably better served by foraging than needing thousands of enchanted fruit.

- Evil creatures with *Goodberry* have control over who survives or perishes in harsh climates: extreme north, vast deserts or unyielding rock shields or whatever misery your fantasy world has in store. Ideal for secure prisons, slave dominance &amp;/or mining colonies. Many Underdark realms probably survive off of this spell... or *Food &amp; Water*. Without magic they would get so sick of [canned soup](https://www.campbellsoup.ca/product/campbells-condensed-cream-of-mushroom/).

- As it is not specified a [berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry) can be nearly any single fruit fitting the definition. Yet more odd: [a watermelon is a berry, sure, but not a 'strawberry'](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/foodbeast/just-in-strawberries-are_b_3962931.html). This means your *Goodberry* can have a lot of variety and substance.

- Important point to remember: According to Lord Crawford: [you can only eat one berry at a time](https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/697533418813272065?lang=en). Thus drinking *Goodberry* juice is problematic [no matter the original berry size](https://www.supercall.com/how-to/how-much-juice-squeeze-from-fruit) - but you could quaff over eight cups of *GoodWaterMelonBerry* as a move-action. Surreally then, if you want to avoid being swallowed by a *Purple worm*, be sure you are carrying two of these enchanted fruit and RaW (Rules as Written) will not let you in. Bounce, baby! Take that, Crawfordians. Can a *hydra* or a *gibbering mouther* eat more than one such berry per mouth? Quick, someone tweet Our Master!

I would go on and explain the weird repercussions of planting such a berry where 24 hours does not pass / creatures do not age. What if you allow the seed to grow? *Goodberry Bush*? What if it is a hybrid this with one of the *Gulthias* plants? What if you *Awaken* any of these things? I can write sixteen adventures on this alone but, alas... the next post calls me. I must go to my literal non-people!

So there was [**This Post**](http://aiweirdness.com/post/180174234602/a-neural-network-will-write-your-dd-character-bio) that I saw on another dnd subreddit, about this girl who used a bot to create character backstories. And I decided to write down the cool bits and bobbles from all that. Here they are:

* The Crew of the Constant
* she came upon her pouch of sorts of most githzerai
* he was a wizard, and explained that he was in a small town of stars. 
* the grandfather was a good wizard and the daughter of the road and defended the city of the underdark
* and his mother had been a rat in the darkness
* order of the exiled in the valley with the gods
* there was the prince of the sun. he was raised by the arcane arts and accepted him to become a fire work 
* her parents realized that the sea is a noble elf animal
* he was an important machine and close to the surface
* the wings are a family of death
* violent predator rabbit demons

This sounds like a rival adventuring party. So let's go ahead and meet--

------------------------------------------------

The Wings, the crew of the Constant
--
Individual adventurers made into a family through death and left to man the Sea Machine, known as the Constant. It's an Elf Noble that was chained and restrained into the hull of a ship. They must keep it fed and breathing to stay alive. That is why the ship is known as the Constant, because they must stay in constant motion and maintain constant vigilance. 

She Who Has No Name
---
Has no special abilities, but has a pouch of Gith magic and sorcery. When the pouch is opened, it immediately casts invisibility, shield, and mage hand. She can not control this. 

He Who Lost His Name to Time
--
Born in the astral plane, among many stars. He can harness their power. He is an archer and, at will, can fire an arrow up into the sun to ""turn it off"". This is magical darkness. The only way he is able to see through it himself is because of his 5 sun-arrows (act as a lightning bolt spell). 
Oldman 
--
Defender of the Underdark, daughter of the road. A wizard of unmatched power. He can turn himself into 3 Svirfneblin (use MM statblock). When they drop to 0hp he returns to his normal form.
Mother
--
A rat, just a normal rat. She can see in magical darkness and her bite is poisoned. 
Prince of the Sun
--
A living fireball spell. He can cast himself, reforming the next round. He can do this 1/day. Other wise he is a knight (use the MM statblock). 

Crew
--
The rest of the ship is run by violent, predator, rabbit demons. They are white furred and red-eyed and can turn into normal bunnies at will. But usually they are a strange human/rabbit/demon hybrid that have 120' movement, immunity to fire, and 3 vicious bite attacks a turn. 

---------------------------------------

Where Are They?
--
The Constant is found on the sea at all times, always moving. The Wings are often out and about, trying to find ways to rid themselves of the burden of their ship. So, how it works is, the party runs into one of the Wings, has an encounter, then will run into two of them together, then three, and this weird ""family"" keeps building out and revealing all their weird abilities and quirks. 

So roll here to see who you run into:

So it's a new year and I've got a lot planned. Firstly is to try and blog every day. To do that, I can't always post on BTS because there are some things this place is not suited for. So if you want to follow those blogs, [here's my blogspot](https://insidethegiantseye.blogspot.com/). There's a backlog of some older stuff. I've mainly used it as a place to store some ideas. But that's soon going to change. 

I reached 300 followers on reddit! Which feels like something. Though I'm not sure what. 

I've sold a few books. Self-publishing is still a bitch. Learning how to formate a PDF to print specifications is taking longer than I thought. But I should have TWO books ready to go in a few weeks. That's right. I wrote TWO books. Haunted and Inside the Giant's Eye. Both of them are adventures, both are completely drawn and laid out by me. 

If you want to support me, [buy Haunted](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258940/Haunted) and tell me if it was useful or not. In the meantime--

Good luck, don't die. ",1,Here's a Rival Adventuring Party for New Years : )
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,461,"**The Classic Golem**

Since 1st Edition D&amp;D has had the Big Four golems: Clay, Flesh, Stone &amp; Iron. They stand as human males, typically from 7' to 10' tall or so. They carry no markings, armour, magic items or even [clever vandalism](https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-vandalism-street-art/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic). 

*Sample Golem Encounter*
DM: ""You see a statue of a guy made of some white stone. He is just standing there, not on a horse, has no sword or shield. It does not have any caption... nor even a dias or stand for that matter.""

PC1: ""For love of Vecna, another *Stone Golem*. Anyone have *Stone to Flesh*?""

PC2: ""Looks like we lost that spell somewhere after v.3.5. Anyone have magic items??""

PC1: ""No. Jeremy Crawford &amp; Mike Mearls took all of those from us in late 2014! Doom for us all then.""

PC2: ""Let us hope this damn thing cannot climb walls.""

*Don't let this be YOU, fellow DMs. Here are tips to make your even your stone golems rock - and your iron golems downright metal!*

**Variants in Shape, Place &amp; Style**

*Golems need not be 'men'.* Consider that the *Flesh Golem* is modelled after the monster created by the eminent [Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Frankenstein), a brilliant Swiss guy that should have stuck to making watches and pocket knives. He did not have *Mending*, let alone the amazing repertoire of other flesh shaping spells. If you want you can make it a stunningly pretty elf that pounds men into dust. Give her [Lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com/) outfits. Just fabulous.

*You can make any animal. Or thing.* If you make any mount shape - be that horse, dog, cat, praying mantis or [anything else you might ride](https://www.warcraftmounts.com). The thing won't fly but you can add wings if you want. You could even have a dragon that flies as good as a [Led Zeppelin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9ioyEvdggk). Or imagine your key villain riding in on an [Iron Clydesdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clydesdale_horse). Players, genuflect.

*Dress them up &amp; take them out.* If you assume armour proficiency, you can put anything on them. Logically useless for *Iron* perhaps - but for *Flesh* and *Clay*, this kind of barding would make a huge difference. You can give ANY golem a shield and +2 armour class. If you want you can go with optional rules and give them a gargantuan tower shield or scutum, granting them 90% cover.
Ends with bracket // forget how to embed this flaxing thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutum_(shield)

*Decorate your machine.* [Tattoos](https://improb.com/best-tattoo-ideas-for-men/), especially for flesh golems. [Stone etchings](https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/concrete_engraving/) on stone golems. Porcelain parts on clay golems. Ironic slogans on iron golems. Paint them. Give them a hat. A [fig leaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_leaf) for goodness sake. You can make your flesh golem patchwork from many races or ethnicities. Your stone golem can be granite, marble or even glass. Your iron golem can be a number of amazing alloys and gem encrusted. Your clay golem is squishy so it could include bricks, rubber tires, a coke bottle or that sock you couldn't find yesterday.

*Dramatic non-entrance is still dramatic.* If you want you can have them with a dias, stand, archway, alcove or holding dramatic items. If you have a female stone golem, give her robes, give her a blindfold, sword (one hand) and a balance (the other). Get beaten down by [Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice)! For that matter, why not use any position used by any [famous statue around our world](https://10mosttoday.com/10-most-famous-statues-in-the-world/)? Put a few *Magic Mouths* on the thing and have it make fun of players as it fights.

Player 1: 'We got our butts handed to us by the [Statue of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty)... just the last dungeon!'

Player 2: 'That's nothing. We got whupped by Rodin's [Thinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker). We didn't even have time to react!'

*Situationally strategic statues.* Have it trigger any kind of trap, situation or problem. This can be anything like beating a massive gong &amp;/or drum to warn allies. Perhaps have it [pull the lever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfIxMNm7roU). Imagine a magnificent stone statue holding up a [massive stone world-globe](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html): when it has to fight it [drops the world on you, Indiana style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvy2tRH7HNE). 

*Use your elements.* A flesh golem is repaired by electricity. Those cowardly *Will o' Wisps* can heal! Give your iron golem a tower shield with a permanent *Wall of Fire* on it. Clay golem as 'abandoned statue' / best Black dragon vomit-target or [spittoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spittoon) (Black dragon: *""its called a 'breath weapon', okay?""*). In fact, Blue, Black &amp;/or Red dragons would use their golems as ground-strategic whilst providing air-tactical. Best. Treasure. Ever.

**Buff that fabulous creation with [magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_1QSUsbsM): Brief list of magic items that make golems harder to beat:**

- *Saddle of the Cavalier* If your golem is man-shaped, use this as a shoulder-pad and put a skeleton on it. Disadvantage for attacking the golem. 

- *Headband of Intellect* Imagine your stupid automaton is actually a *genius*. Bonus points for giving it traps, terrain, allies, undead &amp; other devices to give it boss-level control of your dungeon / terrain.

- *Hat of Disguise* Your Flesh golem could look like anyone. Handy if this thing is the local bouncer at your bar.

- *Gloves of Swimming and Climbing* Adds a new dimension of terror. Bonus points for combining this with *Ring of Feather Fall* and having it get the drop on players. Get the drop! Ha-larious.

**A Few Adventure Ideas:**

- Put an *animated skeleton* or *zombie* inside of *animated armour* and equipped with two *animated swords* (rapiers). Give the armour a device or mild enchantment so it does not fall down when it 'dies'. Characters will struggle knowing when to target the (un)dead body // the armour // &amp;/or // the weapons it uses.

- Put a *shield guardian* with two *feather fall* spells in it (or any golem with two *Feather Fall* devices... can a golem drink a potion?). At a key time in combat this golem triggers the entire floor around it to collapse, causing all those unprepared to fall to the stone floor below. Once this new 'floor' the golem runs through a door to another room with yet another wooden floor. There it causes this latest floor to collapse again, causing the party to fall yet again. Make your PCs the fall guys. Do it *after summer* if you like.

- Placing nearly any ooze inside of a clay golem, excellent source of regeneration for the automaton. What's more, clay golems are squishy, that is, able to squeeze through tight holes and reform in their original shape on the other side.

- *Flesh golems* can work with *Will o' Wisps* symbiotically, similar to the *clay golem* and *oozes*, above. Flesh golems in metal armour can be vulnerable to some electrical 'damage', thereby doubling their self-repair process. This armour could be enchanted as 'cursed' so as to superconduct this energy.

- *Rugs of smothering* are ideal for covering narrow pits that funnel into tight spaces or trap doors that open to narrow tunnels. The carpet can then follow the party as they climb into this quasi-confinement (unable to support one another *en masse*) and surprise whomever is in the rear-guard. 

- [Dive! Dive! Auuuga!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF8JKkRo5fk) - Grapple &amp; swim with any target. It is not clear if Flesh golems breathe but the rest are good inside any liquid. Clay golems swim amazingly well (read: 'walk on bottom') in acid pools. Bonus points for dumping the entire PC group in a *gelatinous cube* with Stone or Clay golems (once again, Clay regenerates in this situation). 

- *Throw stuff* An Iron golem with parts that accommodate catapult or trebuchet components can be amazing. Given fire-based shot it heals as it launches hell from above.

- *Campaign on Rails* Any golem would do, but an *Iron Horse* pulling a few cars on rails could give your campaign in a [steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) feel.

",1,"Golems of Different Shapes, Sizes &amp; Colour"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,18,150,"So I like to have some sort of game mechanic built into my plots that give D&amp;D a bit of a twist. For my last campaign I wanted to explore the idea of a party that lost their memories in the midst of accomplishing an important task. My goal was to see if I could get the feeling of remembering into the game in a way that translated to character discovery being a central part of the fun. I also wanted this mechanism to provide a pathway to deeply embed the characters into the story and world.

Here's how I went about it:

1. We established early on that memory loss was a part of the central story. We also established for role playing purposes that memory loss meant long term memory loss but not what their name was or class. Characters could recognize races, monsters, what a tree was- but not historic or personal history. I'n effect they were starting as lvl 1 characters who had been virtually knocked down the ladder from thier previous selves after the memory loss. Race traits also help players have a character that is more grounded and has some personality (i.e a Tabaxi that is naturally drawn to shinies , a gnome innately is drawn to the underground).

2. Players were to come into the game with no backstory but rather intuitions. Since they were starting from memory loss I wanted to give them a seed to start with that would begin the journey of discovering the complexities of their characters along side their characters remembering. They got to choose this intuition but it had to be vague (i.e.- I feel drawn to darkness or I remember fire everywhere), if it was a place or person it could only be one word. I got to decide what this intuition meant and when it would be revealed I'm the game.

3. We established that per level players each gained a memory. Either by me feeding them plot through a memory or them taking a prompt like ""you remember your mother"" to spin a tale at the table and learn about who they are etc. This is in addition to what they learn through exploring the world and talking with NPCs.

From here the game is about unraveling the plot knot you create along with pursuing leads on players. Remember this isn't the game, the plot is built around these things and makes sense of how it came be for your characters.

2018 marked a real turning point in our little subreddit. There are over 170,000 of us now, and the sub has had a hell of a year!

We have a brand new mod team, and they are doing an absolutely amazing job, really impressed with the passion and dedication, and I am grateful as hell.

We ran events every month, culminating in a crowdsourced City that will be available to the community as soon as we collate the data and put it into a pdf.

We ran 24 AMAs, from DMs both new and experienced, and they will continue into 2019 (and indeed, we have DMs scheduled until 2022!), so thanks to everyone for participating and asking great questions!

Next year we are going to see more events, more ways for you to get what you need, and more crowdsourced activities. The subreddit birthday is on February 5th (4 years!) and I hope you will all join us to celebrate our humble home.

Thanks to all of YOU for being here, for sharing your content, for being a great, amazing, friendly, toxic-free community and for making BTS the best it can be. Really proud of all of you and I hope you stick around for another great year!

Have a great holiday and stay safe!

",1,2018 - A Look Back and What 2019 Brings
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,74,"**The space:** 

A downward ramp leads to a small ,roughly, dimond shaped room. 

Ankle deep water fills the room with corpses of various ages and stages of decomposition fouling up the water.

On the far side of the room is another tunnel that leads back upward.

Two of the corpses appear to have equipment.

**Effects:**

* Poison Gas: The room is filled with a scentless, heavier than air gas.
   * Any flame that requires air will dim over one round then go out .
   * Characters must make a DC 14 Constitution save or become poisoned for 1 hour. This save must be made every round they remain in the room.
      * on a failure the character also begins to suffocate until they get out of the room.
      * Holding ones breath before entering the room negates the need to make a save. (Can't make verbal components of spells while holding your breath)
* Darkness: the room is pitch black and has no source of light.

**The Challenge:** several *peircers* (MM pg. 252)

when entering the room several peircers will drop from above to make an attack against the characters. falling from 10ft up dealing (1d6) damage (1d4-1, minimum 1) peircers will fall each round for 3 rounds.

**Purpose**

This room is meant to be a trap by its self that challenges low constitution score characters in one way, and low AC characters in another, with numerous ways of dealing with any part of the trap.

It also adds the potential poisoned debuff for the next encounter making it harder or giving resources uses to clear it.

The torches and lanterns going out also means that any darkvision less characters are attacked at advantage by peircers, and even darkvision characters rushing through this room will have disadvantage on perception checks for what lies in the next room, as well as investigation checks to search the bodies for loot.

Faster characters are also rewarded with less risk to themselves from the room, but it could lead to a party split.

**Rewards**

The gear/valuables from two corpses.

I would recommend a consumable item or 2, (potion, anti-venom, low level spell scroll) a small amount of gold, and a took kit of some kind (leaning heavily toward climbers or miners tools) and maybe some starting gear (weapons, armor, ammo/rations).

Ask how many turns the player wants to search the body for to determine the DC. Reduce the DC by 5 per turn. Disadvantage for low light (or relying on darkvision)

*Particularly strong PCs (Strength 18+) can just take the body and everything it's carrying automatically for searching in a safer location if they choose.*

DC 10 for 1 turn

DC 5 for turn 2

Auto success + roll for 3 turns

Auto super success + roll on 4 turns

* Fail: you find the coin purse and pocket it
* Success: you assess that they have Artisans tools with them and manage to collect the entire kit. In addition to the above.
* Success+5: you manage to spot a (consumable) tucked into a secret pocket in addition to the above.
* Success+10: list all gear they were carrying and let player take it restriction on armor only (light armor if only 1 turn, medium armor if 2 turns, heavy requires 5 turns... Doff times assume the wearer is having the gear removed safely, this is pulling gear off a rotting/ fragile corpse)

**Rules to be aware of**

Suffocating and breath holding

Peircers inability to attack in any way other than falling (no melee attacks, no opportunity attacks)

**Difficulty**

Changing the shape of the room is the most direct way of adjusting the difficulty. A longer distance between entrance and exit means more time for poison and suffocation to come into  effect.

Likewise changing the height of the ceiling adds more damage to the peircers attacks, Adding (1d6) per 10 ft of height. (Up to 6d6).

Making the floor an inverted cone or bowl shape  with slippery sides could add it's own challenges as it groups the PCs in the middle and requires them to climb out (either with a climbing speed or rolls) or use some other form of mobility to bypass the slippery floor.

&amp;#x200B;

The Above encounter is easily tied into  my previous encounter **A hot meal** [https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a6z5ip/steal\_this\_encounter\_a\_hot\_meal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a6z5ip/steal_this_encounter_a_hot_meal/) by simply having the rooms be connected. the fires from the previous room burnt away most of the breathable air.

**0. About Dark Druids and Lifelines**

*Dark Druids*

Where Druids have made it their duty to keep the balance of nature -and by proxy life itself-, working against chaotic disturbances as well as disturbances caused by order, Dark Druids take a more radical stance in the protection of that balance. To them civilisation is a disturbance, an mark on the pure fabric of the world. Civilisation is what is keeping life out of balance, preventing nature from righting that unbalance itself.

Dark Druids are extremists, comparable to zealots of a faith, and will pursue their goal with the same fanatic intensity. While they are protectors of life, they will take drastic measures to ensure their protection second thought. To them humanoids,especially humans, have no special place in the web of life, and will be culled with the same cold ruthlessnes a forester might shoot a predator if he endagers the ecosystem.

Too much chaos, caused by magic, demons or other sources, may weaken the balance and must be stopped the same way too much order must be stopped, which may suffocate life with regulations or overexploitation. Gods and their servants fall under the latter category as they, from a Dark Druids point of view, control the wild the same way civilisation itself does.

The goal all Dark Druids work towards can be summarised as the dismantling of civilisation and the return of all races to their original place in the ecosystem, sending humans back to being hunters and foragers.

*---Intermission: a Dark Druids point of view &amp; agenda---*

Usually, though not always or guaranteed, a Dark Druid doesnt start as one. Their original intentions are pure and generally well-meaning, but as they venture out into the world, away from their secluded home with their old Druid circle, they see the exploitation of nature, the imbalance of ecosystems and the separation of advanced civilisation from nature, all of which they see as forces pushing nature further from its balance. After a while of fighting against them and not achieving enough change in their eyes, they may become disillusioned with the world or themself. Ultimately this is the tipping point, where they change their world view or goals to something more realistic or truly become a Dark Druid.

To a Dark Druid perfect balance is the point where they are no longer needed to intervene, where nature balances itself, where predator and prey counts fluctuate but dont leave a certain margin, where most life lives sustainably. As such, advanced civilisations are a direct threat, even if one may argue that their developtment should be considered part of natural developtment itself. Dark Druids see themselves as the only instance that is qualified to decide what the proper balance of life is, and as such they should be the ones that decide, how a perfect society looks like. Sentient races are just another animal species to them, and should their numbers exceed what the Dark Druids deems stable and sustainable, he will cull them relentlessly and without remorse.

To a Dark Druid, civilisation is the direct antithesis of nature and balance. While some of them may distinguish between some of the more primal civilisations and the more advanced ones, in the end everything that exceeds the status of hunters and gatherers, small groups of a race living off what their surroundings can provide, is a threat to their vision of a perfect world, and can only be tolerated, if it stays as close as possible to natures ways and is stricly led and controlled to do so, of course by a Dark Druid, who can decide what actions of said society can be balanced out by nature.

Despite all this Dark Druids are inherently opposed to a group of PCs or may not even appear to be 'evil' at first sight. They may try to persuade the players to join their side and not attack them on sight.

*---Intermission End---*

When dealing with Druidic magic normal Druids keep the same balance they use for other subjects. Dark Druids show no such restraint, diving deeper into wild magic than what could be considered safe. Influenced by the same wild energy, Dark Druids become more resilient than their more moderate counterparts, and their primal nature gives them an almost animalistic Charisma, at the cost of self control and restraint.

*Lifelines*

Lifelines, also called lines of power or leylines, are a physical manifestation of the world spirit, the symbol of the same balance that all Druids try to work towards. They span the whole world, an innumerable amount of them invisible to the naked eye. A druid trained to do so may see Lifelines and make deductions on life and its balance based on the state of the Lifeline.

Lifelines intersect, usually at points where nature is balanced and strong, like a grove or a especially old part of a forest. Sometimes those intersections have been marked by Druids with a tall monolith or a stone circle and serve as meeting points for druid circles or councils. At an intersection druidic magic flows especially strong. Druids may have advantage on rolls concerning their spells success and give disadvantage on rolls resisting them, or they may be able to cast spells using spell slots of one level lower than intended. This depends ~~on your decision as a DM~~ on the intersection and the druid in question.

**1. The Wild King**

*1.1 About Wild Kings*

At the top of all forms of Dark Druids sits the Wild King. At the end of their life or at a prior point in their life, a Dark Druid may decide that his work is not done and to accomplish his goals will undergo steps to become a Wild King, the superlative of all that constitutes a Dark Druid. There have only been two recorded appearances of a Wild King and both times they brought civilisation to the brink of collapse.

*1.2 Metamorphosis*

To become a Wild King a Dark Druid has to transform. Bedding himself in a magically prepared resting place within the ground at a Lifeline intersection, filled with mistletoe (*viscum album*), meadowsweet (*filipendula ulmaria*), watercress (*nasturtium officinale*) and various herbs and plants with magical properties, the Dark Druids pupates and sleeps within the ground for over a century. During this time he is unable to defend himself and vulnerable, so the place for his pupation must be chosen well and ideally protected by allies, traps and/or natural defenses. Such defenses may include but are not limited to: awakened trees acting as guardians, sworn fey protectors, poisonous plants and roots encircling the cocoon or wild animals under the impression that the place of pupation is their young in danger (*read* angry grizzly, crocodile or boar momma depending on location).

*1.3 Awakening*

After his transformation the Wild King emerges from his resting place. While he retains his knowlegde and abilities from before his transformation and even keeps parts of his appearance from before the transformation, this terrible butterfly is nothing like the caterpillar he started as. His skin is as thick as the hide of an old adult dragon, his flesh has the consistency of young oak and as such he is difficult to injure by physical means. His skin may take the colour of leaves, bark or stone, but also may retain its original colour. He sustains himself simply by feeding of natures life force, and as such he has no need for food, drink and, depending on your interpretation, sleep. His control over and power in wild magic is unmatched and his deep connection to nature gives him the some or all of the perks of Lifeline intersections for druids everywhere except areas almost devoid of life, such as sand, ice or debris deserts.

*1.4 Primal War*

His goal in mind the Wild King will now use his control over plants, animals and nature spirits and his charismatic influence on natureconnected humanoids to gather the forces of nature. He will try to unite them under his rule, going to war with civilisation and therefore with all races unwilling to return to a life of hunting or gathering. The two documented Wild Kings commanded vast armies, ranging from various feys to beasts and even primal societies of various humanoids, and both times they were only narrowly defeated by the combined efforts of the local cultures.

**2. The call of the Wild - Where, when and how to use the Wild King**

By now it should be obvious that a Wild King is usually a big deal, and not something a unprepared or low-leveled party should attempt to directly confront. Dark Druids and Wild Kings are not intended to be playable classes, and the long incubation of a Wild King ensures that a players doesnt simply become one while the campaign is still running. If you want to allow your players to become a Wild King or play as one, you of course can do so, but should be aware that this will be very difficult if not impossible to balance if you dont change key factors.As such the rest of this chapter focuses on using a Wild King as an antagonist, nemesis or indirect threat to the party. All of following subchapters can be used as a theme for an adventure.

*2.1 Preventing his existence*

Because of the threat a Wild King poses to almost all sentient races, Druid circles usually take heavy precautions to prevent the rise of one. Lifelines are carefully monitored by local Druids for irregularities pointing towards the metamorphosis of one, Dark Druids are fought or converted, and any resting place found will be destroyed before it can birth a Wild King. A Dark Druid has to find a way to escape the Druids notice, protect his resting place or hire/gather Allies, who will do the protecting for him.

*2.2 Stopping his rise to power*

Should those precautions fail, the next point where the Wild King can be stopped is by disrupting his progress, by gathering wildlife, fey or humanoids under your own banner before they join him. This obviously doesnt guarantee success, as your new allies may be swayed to join the Wild King regardless or may not even be convinced to join you. Another option is to wage guerilla warfare against his growing army, stopping or slowing his rise to power, buying the kingdoms and/or tribes nearby the time they need to prepare for the coming storm.

*2.3 Weathering or facing the storm*

Once the Wild King has united nature it will become difficult for players or armies to confront him directly. He is at the height of his power, easily outmatching all but the most skilled warriors and and is usually surrounded by large amounts of his followers, all dedicated to him and his cause. Birds are his eyes and ears, his most loyal followers, both beast, fey and man, are his guard, making infiltration all but impossible, countering ambush strategies for both parties and armies, while his troops, used to the wild and its paths, suffer from no such disadvantage.

Facing the Horde of the Wild King in the field, should you force him or should he decide to do so, can be dangerous at best and suicidal at worst, even when you face him with the combined forces of the surrounding nations and tribes.

*2.4 Cutting off the head of the beast*

The only way to truly stop a Wild King is to destroy him, which, while difficult, is not impossible. His abilities and physical attributes, his spells and his melee prowess make him a formidable foe even for large groups. Feel free to build upon the idea of a final confrontation, either after his armies are defeated or still roam the world. Either way, this fight will be the end of the danger he poses, should he lose, as his armies are held together by his strength of will alone and will fall apart should he fall.

*2.5 The fight*

The confrontation with a Wild King will most likely be in his grove/lair or on the battlefield, as he has no need to leave his home apart from direct conflict, should he desire it.

This post will focus on a confrontation in the lair of the Wild King as it is easier to prepare and control. Obviously this gives the Wild King the home advantage. He can use his lair actions *(TBD in a future post)* and knows his hideout inside out. Feel free to include allies of the Wild King if you want to, depending on the situation leading up to the conflict. The fighting style of a Wild King depends heavily on the personality you gave yours, the stats he has and the abilities/spells he has access to. But even while the Wild Kings strategy may range from a berserkerlike melee frenzy, tossing PCs about with enhanced strength, to a tactic spellcaster, sending summoned allies to cover him and attacking his foes from afar, one thing should remain constant.

The Wild King fights with a savage wildness, not surrendering to the mere mortals before him, not giving ground until he lies dead at your players feet. Animal/Fey/Humanoid allies fighting for their King will not surrender either while he still stands, even going against their natural instincts. Once the King has fallen they may revert to their natural behaviour and flee, depending on the species/type of enemy.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,11,151,"A resource for any DMs to use; a collection of 300+ magical items from my long running campaign.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/hd28nndcysxbn0v/Adventurer%27s%20Ordinance.pdf?dl=0


These were designed for a AD&amp;D (1e/2e) style game in mind, but 95% of them are easily portable to any edition, some may need a few tweaks due to rule changes but any DM can do that easily (I even included some conversion notes for those not familiar with the older rules).

On thing I really miss from the new games is the unique flair that the older games had. The newer (3e/5e.. yes I still consider 3e a newer edition) games are streamlined, but they also became a bit more... generic in the process. While some survived, and sometimes just names are the same, many items lost of lot of their... quirks... and became more generic number blocks (e.g. Weapon of X, Potion of ""Spell""). Where is the potion of giant control, ring of warmth, or the Hammer of Thunderbolts (which when combined with the Girdle of Giant Strength and Gauntlets of Ogre Power (Thor's three magic items: Mjölnir, Megingjörð , and Járngreipr) becomes super-powered).

This list is more in the old school spirit of quirky items. Some are awesome and useful, some are silly and fun, some require a player to make a risk/reward gamble, and some are just plain-old cursed items to run away from. Some may not jive with 5e, but most should be perfectly fine.

Anyway, long story short: Enjoy and hopefully someone finds something useful!",1,322 New Magical Items to Spice up your Campaign
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,109,1042,"I played Undertale just last year and it has affected the way I look at NPCs more than any other inspiration. It was part of the reason behind *my* NPC formula (what they say, what they don't say, what they actively hide), and it's changed the way I look at villains, shopkeepers, and all the NPCs I hope the party wants to keep around. 

Here's how--

1. All encounters are social encounters
---

* In Undertale you can be a pacifist. You can go the entire game without killing any of the monsters. 
* This is accomplished by giving each monster some kind of emotional hook that, if you are clever enough or big enough to take the hits, you can uncover. 
* If you take this into DnD, you are left with the possibility of every encounter becoming a social encounter rather than a combat encounter. 
* The first step to this is to think of everything has having reason and purpose.
* A reason is why someone is doing something. ""I am in this dungeon to provide for my family.""
* A purpose is how badly you want to do the thing. ""I need to provide for my family because without me they would die.""
* With a reason and a purpose, even a group of goblins can become a social encounter. They're only raiding the village because they're being forced to by this dark spirit, and they listen to the dark spirit because if they don't, then the dark spirit will curse all of their children.

2. There's a thin line between Villain and Friend
---

* One of the first villains is Undyne, a glorious fish-girl made of ferocity. She provides the first major opposition to the player. At least, she's the first opposition that threatens your life.
* She's a knight of the main villain, with magical power, and amazing battle music.
* Beyond that though, she's someone who doesn't know her own strength. She has a soft spot for people weaker than her, taking on an older sister role. She has hope and so much joy that it's almost violent.
* Every ""villain"" is just an NPC that stands in the way of the Party at one particular time.
* Undertale shows this fragility through a very powerful tool: Player Choice (which we'll talk about next).
* Creating an NPC like this isn't easy or hard. There's not really a formula you can follow. But here are some tips.
* Base NPCs off of parts of yourself. The you that comes out when around strangers. The you that is active when around family. The you that is active when around people you hate. Think of all the parts of you and use them as a source.
* Base NPCs off of your friends. You've been around your friends enough to notice the little things, so keep note of them. Use your friends for inspiration when making NPCs. How would your best friend act if they were in charge of the royal army? What if your mom was an assassin? 
* Focus again on Reason and Purpose. Making these opposite or adjacent to your party's reasons and purpose will make this fragile line both visible, and tangible.

3. Player's get to choose who is a friend and who is a foe
---

* When it comes to Undyne, there's a moment when you ""beat"" her by refusing to attack her and she becomes exhausted in the heat and collapses.
* You, as the player, can let her die. You can just walk away. 
* But you can also get her some water. This is how you become a friend. It's that simple. You show mercy in the face of this horrible opposition and that leads to Undyne seeing that you are not the vile thing the BBEG has made you out to be.
* This would be meaningless if the players had to do it. But really it's hidden behind many door. The first being the RPG nature to fight every opponent. Then even if you're a pacifist it's still hidden behind this moment where you can just walk away.
* You actively make the choice the entire time. 
* Putting this kind of thing into you players' hands really gives the NPCs some weight. And sure, the villain asks for forgiveness, the party might just strike them down. But that's okay. It's their choice.

4. You can be tragic and soul crushing, if you have grace
---

* I have a very strong interesting the the depressing things in games. I like things to be hard and long and filled with harsh emotions.
* It wasn't until Undertale that I felt confident enough to push into these emotions. Because, there's some heavy shit in Undertale but it's still beautiful.
* How they do this is two fold--
* Firstly it's player choice again. If you choose to kill and fight, then there are darker things in store for you. There are characters who will die. There are characters who will turn on you. You will get an ending that is not as sweet as the others.
* Secondly, it's in the payoff. The game shows you at every step that if you care, if you're kind, that you will be rewarded. Establishing this allows you to go down a long, scary, dark road (like the research lab in Undertale), and the players will trust you
* How do you do this? It comes back to theme, which can be best established through NPCs.
* If you are playing strict 5e. By the books. RAW. Then killing monsters is HOW you get XP. The theme of the game is that you can, and will defeat your opponent with team work and the such. 
* So to establish this and reward this, create NPCs that reward and embody these ideas. Monster hunters, dragon slayers, adventure guilds. 
* Then, after this is established you can have bad things happen: monster destroys the village, dragon kidnaps an NPC, zombies rise up and cause the apocalypse. And there will be an understanding that the party can and will be able to beat these threats.

5. Secrets
---

* There are a lot of secrets in Undertale. It's why the final bit of my NPC formula is ""What they actively hide"". 
* Secrets are the crux of complex characters. It informs part of their reason and purpose. 
* It gives you something to discover about them. Something to interact with. 
* Even a simple secret like, ""Maya actively hides that she has a crush on the fighter of the party"" creates some depth and play within the group. She'll act differently to them. Get them gifts. Get flustered whenever they speak.
* A secret can also be a way to ""test"" the party, because a secret is just a question you are asking the party. ""What will you do when you learn this thing about this person?""
* What will you do when you learn that alphys has done horrible research like she's done?
* What will you do when the Guild Leader reveals that he's paid by the King you oppose? 
* What will you do when your love interest turns out to have a crush on another party member?
* Secrets are powerful. Every NPC, even the shopkeepers, should have a secret.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,16,179,"# Scenario objectives:

* Evoke Lovecraftian body horror

* Make wide reaching connections to the rest of the campaign world

# Summary:

The Black Reach was once an underwater fortress and garden home to Charybdis, an ancient aboleth and spirit of the reef that controlled the nearby seas through a hivemind of aquatic life. An arcane cataclysm thrust the volcanic seamount up above the waves, making it accessible to the terrestrial races and trapping Charybdis in the depths. The Black Reach is currently occupied by the Thay and the Drow, who now exploit the aboleth and its fortress as a prison forge to create monstrous thralls. Charybdis lays weakened in the depths of the dungeon, tormented and yearning for escape. 

This dungeon is meant for mid tier adventurers of level 5-10 but with different objectives would be appropriate for higher or lower level parties.

[google docs full writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ECJsRahsah4-32Iwu6y8kvyc9Tz3d6RzVJ0eIj4O5zU/edit?usp=sharing)

[Battlemap for VTTs](https://imgur.com/a/7xzbOMs). I pulled this off some webforum or another. It was called Cave of the Otuyugh. I don’t know where I got it but I thought the maker did a great job and so I repurposed it for this adventure. Marker notes are in the google docs writeup.

# Scenario Description:

The Black Reach is an isle of volcanic rock that juts out of the open ocean. Its perimeter of shattered stone and craggy coves conceal narrow passages and sea caves that lead deep into the island. It was once a submerged seamount that was hollowed out into a network of subterranean tunnels and underwater coral gardens by an ancient aboleth, **Charybdis**. When an arcane cataclysm hurled the Black Reach skyward, Charybdis was left trapped in its throne room, barely sustained by a trickle of seawater that seeps through the pores of the rock. In the open ocean, Charybdis was a fearsome scourge that exerted control over a reef and all its denizens. Now, weakened and isolated, it writhes with fury at the heart of the dungeon and exults in dreams of freedom and revenge.

Charybdis’ skin is covered in a vicious coral that infests other animals as a flesh mutating disease. Once contracted from the aboleth’s skin, coral polyps spread across the victim and burrow into its flesh, weakening them and causing great pain whenever the victim is not immersed in water. Over time, their bones are converted to chiton and gills form on their necks, causing them to gasp for breath (if not suffocate) in the air. Finally, their gelatinous flesh sloughs away and they are transformed into Chuul. The flesh eating coral is a combination and re-skin of the two aboleth diseases described in the 5e stat block.

**Driders of the House Arnach** discovered a passage into the Black Reach from the Underdark that was opened up by the cataclysm. Finding Charybdis in a weakened state, the Drow wizard **Vincia** realized that Charybdis was ripe for exploitation. Vincia discovered that creatures infested by this aboleth’s coral disease become more susceptible to mind control. She weaponized this by using the aboleth mucus as a fertilizer for the amanitas fungus found on the tunnel walls of the Black Reach. Creatures that eat this fungus see their mental fortitude erode and they become easier to break.

Harvesting mucus from an aboleth, even one as weakened as Charybdis, is dangerous at best. Vincia employs Thay sailors known as Thayspawn to do the dirty work of collecting the mucus and farming the amanitas. Glyphs of psychic protection are tattooed on the shaved heads of these poor souls to help dull the psychic roar of the aboleth, but their humanity does not last long in the Black Reach.

Thay mages capture beasts of all kinds and bring them to the Black Reach. There, Vincia force feeds them amanitas in order to dominate and psychically rebuild them as thralls. The thralls are then used as shock troops, gladiators, or horrific pets. A passageway deep in the Black Reach stretches on into the Underdark and is the conduit for trade with the Drow.

# Denizens of the Black Reach:

**Vincia of House Kel’ath** is the cruel Drow master of the Black Reach. She is a veteran of combat against illithids and so has expertise dealing with mind controlling tentacular abominations such as Charybdis. She has made extensive use of stoneshape magic to rebuild the Black Reach into a prison. She enjoys torturing and dominating all denizens of the Black Reach, including the beasts that the Thay bring her as well as her servants in the dungeon. The Thayspawn produce far more amanitas than she needs to mind control simple beasts, and so she sends the excess to House Kel’ath in the Underdark. Her quarters contain a psychic dampener to prevent the Charybdis from influencing her and she keeps a chain devil as a bodyguard. When threatened, Vincia’s chain devil will try to bind intruders in the narrow tunnels while Vincia uses area-of-effect spells to great impact. If she is bested she will use her wand of stoneshape to open narrow cracks between passages and escape using the spell gaseous form.

The **Thayspawn** are the expendable thralls of the prison who do all work related to Charybdis and the amanitas. They are, or were, human sailors and captives who were bribed, tricked or pressed into service in this dark place. All but the freshest Thayspawn are without humanity, minds broken by either Vincia or Charybdis. Their scalps are covered with silvery runic tattoos that offer some measure of protection against the waves of psychic assault by the aboleth, but this comes at a terrible price of psychic isolation. Thayspawn exist in a twilight world where they cannot sense other creatures around them, perceiving only dim outlines of the creatures that surround them. Groups of Thayspawn work together to tend the amanitas garden and harvest the aboleth’s ichor without being aware of one another. They go about their business paying no attention to the party, though if they are attacked they will fight back with reckless abandon. Injury accelerates the transformation of a Thayspawn into a Chuul.

Inevitably, Thayspawn succumb to the aboleth’s parasites and mutate into Chuul, horrifying and brutal lobstrosities. Ordinarily, Chuul become part of the aboleth controlled hive mind, giving them purpose and order. However, the psychic isolation caused by Thayspawn’s runic tattoos is indelible and lasts after their final transformation. Chuul that result from Thayspawn are rudderless, powered only by lust for destruction. For this reason, Pyrrhus the warden burns any Thayspawn well before they reach this final form.

**Charybdis** is the spirit of the reef that resides in the Black Reach as a tree spirit would reside in a grove. It once controlled the ocean around the Black Reach through a hivemind of aquatic life, but now lay imprisoned in the depths bottom of the dungeon. It is cunning despite its weakness and hides the strength it has, waiting for its captors to make a mistake and give it an opportunity to escape.

**Pyrrhus** is a red dragonborn mercenary hired by Chiron of the Thay to be the warden of the Black Reach. He betrayed the draconic code long ago and was cast out of dragonborn society. He still harbours visions of himself as an honourable warrior, but these daydreams are delusional when set against his duties at the Black Reach. Pyrrhus interacts with Thay ships that come and go, accepting delivery of captured beasts in exchange for broken thralls. He lives in the upper halls of the Black Reach and does not venture into the depths unless absolutely necessary. Pyrrhus’s quarters contain a magic brazier that acts as a portal to the plane of fire, through which Pyrrhus can summon fire elementals if needed. He maintains the fire based traps in the upper halls, most of which are oriented so as to prevent creatures from breaking out of the prison instead of breaking in. He also torches any Thayspawn before they mutate into Chuul. In combat, Pyrrhus will try to lure intruders over fire based traps towards his brazier, where he will stand and fight with his fiery brethren.
 
**Driders of the House Arnach** patrol the depths of the Black Reach and maintain the connection to the Underdark. They provide fresh servants to Vincia and courier the precious amanitas back to the Drow cities deep below. The Driders resent Vincia for getting to have the fun of torturing beasts while they slog on patrol through the caverns, but as fanatically devoted servants of Lloth, they recognize their place in the hierarchy. That said, they would take the opportunity to betray Vincia if they thought they could win.

# Relationships:

## Charybdis

* Charybdis resides in the Black Reach as a tree spirit would reside in a grove. It is the effectively immortal embodiment of the reef and the seas around it.

* Charybdis hates Vincia with everything it has.

* It hardly notices Pyrrhus.

* Views Chiron as a interloper of the seas – a parasite to be removed.

* The party are like small reef fish that dart amongst the jaws of a much larger creature.

* Thayspawn are like seastar limbs - appendages to be spent with certainty that they will grow back. 

* Chuul are more precious and Charybdis weeps for their fate as a queen bee does for poisoned workers. Chuul are meant to exist as a school. Alone and without the strong mental presence of Charybdis guiding them, they are rabid.

* Driders are targets for domination to be warped and used to escape. Charybdis views the Drow’s practice of leaving Driders with independent thought as an abomination – isolation is death.

## Vincia of House Kel’ath

* Vincia covets the Black Reach as a site of power due to the shard of godhood that lies deep underground.

* Charybdis is just another horror to be lashed to the wheel. She has studied the creature but not appreciated its place in the sea’s pantheon.

* She toys with Pyrrhus and his sense of honour by making him partake in the breaking of beasts. She enjoys forcing him to confront his betrayal of dragonborn ideals.

* She is bothered by the rapid consumption of the Thayspawn. It is inelegant to have thralls that are so short lived.

* She recognizes Chuul as dangerous. Their minds are armoured with psychic chiton, making them immune to her typical spells. They are better left to be dealt with by Pyrrhus.

* Driders are simple brutes. Their spinnerets spin the webs that their minds cannot. That said, they are not to be used as substitutes for Thayspawn because they are too important to Lloth.

## Driders of House Arnach

* The Driders are at the Black Reach because Lloth demands it. They courier amanitas, other goods, and thralls through the tunnels that thread across the Underdark and link the Drow civilization.

* Vincia is to be feared, but not hated. The driders that failed her tests were weak.

* Pyrrhus is hated. One day they will take their revenge, if Lloth allows it. In the meantime, they stay deep and he stays near the surface.

* Thayspawn are mocked – they are poorly made puppets that prove the superiority of Lloth’s flesh magic. 

* Chuul are goaded into webbed traps to be dispatched by groups of driders, or are flushed upstairs for Pyrrhus to handle. 

* Charybdis is a false god that will one day share the fate of all false gods – bound and drained by Lloth.

## Pyrrhus

* Pyrrhus was blackmailed into service at the Black Reach by Chiron. Fear of what lies in the depths gnaws at him, but he’d kill (or die) before admitting it.

* Vincia is like a drug, alluring but toxic. Pyrrhus enjoys slipping into the role of knight and seneschal because it appeals to his sense of honour. He knows she is dangerous but does not appreciate the depths of her brutality.

* Driders are vermin, disgusting insects that deserve only hellfire. He loves burning them and their webs, but does not for fear of Vincia.

* Thayspawn are to be avoided as much as possible. Pyrrhus tattoos the scalp of fresh Thay sailors.

* Chuul are a worthy foe.
 
## Thayspawn

* To Thayspawn, Charybdis is seen as a wounded shape in the dark, to be tended and cared for. As time goes by, the relationship inverts as the Thayspawn succumb to its psychic power and they mutate into Chuul.

* Vincia is never seen by Thayspawn, only experienced as a powerful and despairing presence. They are more likely to deal with Vincia’s chain devil.

* Driders are sensed as rats in the walls. The mix of pity and horror expressed by the Thayspawn infuriates the driders.

* Pyrrhus is the chink in the armour through which Thayspawn could escape. Powerful, but beatable. This feeling persists in Chuul.

* Thayspawn do not know that other Thayspawn exist. Each believes they are alone in the Black Reach. More observant Thayspawn wonder why the barracks is so large and how the amanitas gardens stay alive. This mental tension rarely resolves before they mutate into Chuul.

* Chuul are sensed as earthquakes or rockslides - avoided and feared. Chuul do not attack Thayspawn.

# Hooks for Adventurers:

* An enemy of the Thay sent a spy to investigate the Black Reach and they have not been heard from since. The party is asked to find out what happened to them. The spy may still have some humanity or may already be a Thayspawn.

* During a storm a ship wrecked on the shore, releasing a huge and angry beast onto the nearby fishing villages. The beast was covered in strange tattoos and runes. The party is asked to find out where this beast came from.

* A kraken asks the party to rescue something precious to it (the aboleth) that is locked deep in the Black Reach. In return, the kraken will make the party powerful and rich. 

* The party is captured by Thay/Drow and wake up in the barracks of the Black Reach as Thayspawn. The aboleth senses their power and aims to use them as a catspaw to aid in its escape.

* Svirfneblin (deep gnomes) intercepted a courier carrying a package of amanitas into the Underdark. Recognizing the fell intent behind this mind control serum, they ask the party to trace the package to its source and put a stop to it.

* The church of any good aligned god (especially gods of trade/seafaring) would like the party to attack the Black Reach and expunge Charybdis once and for all


",1,The Black Reach - A dungeon of Lovecraftian body horror
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,27,315,"So I made an alternate Deck of Many Things because I felt the official deck would have been a little too extreme for me and my game. Here's the context.

My players had gotten a job escorting a cart of goods to the capital. They were level 3 at the time. When they arrive, they see that prep is being done for an upcoming festival. They decide to party with the locals and get nice clothes to blend in. They go to the festival, where a religious leader asks for volunteers to serve St. Cuthbert. There is an unknown reward and the players volunteer. Them and some other volunteers are taken inside and they get to draw cards from the deck.

I didn't want to use the actual deck because most of the effects seemed either too powerful for the level my players were at so I created my own that would keep the effects from destroying the game's power-scaling.

Here's the deck, hope you like it, and I'll take criticism to change it. I'll also be around to answer questions.

Roll a d20:  
1: Balance (Alignment Flip)  
2: Comet (Make a wish)  
3: Dungeon (You are teleported to a combat, cannot leave until over)  
4: Medusa (Auto-fail next 3 saving throws)  
5: Manor (You inherit a small mansion in a far away land)  
6: Flames (A demon fights you)

12: Idiot (Intelligence goes down by 2)  
13: Jester (Charisma goes up by 1)  
14: Book (Intelligence goes up by 1)  
15: Soldier (You are a criminal in another country, murder of a royal knight)  
16: Closet (You change race)  
17: Vizier (You ask the DM one question)  
18: Greed (Draw two more cards)

Edit:
I never called it the Deck of Many things in my game, so I could still introduce it in the future.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,288,"**Origins of a Mostly-Dead Goblin God:**
*Volo's Guide* (p.182) explains how Nilbogs came to be: Maglubiyet, the chief goblinid god, failed to eradicate the remnants of a goblin-trickster demigod. These ghostlike Nilbog godbits have a cult following, and as such, these trickster-terrorists could defy those serving Maglubiyet. This *revolting group o' goblins* can add flavour and depth to your campaign whilst staying within most RAW / RAI limits.

**The Enemy of My Enemy**
Maglubiyet-worshipping goblinids are far better prepared and more numerous - hence these small bands of cultist goblins have to make their struggle count. As such, they provide support for *anything / anyone that defies hobgoblin / bugbear oppression*. But how?

**List of Tactics &amp;/or Strategies - Conspiring Against Big Goblin**

- *Gathering vital information:* Undergoblins can walk into any hobgoblin camp, settlement or town and discover weaknesses, plans, troop numbers and so forth - they look just like normal goblins after all. Most top secret information is easily gained via *Suggestion* or even *Zones of Truth* (whilst using 'innocent' goblins to take the fall for these shenanigans). Bonus points for putting a Nilbog-possession on an enemy goblin leader *just long enough* to create a civil war. Any information gained is given to captured / released humans, dwarves, elves, orcs (or whatever else they can find... anyone willing to fight hobgoblins).

- *Building Defences for Hapless Enemies:* Making walls, towers, pit traps, collapsing tunnels, moats and more for poorly defended settlements. Undergoblin defences can be built for human towns are rapidly constructed with *Mold Earth* cantrips (ideas below).

- *Assisting Those Attacking Hobgoblins / Bugbears:* As their Nilbog Lords like to say: 'the devices for destruction are always underfoot!' Hobgoblins have a notoriously large number of slaves. Giving such *fine fun freedom-seekers* some arms + armour + lock picks + tactics can really create lots of hilarious activity (hilarious = horrid and deadly). Double points if you can do any such slave revolt whilst the [orcs / gnolls / kobolds / whatever] are attacking.

- *Developing Alliances:* Local Green dragons love gathering powerful Nilbog servants - these wee green folk get along with virtually anyone that is against that nasty god, Maglubiyet. Undergoblins are born and bred to be useful in virtually any court, including evil faye, lawful dragons, clever kobolds, wise orc shamans, desperate gnome settlements or even human towns that don't really want to be wiped out by invading hobgoblins.

**The Lost Goblins of the Nameless One - What Are They Like?**
Use +2 charisma instead of dexterity. Thus, logical class choices include warlocks, bards &amp;/or sorcerers ('court advisers &amp;/or entertainers'). Undergoblins gain a racial cantrip *Mold Earth* (EE p.21) &amp; *Suggestion* with progression. Many have great skill in stone sculpture, pottery-ceramics, architecture, siege weapon design &amp;/or civil / structural engineering. They always have knowledge, skill &amp; items to trade and are chronically desperate for (well armed) friends.

**Sample Adventure Ideas with Undergoblins:**

- Player characters are approached by one (1) lone goblin that claims he can save their town under hobgoblin siege. The insanity on this green guy is almost palpable - yet the guy is oddly charming and honest. He is suggesting to use underground tunnels and have everyone in the town escape over a few weeks. Then, using vast numbers of traps, bombs and weird devices, rig the entire city as a massive set of domino-cascading traps. It sounds like a terrible idea... but it might just work.

- Players are approached by a badly damaged hobgoblin vengeance-paladin. He can swear on his oaths that the Nilbog-essences are somehow gathering, making for a creature that is gaining some demigod powers. This is a problem: not only has the hobgoblins' authority been completely undermined, all sorts of their worst enemies (pick from elven-drow, orcs, dark-dwarves, gnolls, black dragons, wight-ghast leaders or whatever fits your campaign) have managed to gain a twisted alliance threatening every civilization on the surface world.

- A few Nilbog ghost-entities have enlisted the aid of KuoToa. These murlock-people are gladly worshipping this goblinid nameless demigod causing it to become, suddenly and rapidly, more powerful. Players have to use any means necessary (diplomacy? force? alternate faith pamphlets?) to get these fishy folk to worship nearly anything else before this gets out of hand.

- Towns of human and half elven lineage gained amazing defences (walls, turrets, siege weapons, etc.) in preparation for a few hobgoblin war bands. After the hobgoblins lost their battles the Nilbogs went on to new lands to thwart Maglubiyet. Now the rightful (human) king cannot collect even a copper in taxes from all of his fiefdoms - these prosperous trade-lands have become independent city states. As such, they have lost value, interest and respect for their noble overlords. Who should the players support?

- An adult Green dragon has teamed up with these bands of rebellious Nilbog-goblins and turned large numbers of hobgoblins and bugbears into slaves. The combined forces of the dragon's armies are bored and are taking out elven settlements until more hobgoblins show up. Players must track down any nearby hobgoblin army and convince them that attacking this green dragon's domain is a great idea. How will they do this?

- Nilbogs (&amp; goblin retinue) have somehow (???) gained the assistance of a few purple worm pets. To make matters worse they figured out how to soak the purple eggs / larvae in Blue dragon blood. Now these *gigantic half dragon wyrms-worms* are running amok: blasting out electric chaos. Mayhem ensues. What's more, many massive tunnels are giving the most horrid Deep Earth Denizens access to the surface world. Who, if anyone, can save the day?

- An Undergoblin circus has been on tour. This is amazing to behold: complete with the most exotic of creatures, the most amazing sights / sounds and the most spectacular events all take place while they visit at minimal cost. Undergoblins are natural diplomats and supernatural entertainers! Also, whilst there, massive walls and towers go around the town to protect the locals before the entire circus leaves town without a trace (Undergoblins tunnel out / disappear underground). Soon after the circus is gone, these towns go under grand siege from angry hobgoblin war bands: furious that anyone would *aid and abet* their known Nilbog nemesis. Players must get ahead of this travelling circus and warn towns and villages not to accept these wonderful performances &amp; gifts from the Undergoblins - unless they are willing to pay the price thereafter.

**Bonus Material:**

*Mold Earth* - [everything counts in large amounts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-gK-9EIq4):

- Loose earth is about [75lbs per square foot](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/earth-soil-weight-d_1349.html). This can easily be rammed, compacted and shaped. It can also be used to carry larger stones so as to assemble a cobblestone or useful [retaining wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhRF57JMuI). These would not hold off any respectable siege engines but they would slow down even the most massive armies for a few weeks.

- One casting of this spell moves 9375 lbs (5 x 5 x 5 x 75lbs) of dirt five feet. A small band of ten such Undergoblins moves 93,750 lbs per six seconds or 937,500lbs per minute. In ten minutes they move 9,375,000 lbs of sand, stone, rocks and clay. This means that they can probably build a town-defence within hours (assuming proper civil engineering capacity and knowledge). The spell makes no mention of sound, so one can assume they could do this in total silence at night, whilst any town sleeps.

- The ability to [cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron) various materials like clay, ceramics, iron and other metals would be excellent. Sadly, this process makes for poor weapons and armour. The upside: Undergoblins always have vast amounts of goods to trade and can support the merchants of a town at little to no cost. The downside: other than making one-shot items (spear tips, arrowheads, low-quality chest plates and miserably fragile swords or shields), most of their fabricated weapons kind of suck. Great [frying pans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru-92YnNQUA) though.

- Their ability to make giga-traps would be excellent. Building tunnels that collapse with certain weight (pre-sapping the ground near defence wall lines) is a fantastic siege defence. Hobgoblins falling into a massive pit trap would either be dead or defenceless - and they would be doing so directly near the defensive wall lines, in the range of archers. 

- Undergoblins would also be masters at making domino-style collapsing architecture. As one building falls it triggers the fall of two or more other buildings - and so on until all previously rigged buildings are down. This can make use of terrain features such as downhill rockslides, rolling logs, exploding dams and more. Hobgoblin troops (and their slaves) caught within such a self-destructing town can typically be considered dead &amp;/or badly wounded.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,60,"Allow me the pleasure to introduce you to Fenrus Bulldust. A 10 foot tall Minotaur Beastmaster Ranger that has both a heart of gold and a nasty temper.

Physical Description: Fenrus is your classic menacing minotaur with a few quirks in his appearance. His skin/fur is a silver grey color with white splotches. He is very muscular and well built, but has very long droopy ears and a dewlap of skin that hangs from his jaw down to his neck (think of the Brahman Cow). He has massive horns that stand upright  and account for three feet of his height (think Ankole-Watusi). Yes... he is actually only 7 foot tall, but those long tall horns make it impossible for him to enter doorways  without either crouching or crawling on all fours.

He wears simple steel breastplate armor with a worn out green leather shirt underneath and black pants. A black tabard with gold trim and the image of a stag drapes over his armor that represents The Menagerie guild he is apart of. He also carries a black khopesh with silver runes inscribed in the blade and a heavy crossbow.

Personality: Fenrus is very kind hearted for a Minotaur and tries to help parties whenever he can. He always seems to know what's going on no matter how personal or hush hush the situation and is liable to give pointers to help the party. They may not always be the best pointers but he leaves that to the party's discretion. He is also a great lover of the outdoors and wildlife. His favorite animals are cats and will pet them at any given chance. It doesn't matter if it's a house cat, wild cat, or Tabaxi PC... if it's a cat he will want to hold it and pet it all while repeating the words ""Kitty"".

Despite his kind disposition he is still a bull headed Minotaur with an attitude.  If he catches anyone making fun of him... especially his droopy ears or long horns he will immediately snap into a fit of rage and try to destroy whoever made the comments. He also hates terrible music and has been known to throw bards out of taverns if he doesn't find the music pleasing.

Fenrus can often be found in taverns when in town kicking back his favorite beverage, milk and honey. When not in a tavern, Fenrus always shows up in odd places or when you least expect him to show. His timing isn't always good though and can make for a very awkward situation. 

When he does show up... it's either to give the party tips on a quest, lend a hand, or show everyone his pet lion, Sheba. More often than not it will be to talk about his lion. 

Have fun with Fenrus Bulldust.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,47,"**Summary:** As a heretical servant of Marduk, Erra, god of political disaster, carries out his god’s dictates mercilessly, bringing plague to the punished and divine protection to the obedient. 

**Alignment:** Lawful Evil

**Domains:** Arcana, Death

**Titles:** Tyrant of Tyrants

**Symbol:** Black skull within a red seven-pointed star (symbolizing the Sebitti)

**Manifestations:** A glowing, shapeshifting red cloud of blood

**Virtues:** Ambition, self-preservation, vigilance

**Backstory:** During his mortal lifetime, Erra was a descendant and inquisitor of the priesthood of Marduk, the divine leader of the Sevenfold Way. His role was to root out corruption within and outside of the ranks of the church hierarchy; as a gifted wizard, his intelligence and perceptiveness were legendary. No criminals escaped Erra’s punishment, and he was renowned for his upstanding and decisive behavior. However, heresy brewed in his heart: deep down, he began to believe that he was the superior judge of humans, not his god Marduk, sparking his own desire for divinity. When an unsuspecting Marduk elevated his loyal servant to godhood, Erra finally got his wish. Erra lives on to execute the harshest divine judgements of the gods. He is best known for releasing plagues afflicting entire cities, a pretense for his agents to seize power and maintain “order.” Erra, the figurehead of pure justice, fell to become the scheming god of authoritarianism, disaster, and political coups. 

**Organization:** Erra’s worshippers today fall into two groups: those who sincerely honor him so that he may assist in their underhanded political aspirations, and those who sincerely supplicate him so that hey may spare them from disaster. (Erra’s name and image often appear in figures of speech and prophylactic amulets intended to protect against disease; it is commonly believed to have some kind of magical property. Priests of Erra sell amulets of protection from plague in exchange for loyalty to his mission.) His organized priesthood is obviously the larger threat, infiltrating and overthrowing governments to replace them with Erra’s own tyrannical agents. Some city-states may actually have been quite open about their worship of Erra at a time, honoring him as a god of order, public safety, and soldiers. Seven agents, called the Sebitti, are handpicked by Erra to run his church; though each is given their allotment of land to conquer, it is said they nevertheless hunger to usurp power over each other. 

**Relationships:** Erra’s existence and elevation to godhood is one of the biggest embarrassments to the church of Marduk. Worship of Erra is officially outlawed by almost all city-states, and is considered tantamount to treason. Good-aligned gods of justice, such as the sun god Shamash, openly oppose and fight him, as do various chaotic gods that chafe under Erra’s constraints. Efforts to root out Erra’s worshipers have been known to become quite extreme, with ordinary people being punished just for having his image in their homes. And wherever the law is riddled with paranoia and mercilessness, Erra rules. 

**Tenets:**  

* Know that reasoning with the enemy is dangerous and futile; resistance is a force to be crushed, not debated. 

* Words are power; wield them carefully to win your true allies. 

* Remain forever vigilant, so that you may never fall to the same weaknesses you once exploited. 

**Obligatory quote:**

*“Revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets, and cannons - authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror its arms inspire in the reactionaries.”* 
- Friedrich Engels ",1,"Erra, Tyrant of Tyrants, executioner of the gods"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,52,601,"Let me introduce you to a ring merchant and explorer Giofasat Barbaro that is in a part of my upcoming dungeon. His name may or may not have been [stolen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giosafat_Barbaro). He is a bit of a con artist but should be rather memorable. Hopefully he will fit into some of your games like I hope he will into mine.

&amp;#x200B;

Giofasat is a middle aged male gnome. He is wearing a round explorers hat with a tiny dagger tucked underneath band on the top. From underneath the hat you can see a litlle bit of curly ginger hair. He wears a leather waistcoat which has been embroidered with the image of a sabertooth tiger on the left side. Underneath is a plain white shirt which due to heavy use is covered in yellow and black stains as well as a couple of leather patches from where it has been torn. On his feet he has a pair of brown pants which have also been patched with some pieces of leather due to wear and tear.

&amp;#x200B;

Giofasat is always found in the oddest of places, in shady back alleys, dungeon rooms or standing at the edge of a crater. He will not reveal how he got there but is always eager to talk to any who pass by and attempt to sell them something.

&amp;#x200B;

Wherever he goes Giofasat keeps with him his signature wooden wheelbarrow which contains all his belongings as well as a pile of books which he has written about his journeys. He is always willing to sell these for a fair sum. They contain travel descriptions and are mostly accurate guides for traversing the area which they talk about. A creature which has read one of Giofasat's books gets a +2 to survival check made in that area.   
Some example titles which are flavored for my world: 

* G.B. and the mountains of Titan
* There and back; a lonely gnome in Borbaland
* Ecology of the Sandy Flatlands (3 Volumes)

Giofasat also has a satchel which holds his actual merchandise, a bunch of magical rings. All of the rings work simalarly, they require the user to speak a command word which activates the ring for 10 minutes, after this the ring has a cooldown of 2 hours during which it can't be used again. The catch is that the effect of the ring only affects the ring and not it's wearer. This means that for example the ring of fire resistance grants fire resistance only to the ring and that the ring of water walking only makes the ring float on top of water and not the wearer and that the ring of invisibility turns only the ring invisible and so on and forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Giofasat will never state that his rings only affect the ring but he will use vague language to  disguise the truth about the rings. He will usually describe how to activate the ring and will leave the effect for the buyers imagination. Most people will not question anything and will be happy to buy a ring or two due to their relatively cheap price (\~20 gold). Giofasat will tell them however that the ring will need an hour to activate before it can be used for the first time. This is of course a lie but it will give him enough time to vanish from the scene. It is never clear whether he ran away or teleported but afterwards he will be no where to be found. He may then reappear at another time in an another dubios location for your players to find.",1,"Giofasat Barbaro, a ring merchant and explorer - a NPC to scam your players"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,122,"**Background**

My homebrew world focuses on a Mesopotamian-inspired region called the Nahar. Because religion is one of my main interests, I focus a lot on how religion interacts with the rest of Naharian culture. Based on my limited knowledge of Mesopotamian religion, I noticed that I had trouble finding an absence of figures that we might today describe as akin to Abrahamic “angels.” There were, however, tales like the Epic of Gilgamesh, where the protagonist is said to be “two-thirds divine and one-third mortal,” and capable of amazing feats on his adventures with Enkidu. This sounded like an interesting inspiration for an aasimar adventurer, but with literally godly heritage instead of heritage from any good-aligned celestial creature. 

Furthermore, there are the Annunaki, which have contradictory definitions in different time periods. Their numbers and role are inconsistent across sources. There’s already a lot of nonsense out there about the Annunaki, but this is a fantasy game so I decided to run with my own interpretation. In this universe, the Annunaki are basically minor deities that were (almost always) aasimar in their mortal lives. (There are exceptions like [Ninkilim](https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a9fj9p/ninkilim_the_noble_mongoose_the_feygod/), originally a fey, but he was not the same as an ordinary mortal to begin with.) By performing notable deeds, they are elevated to godhood after their deaths. From that point on, they basically function as minor deities who deal with rather specific domains, sort of like patron saints in Catholicism. I feel that this creates a good kind of drama for motivating aasimar PCs. So, this is my twist on how aasimar with divine heritage might deal with their condition. 

**Origins**

Aasimar, as a race, do not have a single shared history, arising from various phenomena across space and time. A priestess seduced by a divine vision, a miraculous conception, or even an assault by an aggressive god - these are some of the many origins of aasimar. They can appear across racial, class, gender, and other lines. However, some generalizations can be made about aasimar development and place in broader society, namely the awareness of their divine heritage and mandate. Unlike other mortals, aasimar can wear melam, the divine splendor that characterizes a god and distinguishes them as capable of receiving worship. However, they may not obtain melam until their deaths, when their ancestral god(s), gods of the Underworld, and others judge them to be deserving of the honor of godhood. An aasimar becomes deserving of melam by performing notable deeds that satisfy the will of their ancestral god(s). 

**The Politics of Ancestry**

Besides those broad strokes, other differences arise, namely in issues of origins (and attitudes towards them), as well as in relationships between aasimar and their ancestral god(s). For instance, some aasimar are born into established mortal bloodlines spanning back aeons, and may be obsessed with gaining family prestige or establishing togetherness by elevating as many members to godhood as possible. Other aasimar may be born to ordinary parents, their divine blood unexpectedly manifesting from somewhere earlier in the family line. Some of the former may look down upon the latter as bastards and flukes, while the latter see the former as elitist and insincere. 

**Maturity and Psychology**

Becoming aware of one being an aasimar can be an exhilarating or stressful experience. Some aasimar’s heritage is obvious from birth due to startling characteristics such as more than two eyes, metallic skin, or gigantism. These aasimar tend to be “genetically” closer to their divine ancestors. Other aasimar, particularly those born to ordinary parents, do not show signs of - or even are not aware of - their divine heritage until they mature. Subtler traits include silver hair, solid-colored eyes, or skin that appears iridescent in direct sunlight. Although aasimar live to around 160 years, they do not show any outward signs of aging associated with other mortals. Though they can weaken internally and die like any other mortal, aasimar born of races with shorter lifespans often have to grapple with the impermanence of many of their relationships. Therefore, some gravitate toward elves and similarly long-lived races for companionship. Furthermore, aasimar youth often become aware of their divine mandate around this time. It’s basically like spending all your life coasting through school until you reach high school, and then your hypercompetitive parents demand you get all As, except here your parents are literally gods. 

**Divine Relationships**

Aasimar can react to their revelations very differently. Some see their condition as a blessed opportunity to please their ancestral god(s) so that they may join the ranks of the Annunaki, said to be as innumerable as stars in the sky. Others chafe under the pressure or even rebel against this mandate. Ultimately, aasimar have freedom of choice in that they are not forced to act by their ancestral gods, nor are they beholden to them in terms of alignment. Furthermore, aasimar can be descended from gods of any alignment, including evil ones. Some ancestral deities take an active interest in promoting the development of their descendants, while others are completely indifferent. Whether to fulfill or defy their fate, many aasimar have appeared to take up the call of the adventurer. ",1,"Aasimar, Heirs to the Divine"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,114,"**Intro:** I'll be running a horror campaign (CoS) soon, and enjoy the *idea* of using Madness to enforce character trauma. But the Horror effect is abrupt and heavy handed. I want my players to know that trauma is inevitable, but not to know when they're near a breaking point. I also don't like imposing Madness effects that have nothing to do with their personality; it ungrounds the character and makes it harder to resolve Madness with character growth. Lucidity was my hybrid solution.

**Premise:** Lucidity represents your fortitude against the traumas of the world; the purity of your heart or the clarity of your mind. You do not know your own Lucidity pool: It is hard to know when the horrors will catch you off-guard.

**Caveat:**  This mechanic involves the GM altering personality traits, and as such requires a lot of buy-in, trust, and communication between you and your players. The dice being what they are, you might also end up with very disparate levels of madness as the game progresses.

**Recommended setup:** Have each player set up 3 Ideals, 3 flaws, and 3 bonds (1-2 intra-party bonds can help a lot).

**Mechanics:**  At the beginning of the campaign, the GM rolls 1d6 in secret for each character to determine their current Lucidity pool.

Lucidity levels can be changed in the following manners:

* Certain creatures, environments, or character choices will cause INT/CHA/WIS Saving Throws against Horror. Each failure decreases Lucidity by 1.

* Each failed death decreases Lucidity by 1.

* When a character's Ideals, Bonds, or Flaws is on the line, they may spend 1 Lucidity to gain Inspiration (advantage on an attack/check/saving throw).

* When a character fulfills an ideal, overcomes a flaw, or achieves a major objective, you may grant them 1 Lucidity.

When the party takes its next long rest (or between sessions) any player at 0 Lucidity takes on a Madness - A subversion, addendum, or exception to their current ideals/flaws/bonds. The Madness is shaped by the traits and the circumstances that brought it on. The GM then rolls in secret again for player lucidity.

**Examples** *(Madness in italics)*:

* Ideal: Order. The laws are meant to preserve the social order—everything in its proper place. -&gt; The laws are meant to preserve the social order - *and I enjoy reminding everyone of their proper place*.

* Bond: My wife was taken by demons. My work is my tribute to her. -&gt; My wife was taken by demons. *From my work I make tributes for her.*

* Flaw: A well executed process of elimination will always discover the truth. I just need to keep eliminating possibilities, *and liars*

As characters grow and overcome situations related to this madness, the traits can be resolved and returned to normal.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,41,622,"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9xnb5t/creating_varied_npcs/), I decided to create [my own table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xtiatj1_FqQibdr0vuH03ayirNHtqr5-t0dEYOk_tOc/edit?usp=sharing) for generating interesting personality for NPCs. My method is based on Myers-Briggs theory, combined with a personality quirk table from /r/d100.

To me, the interesting thing about using Myers-Briggs theory is that there's space for a lot of variety (32 different personalities), and as you describe each aspect of the NPC their background comes to life. Here's an example that I generated using my method:

**Trisfiel** is a female elf. For her personality, we roll:

* 1d4: 2
* 1d6: 4
* 1d8: 1
* 1d12: 6
* 1d20: 11
* 1d100: 47

Her personality, then, is **INTJ-T**. Trisfiel is an **Introvert**, but she’s also **iNtuitive**. She enjoys the outdoors, staying away from her village for hours in the woods, curious about the world she lives in, trying to understand it better without the overwhelming sounds and smells of her village.

Her nature is **Thinking**, and because of that she doesn’t have a great interest in her village nor her neighbors. She thinks that attachment to other people is foolish, and she plans to leave soon in order to prove herself to her parents and her family.

Trisfiel is also **Judging**. In her case, this manifests as having a clear plan (and a backup plan) for her life. She’s been practicing her cantrips by herself in the woods, hoping to be able to attend the University of Magic in the capital one day. If she fails the test, she plans on becoming an adventurer and learn magic on her own.

Trisfiel’s identity is **-Turbulent**. She’s always looking for ways to push herself, and she is eager to improve her spellcasting abilities. Finally, her quirk is that she giggles nervously when trying to lie, or when she knows that someone else is. This has led her to trouble more than once when her parents asked why she was spending so much time alone in the forest, sine they don’t approve her becoming a magic user.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,105,"Alright so this city state is a bit out there, but I was thinking about how Yuan ti could become a neutral or good people. Eventually that tangent lead off to this odd place which I think might work.     
     
***     
     
#History     
     
Several thousand years ago, the yuan ti empire was vast. They had colonies on all the continents and enslaved many of the less developed races.   
    
But a rapid change in climate caused the world to grow much colder. In areas where winter was previously a rarity, permafrost was settling in. If it wasn't for the cooling of the world, the yuan ti likely would have conquered the planet.    
     
In the northern areas of the world, yuan ti were dying extraordinarily quickly. Their cold blooded bodies could not stand the frost that was setting in. Even their serpent deities stopped responding as they no longer had any domain in this frigid environment.   
    
A small splinter group of purebloods and malisons journeyed in hoping to reach the warmer areas. But they would have to walk for hundreds of miles in order to reach a safe place.    
Without much hope, they retreated to a hot spring they found.    
     
Having lost their technology, civilization, and most of their people, the yuan ti devolved into a hunter gatherer group. They would always have to return to their hot spring in order to not die of hypothermia. They prayed to their serpent gods, but they had no power in the tundra.    
    
However another goddess found their prayers. The mother of magma: a deity born from the gods of fire and earth. She had a kind heart, but a short temper. Very few knew about the mother of magma, only a small group of tropical humans and fire giants worshiped her. To the humans she was known as Pele, while to the giants she was called Sumendi.   
Despite having few followers, the mother of magma has the domain of all volcanoes, hot springs, lava, and other sources geothermal heat.    
She told them that she could bestow them with her blessing, but they would have to reject their previous gods and follow her instead. They would never be able to go back to the serpent deities, but they would have a new patron goddess who would watch over them and keep them alive in the frozen wastes.     
     
The yuan ti disagreed at first. Their serpent gods were articles of perfection that usurped all others. The mother of magma bargained more explaining how they could never go south without her assistance. And even if they went south, their gods likely would have forgotten and abandoned them for good. Still, the stubborn yuan ti denied her request.      
The mother of magma was tired of these games and saw that these yuan ti needed a push in the right direction. So she removed the heat from the hot spring they were staying and watched them slowly start to panic. While some choose to freeze, the majority of the yuan ti accepted the mother of magma's gift.    
     
The mother of magma levitated them above the earth and drew lava from the crust of the land. She infused it into their blood and minds and tore them away from their old gods. She bestowed upon them the gift of emotion so they could feel both her kindness and her rage.   
    
The yuan ti now felt no pain from the freezing winds. Their bodies glowed a faint red under their now black colored scales.    
Now declaring full allegiance to the mother of magma, they gave her the yuan ti name Nasavas (na-SA-vas).   
    
She restored the heat to their hot spring and used her lava to cut away at the stone. She made a home for them beneath the earth so they can be closer to their paraelemental goddess. Before she left to her divine realm in the paraelemental plane of magma, she gave one last gift to them.     
Beneath their home, a new type of gemstone would be created by her. This stone would imbue the powers of magma on metal it was embedded into. She called it Ignilyte, naming after it's fiery properties.    
     
These yuan ti started calling themselves the Scorchscales after their magmatic transformation. While it took them a long time to develop their civilization, they created a subterranean city that rivals that of dwarves.     
     
Due to her gaining the worship of yuan ti, the mother of magma has added a new pantheon to her reservoir. In addition to being an paraelemental, human, and giant deity, she is also a serpent god. This makes her the only good god within the yuan ti pantheon.     
This has drawn the ire of the other serpent gods as they see her as an corrupting force. Her bipolar emotional status between kindness and rage stands against everything that the emotionless and ambitious serpent gods stand for.     
To this day, yuan ti worshiping other serpent deities avoid living near volcanoes and hot springs out of fear for her wrath. Magma paraelementals are also a sworn enemy of non Scorchscaled yuan ti.    
      
#City Structure    
     
Above ground, Sekvol appears to be little more than a small settlement. Due to the constant cold temperatures, most of the city is underground. All that there is on the surface is a gate to keep out winds and animals, the original hot spring now called Taslasp, and the long pathway down to the main part of the city. Often a few guards will be posted here, but little can be seen.    
    
After an 80ft descent of stoneworked steps, visitors reach the main part of the city called the crucible. The crucible is a massive cave system lit with continual flames. Buildings here are often artificial caves being molded by the magma priests of Nasaa. It is always a comfortable mild temperature due to it being so far below the ground. However as people get closer to Nasaa, it will start to get very warm.    
    
There are four main sectors within the crucible. Usnai, Issrilan, Yuniss, and Nasaa.    
     
Usnai is the largest market in Sekvol.   
Due to it's isolation from the rest of the world, most traders enter through a permanent teleportation circle in the edge of the district. Here, traders can buy all sorts of products that Sekvol produces such as precious gems, ore, Ignilyte, smithed items, arctic game meat and pelts, bound paraelementals of magma, spell scrolls, stone artwork, and the occasional magic item.     
Many traders from outside Sekvol spend time here selling items that they can not get in their arctic underground home. In particular, foods, lumber, paper, textiles, and leather are the most sought after.     
Many of the middle class traders who live in Sekvol work here.    
    
Issrilan is the mining district of Sekvol.     
It is the deepest section of Sekvol. They dig looking for ores, gems, and the exclusive Ignilyte. Most of the lower class populace work here as it requires the least amount of skill.    
Magma priests sometimes visit Issrilan in order to carve out new places to mine and create supports from igneous rock.    
    
Yuniss is the residential district of Sekvol.     
Here the vast majority of Sekvolans live. They live in carved out houses. Lower class Sekvolans live in handcrafted houses, while middle and higher class Sekvolans live in houses carved out by magma priests.      
This is the only part of the city to have hatcheries, so Scorchscale children playing in the streets is a common sight.     
While Usnai had the vast majority of the traders, some traders selling more general goods have set up shops here.    
While the most of the city worships Nasavas, there are two temples to other gods in Yuniss. Moradin is worshipped here due to the rising dwarven population and his relationship to smithing, a major industry in Sekvol. Mystra is also worshipped as the Scorchscales use magic extensively.    
      
Nasaa is the center of magic and government in Sekvol.    
Here, the temperature increases significantly. On the outer edge are are a few churches to Nasavas. They are created out of obsidian stone with an amphitheater seating arrangement. In the front is where the priests deliver sermons, conduct ceremonies, and drop offerings to Nasavas in a deep hole that goes down to a magma flow.    
Several wizardry schools are also here. The Scorchscales have dug up many artifacts from their former empire and studied them here. The arcane secrets they have can provide insight into what the original yuan ti were like.   
Further in, only government officials and magma priests are allowed to go in without documentation. Here there are tunnels going deep into the earth where magma priests can stand before magma flows and praise their goddess. On the far end is the governmental building. It is where all the governmental officials decide on laws and live.    
     
#The culture     
     
Due to Nasavas warping the mind of the yuan ti into a more emotional race, the Scorchscales are a tempestuous people. Just like their goddess, they tend to switch between two mindsets.    
     
The first represents the kind warmth that geothermal activity can bring. Hot springs sooth the body and mind. Volcanoes cause the lands around them to be incredibly fertile.     
The second represents the fiery, angry, and passionate side of geothermal activity. Volcanic eruptions can cover the land in soot and scorch the earth. Earthquakes can tear open fissues and cause immense destruction.     
     
The Scorchscales tend to dance between these two emotional states. However, they tend to learn to lean towards one way or the other once they reach an old age.     
      
Scorchscales who are fiery tend to work extraordinarily well. While they may explode at the smallest question, they know their craft very well. It's usually expected to leave fiery Scorchscales alone until they have cooled down in order to not get them angry.    
When a Scorchscale prefers to be in a fiery mood, they are usually more solitary people. They work on worshiping Nasavas, mining in Issrilan, or studying magic alone. But when alone, fiery scorchscales work very quickly and efficiently.     
     
Warm Scorchscales are kind souls who care for others. They want others to prosper and will assist anyone who asks for help. Many of the traders, merchants, magma priests, and government officials are more warm aligned Scorchscales.    
     
Due to the fact that female yuan ti lay eggs instead of giving live birth, Yuniss has several hatcheries. Here the eggs are warmed under a magical heating system. Parents are notified when their children are about to hatch. Many bets are made as well to see what Ophidian features the children will have before they're born.     
     
Food is practically impossible to grow here, so most Sekvolans eat food created magically by the magma priests. Prestidigitation spell scrolls are very cheap here, so people can flavor their food however they want. Scorchscales who inherit an Ophidian head can usually only digest meat however.    
Real food is usually a luxury item sold by out of town traders. While it may not taste as good as the magical food, it is still seen with prestige for it's higher cost.    
     
Despite having their mind altered by their goddess, Scorchscales still have an innate sense of ambition. But it is more of a friendly competition of who's the best rather than a backstabbing pyramid scheme.   
      
#The locals     
     
Sekvol has the following population demographics:    
Scorchscale Yuan ti: 72%    
Dwarves: 17%    
Humans: 6%    
Genasi: 3%    
Other races: 2%   
     
Scorchscale yuan ti make up the vast majority of the population. Most of the common folk have features similar to pureblood and malison yuan ti. Unlike regular yuan ti, Scorchscale malisons and yuan ti aren't that different from each other in terms of power and social standing.     
Scorchscales who have been blessed with the powers of clerics and magma manipulation are known as magma priests. They appear similar to yuan ti abominations, with serpentine heads, tails, and skin. They are necessary for Sekvol to function, so magma priests are always among the upper class in Sekvol.     
A single anathema equivalent is within Sekvol. Her name is Istreeti and she has powers to manipulate magma, stone, and fire far more than any other Scorchscale.      
      
The city of Sekvol is rather similar to dwarven cities. Underground structures, a large mining facility, a strong network of worship, and a group of peaceful people are all something that dwarven cities and Sekvol have in common. There has even been whispers that the mother of magma may actually have an version of herself enter the dwarven pantheon with all the dwarves in Sekvol.    
     
Humans of course are easy to find everywhere. But due to Sekvol's isolation, it's harder for people to enter compared to a regular city. So only the most interested of humans live in Sekvol rather than just traveling as a merchant.    
    
Fire and Earth genasi will find a home here. They are treated with a great amount of respect here with their affinity for an aspect of Nasavas. But neither represent the perfect balance of magma, so they aren't treated the same as a magma priest.    
     
Racism is infrequent in Sekvol and all races are treated equally provided they act in a reasonable manner. But travel is difficult, so only so many minorities can be found here.    
     
#Government     
      
The government in Sekvol is primarily controlled by three parties. The first is the eruption, a group of magma priests represented in the government. The second is the quake, a group of elected officials that are voted democratically by Sekvolan citizens. The last is Istreeti, the most powerful person in the city.    
    
The quake and the eruption both vote on issues and laws together. There are only 45 of each, and if they can't come to a decision, Istreeti will make it for them.     
Law enforcement is small as the majority of the people in Sekvol have no desire to do criminal acts. But the law enforcement officers all report back to a secretary hired by Istreeti and approved by the quake.      
    
Legal disputes are settled by a single judge and no jury. The defendant and prosecution each are provided with an attorney if they cannot afford one. The eruption hires the judges in the city after they have been approved by Istreeti.     
      
There is no military in Sekvol. Their isolation makes the only form of travel either through a vicious tundra or a teleportation circle. However if there was ever an attack on the city, Istreeti and her magma priests would defend it.     
Anyone stupid enough to try will likely be burnt to death by the searing magma they conjure and manipulate.    
      
***     
     
Well that was the scorchscales and Sekvol. If you think I missed anything or if you have any questions, comments or concerns, please say so!",1,"The Scorchscales, a race of good yuan ti with an arctic underground city state that worships magma"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,51,"A few notes before we start

The Gray Wastes(also known as Hades), as presented in the official materials, suck.

I know, it's a strong judgement, but it's true: first they're not even a place, they're a gimmick. And not even a good gimmick: it's an entire plane of depression, boredom and grey fog. Yay, can't wait to go adventuring there. Emotions and passion are literally what drives an adventure. And even if you really want a gothic, depressing adventure, just use Ravenloft. It's the same concept but better. Or, like, a swamp in England. It's basically the same thing.

----------
So here is my take on it: **Niflheim, the bleak gorge**

----

Diary of Tom Longshoe, day 1

*I feel a bit silly doing this, but I need something to vent, and I have n'one to talk to. Things are bad. Weather's been getting worse and worse for a few years, fog and cold more common dan they used to, but we never did pay much attention. Nature doing its thing, I thought. Seems like I should have. Ol' man Fred said he keeps hearing whispers from right outside his field when plowin' and the two McKenzie daughters disappered last week when playing on the river. People talk of nightmares, everybody is nervous. And I can swear the sun used t'be hotter. I'll ask my wife a few rations, want to go to the count castle ask for some soldiers.*

----
----

Niflheim is a plane of annihilation, that expands itself in the prime material by devouring hopes, happiness and life.

The plane exists in the Gray Wastes, but it can seep through the planes and ""infect"" the mortal world: where there has been a great tragedy, a terrible act of evil or ritual, sometimes, Niflheim can leak. 

That area of the world will become partially part of the Gray Wastes: thick fog, grey soil and vegetation and a cold sun that weakly peeks through the constant clouds. 

And with the fog come hags, spirits, nightmares, death and worse. 

The infection starts slowly: winters are longer, sunlight a bit duller. Few may notice something changed, even fewer recognize the reason.

Over the years, the climate will become harsher and colder, damp and uncomfortable, and the infected area will grow: when it starts it may be limited to a small village or hamlet, but in a decade or two it could cover a whole forest or province and, with enough time, a whole region. 

There is no known limit to how much it can spread, theoretically, but in practice, it rarely spreads this much: Niflheim revels in isolation, paranoia and seclusion, and requires a great amount of energy to spread. The plane isn't sentient in any real way, it's more similar to a force of nature following the current of mortal emotions.

The area it touches are, usually, secluded in the woods, swamps or mountains, and don't have enough people in them to sustain infinite growth, while large cities are too varied and full of emotions for the process to start and once the area is enveloped by fog, it becomes hard to enter or leave it.
  
But that's just the fluff, the gothic atmosphere that follows the plane. Its meat is in its inhabitants and influence

Diary of Tom Longshoe, day 15

Three times tried to reach the castle, three times found miself in the middle of town like 'n idiot. Something's really bad. The wife tells me to not worry, the gods protect us, but the priest's been acting strange lately. I've hear bad rumours, seems even the mayor's been involved in some scandal or another.""

----

**Survival**

Surviving in an area touched by Niflheim is easy, living is extremely hard: the plane exists to keep people alive, but miserable, and the suffering of its victims allows it to grow and powers its native inhabitants.

**Afflictions of Niflheim**: People that live in Niflheim develop various mental problems and physical deformities over time. Once when first entering the area, and again every 30 days spent in it, any mortal creature must pass a Wisdom check with DC 15 or suffer from one of these effects. 

A creature can have only 2 or 3 of these at the same times, and local NPCs will probably have 2 unless they are especially strong-willed.
 
**Note** - These are NOT mental illnesses. They're not problems in your own brain, they are more similar to charms, illusion and compulsions that the plane uses to mess with people, but over time they can leave deep scars, and cause regular problems to appear. Protections from evil, mental influence and magic may stop these effects. Protections against sickness will not.

Also, these are the names the locals give to them, they're not medically accurate. Details may vary greatly, as they're often confused with regular illnesses.

- Madness

The victim starts having sudden mood swings, becoming suddenly violent, sad or angry. 

This is caused by changes in the world around them that only them can perceive: The plane causes pain in their joints, their hands suddenly go cold, the words they hear are twisted to have a mocking or muffled tone. Their favourite food may start having a bland taste, their favourite painting looks drab and washed out.

The victim has a very hard time conveying these changes to others, as they appear slowly, over time, and aren't noticed by others, causing them to appear insane and end up isolated, bitter and angry. 

This progresses into true hallucinations and voices.

- Sadism

When the victim hurts others, the plane curse is temporarily lifted from them. They will feel warm, breath well, colours will be vibrant and intense for a few hours. 

If they hurt again, looking for that rush, it will happen again. But if they keep doing it, the change will become shorter and shorter but more intense, until they develop a true dependence from it. The plane rewards them for hurting others with very intense but brief shocks of ""happiness"", like a drug of sort.

Some people learn to control this, realizing what's going on, and fight against the urge. Others fall into it completely, but it escalates rapidly, usually resulting in violent killing sprees and their death when they become reckless.

- Grey sickness

The skin becomes grey and frail, easily cracking and wounding. Joint pain, headaches, dry mouth, hairs falling, everything that causes pain but isn't deadly will happen to the victim.

 It takes time to develop, even years, but eventually, all the small pains and annoyances pile up, making their life truly miserable without constant medical care. This also causes a great deal of stress and exhaustion.

- Paranoia

Shadows appear at the edge of the vision. From the corner of his eye, the victim will see people doing strange movements and gestures. Shadows move behind closed doors and windows. Strange creaking noises. 

The plane constantly creates minor illusions and sounds around the victim, isolating them, and eating away at their sanity.

Eventually, people will start smelling of blood or rotting meat, gnawing noises will come from just outside their door and nobody else will notice, driving the victim mad.

- Kleptomania

Specific objects will suddenly appear inviting: lush colours, pungent smells, enticing sounds. Those objects always belong to someone else. 

The victim is pushed to steal those objects and spend time obsessing over them, as they appear to be the only isle of beauty in their dark, depressing world.

Being caught stealing causes strife, isolation, paranoia and violence and can cause problems even in a tight group of heroes or sages.

- Obsession

Similar to Kleptomania, but it's about a specific object, action or place. Maybe a specific set of clothes will be the only one that is comfortable, warm and not prickly, or a ring they own will look particularly lord-y. Maybe the sound of the stream behind their home calms them, or the voice of a handmaiden rings like silver bells when every other sound is dull and off-key.

The victim will become obsessed with the object, severing ties with everything and everybody else, and often becoming paranoid or violent over it.

- Newborn Deformities
 
Special: happens only when a new baby is born to all those around it.

The baby DOES NOT develop any problem. The plane can't do that. The baby is born perfectly fine and healthy. (To a degree, lack of sunlight and poor food usually are the real cause of physical problems in this case, and isolation can lead to inbreeding.)

It's everybody else that thinks the baby is deformed.

The mother may think his nose is strangely shaped, the wet nurse will notice a strange smell, the grandmother may find the baby too loud, or walking in a strange way. Others will think his hair is odd, or there is something wrong with his eyes.

None of that is true, it just appears that way, causing the baby to be isolated, shunned and uncomfortable around others. It strains relations between family members, causing endless discussions and generally ruining the mood for everybody. And because each person sees a different problem, nobody likes to talk about it openly, creating a very toxic atmosphere.

**Curing these afflictions**:  If one manages to leave the infected area, the effect will end in 1d6 days. They will then need at least 1 year of therapy with a professional and heavy medications for every month spent in Niflheim to attempt to fix all the regular mental problems the terrible experience caused them. 

**The monsters know:** Creatures native to the plane instinctively know what afflictions each person is suffering from, even if they don't know the precise details. They will do their best to exploit them. 

**Natural undeads**

Every intelligent creature that dies alone or by suicide will raise as undead after 24 hours. Unlike normal undeads they will be attracted specifically by their next of kin, lovers or best friends, and torment them instead of simply killing them.

Most become regular zombies (MM p.315), if they die in the fog they may become ghosts (MM p.147), shadows (MM p.269) or wraiths (MM p.302). If they die violently they can turn into wights (MM p.300) or ghasts (MM p.148).

Diary of Tom Longshoe, day 20

*Thigs went t' shit fast. One day Billford runs in town, says Old Man Fred farm's empty. All dead. Butchered like pigs. Some saw wolves on two legs. We took some people to go hunt, but found nothing but strange marks and smell o' piss. Merchant's not been comnig in town for a while, nobody can get to the count. Food's scarce. The earth seems like ash. Wife's even wanted to come with me huntin, we huddled in front of the campfire together, felt good for a while.*

----
----


**The locals - Sentient races**

The real monster is humanity. But the even realest monster is monsters, and these are the weird, evil and deranged creatures that have made this place their home, by far the most dangerous part of the plane.

**What does it mean to be a monster in Nilfheim?** Creatures in this plane are unique, in that they don't need food or water to live, but other people pain. Causing suffering sustains them, makes them feel warm, strong and happy. Not doing it makes them feel cold, miserable, heavy, and can lead to intense pain if not done for too long.

But never death. Only pain, until they manage to find something to hurt.

In a way, these creatures are also prisoners of the plane, all suffering from a very intense form of the sadism affliction.

Some creatures are smart enough to bide their time, using lies and trickery to hide their evil deeds and not expose themselves. Others act impulsively, simply trying to hurt anything they find, often ending up with a sharp object through their guts. 

Both types are dangerous in their own way and favour mental suffering, physical pain, or a combination of both. 

Some of these creatures feel bad about what they do, wrecked between the guilt of their actions and the happiness it gives them. Some would like to stop, if they had a way, others don't really care and see it as a simple physical need, more of a nuisance than anything. Others truly love it.

- **Hags**

Everybody knows the spooky grannies, so I won't spend much time on them. They're great villains, covenants are even better. You can find a ton of materials on them, Volo's guide, for example, has some pretty good stuff. Night Hags are the most common.

They're magical users that normally manipulate people to hurt or eat them, so you can imagine this plane just turns them to 11, enhancing their natural attitudes. 

- **Goblins of Hades**

A race of purple-skinned goblins that lives only in this plane and the material plane, around infected areas, they're quite different from regular goblins.

Much stronger and confident, Hade Goblins are confident trickster that use goblin stereotypes to their advantage. They appear weak, stupid and cowardly, making people lower their defences, and then strike viciously. 

They usually act alone or in groups from 2 to 6. They're vile and treacherous, so larger groups rapidly fall apart, and work together only to cause more mayhem.

In a village, they may start stealing things and harassing cattle, once they're comfortable with their victims may attempt murders, arson and kidnappings. If the find travellers, they'll attack them on sight if they appear weak or prepare a trap on the road if they seem strong. 

---
---
**Stat Block - Goblin Of Hades**

**AC** 12 **HP** 27 (8d8-1) **Skills:** Perception +4, Stealth +6, Deception +6

**STR**:8 **DEX**:16 **CON**:8 **INT**:12 **WIS**:8 **CHA**:14

**Damage resistance**: Acid, Cold.**

**attack:** **Claw** +5 (1d4+3) or Bite+2 (1d4-1)

**Special ability**: *Ooze attack*. 1/day As a standard action, the goblin secretes a gross, smelly purple substance from its body. This is a sentient ooze that lives symbiotically inside the goblin. The **Goblin Ooze** is small size with 10 **HP**, 9 **AC** and attacks by moving into an occupied space and dealing 1d4 cold damages each turn. (Range 0)

The ooze is Immune to acid and **vulnerable to fire** and will violently combust if hit by it, dealing **2d6 damages** to any creature in its space. Goblins often take advantage of this to burn people or houses. The ooze survives only 1 minute outside the goblin body.

**Spells**: At Will: Minor Illusion

---
---

- **Cinder Satyrs**

Legends say these grey-haired, red-eyed satyrs were once normal until their forest was contaminated by Hades and they lost their souls with it, or that their debauchery was so extreme and violent they were exiled from their people and ended up here. Whatever the case, they're relatively friendly creatures, even if vile and violent.

They are evil creatures, but love living an easy life and avoid getting hurt above everything. When they hurt something, it's usually small animals or people too weak to defend themselves. 

They also like to act friendly and get people drunk, giving them bad advice, and then watch them ruin their own lives. 
 
When meeting adventurers, they will try to avoid a fight with adulation and lies, offering them booze and information. If cornered, they prefer to be taken prisoners and enslaved than dying.

They still have parties, but they tend to be the ""get wasted and stop thinking about how much life sucks"" types of party, and not the ""wholesome campfire dancing"" party, but may act more-or-less friendly with anyone that wanted to join.

Other sylvan creatures despise them.

---
---

**Stat Block - Cinder Satyr**

Like a regular Satyr (Monster Manual page 267), with +38 HP (13 CON instead of 11), +6 Deception, +4 stealth, Resistance to Cold, can only use the Frightening Strain and not the Charming Lullaby. 

They're also able to produce a decent-tasting alcohol out of blood: After a 1hour ritual, they can wound a creature for 1d4 damage and drain 1lt of blood, that magically turns into 1lt of ""Satyr Brew"". They can do it to themselves if they run out of stuff to drink.   

---
---

- **Wolfman of the fog**

These humanoid wolves are evil, wretched creatures that hide in the fog, sometimes to cause people to get lost, other times just to kill. 

They are surprisingly smart and like to learn, usually from books found on their victims or studying nature. Sometimes they trade objects looted from their victims in exchange for books or knowledge.

A wolfman is around 2Mt tall when standing up, but tends to keep a hunched position that makes it look around 1.5Mt. It can also run on four legs. They are thin, with grey, black or brown fur.  They like to dress in clothes stolen from their victims, creating strange mismatches of styles and sizes. 

They are all genderless and live in tribes from 20 to 50 members, usually centred around a large shared library. They are individualistic and care for each other only because they're a source of information and protection. 

They generally see ""causing pain"" as a normal part of life, something you just gotta do. It's not pleasant, but it's unavoidable. Why make a big deal out of it? 

As a result, They may switch between trying to violently murder you to exchanging alchemical recipes, or stop gnawing off your arm to inquire on the symbol on your belt, or offer to release your half-devoured companion if you will show them the content of your bag. 

Many find this attitude very disturbing and creepy, but it's hard to hate them: they don't hold grudges, and for the standards of Niflheim, they're relatively good to have nearby. At least they keep goblins and beasts away. 

---
---

**Stat Block - Wolfman of the fog**

**Size**: Large; **AC** 15; **HP** 49 (9d8+9) **Speed**: 30ft walking, 40ft on 4 legs.

**STR**:15 **DEX**:13 **CON**:13 **INT**:16 **WIS**:12 **SWAGGER**:10

**Senses**: Darkvision

**Attack**: Multiattack 1 claw +4 (2d4+2) and 1 bite +4 (1d8+2). 

**Hiding in the fog** As a movement action, when inside thick fog, the Wolfman can turn into fog, the effect is identical to a combination of the spells *Gaseous Form* and *invisibility* but it lasts only 1 minute/day, divides in any way the wolfman wants. It also works only when it's inside the fog, and end as soon as he's removed from it.

**Vaste knowledge** The wolfman knows a lot about many things and has advantage on all Arcana, History, religion or Nature checks (if the knowledge is something they could reasonably know).

The also speak **4 additional languages**. 

---
---

- **Atropal**, the monstrous undead fetus thing, can in rare cases be found in this plane. I think the stats are in *Tomb of Annihilation*.


- **Any sentient creature found in the material plane**, but twisted by the plane. Bandits, elves, dryads, unicorns, giants, orcs, kobolds, anything that lived a regular life in the area before it was tainted is still there. Most of them will be driven mad, eventually, developing various affliction and becoming more violent than ever. 

 Bandits may start wearing black masks and collecting bones instead of coins, elves may become violently xenophobic or punish those that harm nature in excessive ways. Giants will develop strange cults and rituals, orcs will go on more frequent rampages. You can do anything you feel like with them.

- A plethora of **ghosts and other undeads**.

- Demons and Devils aplenty. They can travel to Niflheim from their native planes, and from there to infected areas in the material plane to torment people. They can't move from there to the regular material plane, so it's not an invasion path. 

You can also you Yugoloths, I guess, personally I never found them very interesting, they're just... demons lite.

---


**The locals - Non sentient races** 

- **Drowning Girl**

A type of amphibian, it looks like a regular human girl. It spends its time sitting on the edge of a river. When it notices humanoid creatures passing by, it walks in the water, pretending to be a girl attempting to down herself. 

If someone jumps in the water trying to save it, the creature attacks and attempts to eat them. They're not intelligent, but they are clever predators. 

**AC**:12 **HP** 19 (3d10+3) **Speed** 20ft, Swimming 30ft. 

**Skills**: Deception +4

Can hold its breath for 1 hour. 

When examined up close, it's nature is obvious. It looks like a girl only from a distance, possibly at night or in the fog. (**Deception check**  with disadvantage if the day is clear or the observer is at less than 30ft)

**Attacks** Bite+4 (1d8+2) and the target is **grappled**. Having arms and legs, it can grapple pretty well (Escape DC 13) and attempts to drown its victims. It is much stronger than an actual human girl. (STR 15)

- **Nightmare** (See Monster Manual Page 235 )

- **Achaierai** 

They're not in 5e, for some reason. 4-legged birds that are evil. Maybe I'll convert them later, but honestly, they're pretty boring creatures. Just use whatever large creature with a bite + claw attack and add **Black Cloud**

Up to three times per day an achaierai can release a choking, toxic black cloud.

Those other than achaierai within 10 feet instantly take 1d6 points of damage. They must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected for 1 Affliction of Nilfheim for the next day.

- **False Bear**

A bear that can imitate the voices of its victims, screaming for help or in pain to lure victims in the woods where he can maul them. (Inspired by the bear of similar powers in the 2018 movie Annihilation)

- Any normal animal found in the material plane, but they will all be emaciated, nervous, fearful, violent or skittish.  

- **Zombies**

---

**NPCs - The locals**

Some powerful forces live in Niflheim, traveling between their world and the material plane. When in our world, they are limited to the infected areas and can't easily leave to go spread their evil.

- **The weeping lich**

An old and powerful lich, he moved to Niflheim centuries ago looking for power. What it found was a prison that broke his mind and spirit.

Now, he lives alone in a rickety tower in the woods, his tormented cry heard all around. 

Because of the ""travelling"" nature of the plane, the tower isn't in any specific location: it could appear right next to your village, or you could find it hidden by the fog somewhere in the woods around it. 

The lich has forgotten his name and motive, and now simply wants a friend. He suffers from *Madness, Obsession* and *Paranoia*, so it's almost impossible for him to build strong relationships.

 Most people run away as soon as they see him, the few that stay will eventually be killed by him, and in extremely rare cases form a stable bond, if they are strong enough to survive his manic episodes.

**D6 - How's the lich acting today?**

1 - Extremely friendly and caring, trying his best to satisfy the needs of those around him, but he'll get angry if they don't do the same and act selfishly.

2 - Extremely sad, refusing to interact with people. If pressed, he'll become paranoid and assume his guests are trying to hurt him.

3 - Extremely bored, apathetic and silent. He'll just sit in his tower, looking at the woods. If someone asks something from him, he'll give it to them as long as it doesn't take too much effort. He sees no point in working to do anything. It all turns to dust, eventually.

4 - Extremely excited, he convinces himself Niflheim can be changed. His madness can be fixed, he can turn his life around. He'll be very friendly and excited, usually focusing on one task or idea with all of his energy, and be very enthusiastic about it. He'll make plans for the future and promise great things will come soon.

They never do. 

5 - Extremely scared, as a sense of impending doom falls on him. He'll assume everybody is secretly stronger than him or some unseen enemy is about to destroy him. He'll act like a scaredy cat and avoid conflict, while secretly planning a way to strike when his ""enemy"" less expects it.

6 - Extremely friendly. Same as above.

**Players interacting with the lich**

They will probably kill him, looting his tower for a great deal of materials and objects collected over the centuries. If they try to befriend him, they'll become part of a very toxic relationship, but possibly very rewarding, as the lich has a great deal of power and knowledge. If they get killed by him, he could be sad about it and resurrect them or turn them into undeads when his mood changes again.

If they can manage to get him out of the plane, they'll have found a lifelong and completely devout ally. This is no easy task, as nothing seems to work. Even a portal spell has failed, the lich couldn't walk through it. Maybe the solution lies in the past he has forgotten, hidden in the many tomes and trinkets that litter his tower.

**Stat block - Weeping Lich**

Use the stats of a regular lich (MM p.202) with these changes: He's been worn down by time and madness, and he's much weaker than a regular lich.

Only 14 Hit Dice for a total of 104 HP. 

Wisdom score of 10, Charisma score of 8. His spells have a save DC of 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks.

He knows only spells up to 7th level, and can't use any sort of plane shifting spell.

He cannot use the legendary action Disrupt Life, and the DC of frightening Gaze is only 16.

- **Lich servants**

(1D12+6) zombies act as ""guards"" for his tower. 1d4 *unseen servants* are cleaning or fixing the tower at all times. A group of Wolfmen has settled nearby, doing some work for him in exchange for knowledge, but their relationship is difficult and many wolfmen have considered betraying him.

**Lord James The Fifth** is an undead hamster, he used to be the lich pet a long time ago, when he was still alive. He killed him during one of his episodes and raised him as undead shortly after. Lord James is the object of the Lich Obsession, but it comes and goes. The lich kills it and brings it back every week or so.

It is the lich familiar.

**Gothay** is a Quasit that is tormenting the lich, trying to convince him to go murder and destroy all he can find, by telling him they have a way to cure his madness. Gothay has been with the lich for many years, and is considered a friend by him.

This is a lie, and Gothay only wants to cause mayhem. He's a regular Quasit, but owns a magical necklace that allows him to use the spell *Time Stop* once a day as a bonus action. With this, he's been able to survive the lich madness and is really hard to get rid of for any that wanted to befriend the lich.

The amulet works only for demons and was stolen from a much more powerful one that would really like to get it back. If a non-demon tries to use it, the necklace will work once and then lose its magic, breaking forever.

Pretends to be the lich familiar.

---

- **The Musician**

Born as Lady Selendele of Silverlake, this elven woman lived a remarkable and regular life for centuries. At some point, she abandoned her life and became a wandering bard. An evil bard.

Three hundred years later she roams Niflheim, spreading rumours, manipulating people to hate their parents or lovers or neighbours or simply breaking their morale with a very depressing song. It's not known why she's such a terrible person: her life is a web of lies and falsehoods since the only source on it is her own words.

Her bright clothes and apparently cheerful personality allow her to gain people trust easily.

She avoids combat as much as possible.

**Stat block - The musician** 

She's just a bard of a level appropriate for your party, with spells for deception, charm and escape. She could be carrying some object that gives away her true nature, like something she stole from a victim.

---

- **The queen of Niflheim**

A vampire warrior, she's lived in Niflheim for a long time and came to the conclusion everybody else is a weakling. She's decided to take over the entire plane and rule it as a just but strict queen. At least in her eyes. 

Her base of operation is a fort in a small Hamlet that got trapped in the plane around 50 years ago. She's enslaved the entire population, turning some into vampires and others into undeads, but leaving most of them alive as her subjects.

She has a man pretend to be the hamlet mayor, welcoming visitors for her. They'll get drugged and turned or enslaved, or sent away with a lie if they seem too dangerous. 

The population obviously doesn't like her, but they've learned to accept their situation. She's not a terrible leader, even if she requires regular blood donations, and she does keep them safe. Then again, many of them have developed afflictions so ruling over them isn't easy.

The queen is currently trying to expand her domain to nearby villages, avoiding to kill her future subjects if possible.

- **Fenja and Menja, the frost giantesses**

When a tribe of fire giants got trapped in a mountain pass infected by Niflheim, things didn't take long to go sour and the crazed giants butchered each other. 

Fenja and Menja were two sisters, frost giants slaves of the tribe chief. Thanks to the chaos, they managed to break free and easily overpowered the remaining, wounded fire giants. Now they formed a small warband that roams the plane, looking for a way out or a safe place to settle.

Individually, they're weaker than the fire giants, but fighting together they can overpower any of them, so they can keep order. The fire giants realize they wouldn't survive a week without them, so they more-or-less keep in line.

The giants are not stupid: They realize something unnatural has happened, and that some unseen force is trying to turn them mad, so they aren't aggressive and prefer to trade or work together with any humanoid race they meet. They know they don't have the knowledge to solve arcane problems, and are looking for a mage to help them.

If necessary or threatened, they have no problem killing to get what they want, and sometimes act violently.

Fenj suffers from *Paranoia* and relies on her sister to keep her mind at ease, 
Menja suffers from *Grey Sickness* and relies on her sister to keep her morale up. If they were separated, they would probably lose their marbles rapidly. 

They are two regular Frost Giants, leading a group of 6 fire giants (MM p.149).

Diary of Tom Longshoe, day 21

*Hell. We've got dragged in hell, by some curse or other. I'm sure. I tell the wife, she says it's none to worry abut. I know, is hell. The hunters gone and disappeared, the miller says someone's seen giants roaming 'round. Colder and colder every day, makes my bones hurt, head hurts, thinking is hard. Other people are getting crazy. Gone and hung' the priest, says he was the one that took the McKenzie daughters, did things to 'em I can't say. He says it was the only way to save us.*

**Religion**

Demonic cults are common in this plane, groups that remain isolated will be contacted by devils or demons and offered protection or a solution in exchange for sacrifices and worship.

Recently infected villages will keep their old religions but rapidly notice that their prayers don't seem to do much. Then again, clerics are very useful in this plane full of undeads and shadows, so as long as they are powerful enough to protect their flock they are guaranteed a lot of admiration and respect.

It is rumoured a temple of the Trickster God exists somewhere in this plane of lies, hidden in the fog, and offers a way out to anyone smart enough to find it.

**Traveling to Niflheim**

Most of the time, you don't go to Niflheim, Niflheim goes to you. The plane overlaps with the material one and spreads like a sickness. The players may accidentally wander into it while traversing a forest or mountain pass, or maybe start their adventure in it without realizing it.

Leaving, now that's hard. You can simply walk out of the infected area, but most of the time you will notice you ended up where you started. Landmarks aren't where they are supposed to be, and it's hard to find your direction in the dark, mist-covered woods.

The more the plane grows and the more time you spend in it, the harder it is to leave. Creatures that live in it for long enough can only leave through specific means or divine intervention. 

Once the infection is advanced, your piece of material plane is, in practice, overlapped with Hades so if you try to leave you will just end up in the Gray Wastes. It's effectively a one-way door from the material plane.

**Note**: Niflheim exists in multiple places in the prime material at once, and you can move from one to the other without even noticing: a forest near Waterdeep could get infected, people that live there try to escape, only to find themselves in an infected jungle in  Chult or a mountain pass in Thay. 

This also means that, if they escape, they may fInd themselves on the other side of the planet.

**Note 2**: It's impossible to invade the material by going through Niflheim, you'll be limited to the area infected and be unable to leave it, simply walking in circles.

**Plot Hooks and adventure ideas**

**Arrival**

- A player receives a letter from a family member talking about strange shadows and dying crops, asking for help. The players travel there but find the village has been taken over by a strange cult that keeps the fog at bay with human sacrifices.

- The players start their journey in a village. Their first few adventures show strange signs, and soon they realize something really bad is going on. They learn they have to move the village to a safe location before they're all trapped.

- The players are chasing or following someone through the country, and that person ends up in an infected area. They now have to jump in and try to find their target, but they seem to have disappeared in the fog. There are traces of orcs and hooves.

- Someone has heard of long-abandoned ruins in an isolated forest and sends the players to find something in them. The place is infected by Niflheim and is being ravaged by a conflict between the Vampire Queen and a demon that took up residence in the temple.


**While already inside Niflheim**

- the players meet a travelling merchant. He got in a wild party with some satyrs and woke up naked, all his possessions stolen and his daughter disappeared. He begs the players to save her. But when they investigate, the story may be much more complicated than what it seems, and the daughter is no daughter at all. 

- A village is slowly dying and is gone full Salem. People accuse witches of being the reason for their problems, not knowing what Niflheim is, and the mayor has declared himself supreme inquisitor. Many innocents have already died. The truth is the mayor suffers from *Kleptomania*, and uses his power to steal random objects from his victims.

- A devil approaches the players, saying he has a way out of the plane if they will do something for him. It's apparently a harmless task.

- A group of elves was following a criminal when they both got trapped in Niflheim. They're obsessed with vengeance, but the criminal found shelter in a group of bugbears (it is a shapeshifter). The elves are ready to die all storming the camp if they can manage to kill their target in the chaos.  

- A massive slug has appeared in the lake and seems to have absorbed all of the water, leaving the nearby village to die. People rapidly noticed they can cut out pieces of the slug flesh and it's filled with water. clear, refreshing water.

 Some are afraid drinking it will cause terrible things to happen they say, but it's their only source of water. Others are already drinking it. The village is split and tension mounts. Where does the slug come from? Is it really dangerous? Can it be removed? Who's the two-headed man that has been seen sneaking in the village at night? ",1,"The Gray Waste of Hades - Niflheim, the bleak gorge"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,36,"I have been running a campaign for about 2 years now based in a setting that is essentially Pirates of the Caribbean meets the colonial era meets steampunk meets Raiders of the Lost Ark. I was wondering what the interest would be if I were to post more about this setting.

The Galbeshi Archipelago is set in the world of Etann. Magic is not uncommon but by no means widespread. Empires rise and fall, and there are many ancient civilizations with long-lost ruins scattered across the world.

**History:** 

The Galbeshi archipelago is a series of tropical islands once home to an ancient gith civilization. They abandoned their cities long ago due to some unknown disaster, and since then have reverted to living in small coastal fishing villages far from their old cities. The gith share the islands with lizard folk, trolls and other such jungle creatures. 

About 250 years ago, Kalnori (Keloran is an empire themed off of north-western Europe) ships from the continent of Myrn sailed into the archipelago. Shortly after contacting indigenous gith populations, Kalnori prospectors discovered a new mineral under the islands: kyrum. Kyrum floats when exposed to air, allowing for the creation of airships. Fast forward to the present era and the archipelago is teeming with kyrum-powered airships. The Kalnori kyrum mines in the north-west of the archipelago were soon rivaled by Ma'Si (an empire themes off of the Iberian Peninsula) mines to the north-east. 

The two empires, while not technically at war, battle in the political arena for control over the archipelago and its valuable resources. Tensions are not helped by the fact that on Myrn, the empires share a border and have gone to war in the past. What is more, the archipelago is located between the continent of Myrn to the north, Otu Oganye to the south, and Kyo So to the east. Whoever controls the archipelago controls the Etann's most central trade hub. 

To complicate matters further, the Ma'Si Empire is the seat of the Church of Allmere, a religion founded around a supernatural, demigod-like martyr who died some 1500 years ago. The church is incredibly powerful, however its influence is faltering. Ancient prophecies of the church speak of an apocalyptic event that will call for a reincarnation of Allmere to come and lead civilization to a new Utopian era from the darkness. The prophecies called for this event to have happened about 75 years ago. Belief in the church is faltering, and swaths of people are converting to new, more stable religions. The church has thus began covert operations, sending agents out in search of something that could bring about an artificial apocalypse or cataclysmic event so that people will begin to believe in the church again. The church of Allmere will stop at nothing in its search for a way to force the prophecy to come true. Rumors have it that the church is pursuing ancient gith legends of some horrible entity locked away underneath one of their ruined cities. 

Furthermore, the massive amounts of trade that flow through the Galbeshi and its many uncharted islands are a perfect recipe for pirates! Pirate airships prowl the skies, seeking refuge in secret outlaw port-towns scattered across the archipelago. 

Much of the archipelago remains uncharted by all but the gith. Tales of crashed sky cities and sunken civilizations that pre-date even the gith are abound. Was there a species that existed before humans ever walked the earth that lived here? What happened to them? Maybe their disappearance has something to do with rumors that the earth is hollow, and the entrance is found somewhere within the archipelago. 

**Adventure Hooks** 

The archipelago is full of adventure ideas: 

* The players may be pirates, starting as lowly bandits and eventually working their way up to purchasing airships and commanding a pirate fleet. Perhaps they will even buy their own island, or manage to get an ancient floating island back into the sky. 
* They may be buccaneers or mercenaries working for the Kalnori to secure shipping lanes from pirates and defend against the encroachments of the Ma'Si
* They may be working against the Church of Allmere, attempting to uncover its diabolical plot with help from the mysterious Silent League. 
* They may be part of the gith liberation front, seeking an independent, sovereign archipelago free from the influences of the Kalnori and Ma'Si. This requires guerrilla fighting against colonial empires, using ancient gith knowledge and secrets to aid the struggle for independence. 
* The players might be adventurers, seeking to uncover ancient ruins, fantastical natural wonders, and rare ingredients or trophies that are sought by merchants far and wide. 

Politics, mystery, adventure, swashbuckling, intrigue, piracy, horror, grit, and many more themes have a home in the Galbeshi archipelago. 

**Adventurers** 

I find that the setting's cosmopolitan nature encourages rarer characters that people would not otherwise try. Gith, thri-kreen and kenku are not unheard of in the region, and each have substantial populations in the many port cities. Gnomish artificers may tinker on new, upgraded airship engines while thri-kreen barbarians ride into battle atop wyverns. Even those bizarre 4E races from the 2nd and 3rd PHB may make an appearance in the archipelago: arikokra, goliaths, shardminds, minotaurs and more. 

**Technology and Magic** 

Airships run on kyrum engines, which use the crystal to levitate the ships. Regulating mechanisms control how much buoyancy a ship has. Airships resemble classical sailing ships, except they have side sails and bottom sails. They may also use steam engines for propulsion when sails are retracted. 

Handheld guns are non-existent because in Etann, black powder burns incredibly hot and will melt most metals in the explosion. Thus, only large, reinforced cannons are possible using firearm technology. These cannons often misfire or melt, and are incredibly heavy. This greatly limits the amount of cannons an airship can carry at any given time. That being said, all manner of repeating crossbows, compound bows and even automatic crossbow turrets may be found in the artificer workshops of major cities. 

Kytes are hang-gliders that use a miniature kyrum rod engine to allow them upwards movement. They also have repeating crossbows mounted on them, and can engage in spectacular areal dogfights during airship battles. 

Tazer swords, grappling hook launchers, magical spy-glasses, ancient crystal blades, time-warping stones, and steampunk jet packs are some of the other items that have appeared in my campaigns in the Galbeshi. It is a strange setting- an artificer and necromancer can get together and revive a dead dinosaur and strap flamethrowers and armor to it and it doesn't seem too outlandish given context (this has happened several times). 

**Notable Locales** 

A hollow island formed from the skull of a dead god that has formed an entirely new ecosystem inside its magic decaying brain-matter, a city built around a colossal lighthouse that pre-dated any known civilization, a city built onto a massive sea stack jutting out of the ocean, and a crater island home to an ancient prison-temple.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,30,"###***Helios - Light of The Law***

***Panther’s Note-*** This began as a reinterpretation of Lathander, and a writeup of how Lathander is depicted in my setting. However, by the time I got done with this, it basically looked just like Aumanator, and nothing like Lathander. I got a lot of flak when I did this with Pelor, so I decided to just sidestep the issue and call him something completely different. If you’re following my Church of the Light entries, this is basically my Lathander. 


[Google Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vgMFn9UJjtk8ZkjjWK2TF8a8bXOCsfiifxeEte1MkxU)


This is deity 4/6 in my Church of The Light series, intended to make a polytheistic religion that is superficially similar to pre-modern Christianity. 

##***Names***

Helios, The Light of Law, The Sun’s Fury, The 3rd Ray.

##***Appearance and Symbols***

Classical depictions of Helios show a warrior with white-blonde hair, wearing a white linen shendyt and a solar crown. However, as the Church of Light has evolved, depictions of Helios have moved away from assigning a lowly mortal form to The Light of Law. Modern depictions are allegorical; the symbol of the 3rd ray of the holy sun is most commonly used. Helios' personal symbol is a golden eagle gripping a sheaf of arrows. The especially devout of Helios, who have survived his trial, wear golden masks that depict his face.

Helios is seen as the embodiment of adherence to The Law. His light shines brightest when The Law is adhered to, and when it is administered. He is a patron of civilization and order. Helios does not consider what the spirit or intention of the law is; Helios cares purely about adherence to the Letter of the Law. 


##***Origin***

As with my other deities of Light, Helios is a son of “He-Who-Was”. Helios holds a bitter hatred for Asmodeus, Dispater and Zariel for the treachery they committed against his father. He thirsts for vengeance against Asmodeus, and looks forward to a time when Pelor will allow him to be unleashed against Asmodeus, and those who have sworn themselves to him.

###***Domain***

Righteous Anger, Adherence to The Law, Punishment of the Wicked, Protection of the Weak, Order, Martial Prowess, and Military Strength.


##***Tenets***

The Law of Helios is a large body of laws and punishments that describe how a righteous individual should behave. Most of Helios' more nuanced laws are not known to everyday folk. The bare bones of Helios' Law should be fairly well-known, and codified as part of the local social mores.

In lands where The Pantheon of Light are the chief deities, Helios' Law forms the basis of the legal system. The basics of Helios' Law can, and should, be tweaked to suit your own setting. However, I wrote the main tenets of Helios with the idea that “The Law” is not unlike The Pentateuch. If you like, you can boil Helios' Law down to something similar to The Ten Commandments.



- Adherence to The Law is the path to righteousness.
- Those who are righteous have no fear of the Light of the Law. 
- Those who do not embrace The Law, must be illuminated.
- The Righteous must not suffer any of The Wicked to be left in darkness.
- Punishment within the bounds of The Law will bring The Wicked into The Light.
- Those who have abused the mercy of Ilmater are to be thrice punished. Once to satisfy their original crime, once to satisfy the lie that they swore before Ilmater, and once to satisfy the fury of Helios.
- Ignorance is no defense for The Wicked.
- All that evil requires is the inaction of The Righteous.
- Helios is the Light and the Will of The Law. Just as no celestial star may outshine The Sun, no Lord may consider himself above The Law.




##***Dogma***

Helios is the Light of The Law, and he permits no secrets where his light shines. Helios' dogma are his tenets.

Helios is a God who inspires great zeal and passion from his adherents. Helios' closest adherents are judges, guards, soldiers and legal inquisitors. A true adherent of Helios will zealously guard The Law, and will not permit anyone to sully their own soul by breaking The Law. 

Where a priest of Ilmater or Pelor might counsel a dear friend against petty thievery, and secretly pay back a merchant who was targeted, a priest of Helios would not hesitate to physically prevent their friend from committing any legal indiscretions, or even call a town guard over to arrest their companion. Helios has a zero-tolerance attitude with regard to corruption within the ranks of his faithful. Priests and paladins of Helios are infamous for zeal in enforcing the will of their Lord. On that same turn, law enforcement officials who are familiar with Helios will act with reverence and deference towards a priest or paladin of Helios. Priests and paladins of Helios are simultaneously revered and feared for their strict enforcement of Helios' Law. 


As one might imagine, Asmodeus particularly delights in corrupting one of Helios' faithful. The Lord of Baator enjoys watching a good hypocrite fall, and will often personally handle the temptation of a highly-ranked member of Helios' faithful. The rare individuals who withstand Asmodeus’ temptation are recognized and marked by Helios. 

Those few among Helios' faithful who have withstood Asmodeus’ temptation are given the title “Archon”. An Archon is a being who is truly incorruptible; they are the physical manifestation of The Law itself, and they are a living avatar of Helios' will. An Archon’s appearance will take on a decidedly celestial flavor; their eyes may shine with divine light, or they may appear to have a faint glow of golden wings upon their back. Helios' Archons do not die; they are considered to have ascended to dwell at Helios' side for all time. 

Those who fail temptation from Asmodeus are swiftly, publicly and thoroughly dealt with by Helios, or one of his ascended Archons.

##***Allies of the Faith***

Helios is closely allied with his kin, the other deities of the Church of the Light.

[***Pelor, Lord of the Sun and Sky -***](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9sqa94/pelor_lord_of_the_sun_and_sky/) While Helios is deferential to his elder brother's leadership, he believes that Pelor ought to hold his faithful to the high standard that Helios' own clerics are held to. Helios' priests and paladins will happily enforce Pelor’s tenets alongside Helios' own tenets. 

[***Nuada, Light of the Elves -***](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9twj0l/prince_nuada_aergethlam_light_of_the_elves/) Helios is Nuada’s great-uncle, and he is the one who trained Nuada in the martial arts. Helios approves of Nuada’s vigilance, as well as Nuada’s philosophy of physical and mental perfection for The Elves. Although Nuada is significantly less rigid than Helios, the two congregations are usually quite able to agree to disagree on smaller matters, and get along quite well. 

[***Ilmater, The Patient Lord -***](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a0kewz/ilmater_the_patient_lord/) Ilmater and Helios' faithful often work quite closely together. Ilmater’s priests seek righteousness by bearing the brunt of punishments meant for criminals, and Helios' faithful deal those punishments out. However, Helios holds a special fury for those who would falsely claim the mercy of Ilmater’s priests. Those who have lied in order to convince a priest of Ilmater to take on their punishment can be certain that Helios' burning gaze will fall upon them.

***Aurora, Lady of Rainbows -*** Aurora is the Lady of Rainbows and Beauty, the Spirit of Hope and the Guardian of Children. There is very little overlap between Aurora and Helios' worshippers, except on nights when Aurora is said to ferry the unresting spirits of children away. It is said that Helios and his Archons guard the way for Aurora, and her entourage of restless spirits.


***Eldatha, Lady of Healing -*** Of all the members of the Solar Family, Eldatha and Helios have the most contention between them. Eldatha, being the Lady of Healing and Mercy, does not approve of Helios' uncompromising nature. Helios, in return, dislikes Eldatha’s imperious attitude whenever her doctors and his guards come into conflict with one another. Physicians who have sworn Eldatha’s Oath of Service cannot turn away someone who is in mortal need of healing. However, short of that mortal, dire need, a physician-priest of Eldatha may choose not to treat one who is in service to Helios. In return, the Physician-Priests of Eldatha never seek the aid of those under Helios, or stay at his temples.


Besides his kindred within The Solar Family, Helios considers himself an ally of any and every Lawful Neutral or Lawful Good deity, despite The Church of the Light’s position that only “Flesh of the Light” are suitable for worship. Helios considers himself especially friendly towards Bahamut.

##***Enemies of the Faith***

Any and all Chaotic or Evil deities are considered enemies of Helios. However, Asmodeus and his two lieutenants, Zariel and Dispater, are especially his enemies. Helios' heart still burns with hatred for Asmodeus and the treachery that he brought to Helios' father, “He-Who-Was”.

Helios harbors some amount of ill will towards The Seldarine, and especially Corellon Larethian and Orpheus Latonides. 

Corellon and Orpheus conspired together to seduce Aurora away from her guardian’s watchful gaze, and ran off with her into the wilds. When Helios caught up with the fleeing elves, Orpheus took the form of Aurora and allowed himself to be captured. By the time Helios discovered the trick, Corellon had already escaped with Aurora. Helios dislikes being reminded how he failed Pelor by allowing Corellon to escape with Aurora, and he dislikes the Elven Gods who played him for a fool. In Helios' mind, the only decent Elven God is his nephew, Nuada Aergethlam. 

Helios has a hateful respect for Mephistopheles. Although Helios has an innate hatred for the Evil Lord of Cania, he begrudgingly respects Mephistopheles’ role as a lawyer and a God of Order.

[Link for Mephistopheles](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/97ofuk/mephistopheles_devil_of_contracts_lawyers_and/)

##***Clergy and Temples***

Helios' priests are often inquisitors, mage hunters and legal scholars. They administer The Law without prejudice, mercy or malice. In places that are remote, or far away from a proper courthouse of Helios, a priest may conduct a roadside trial. 

Those who administer Helios' Justice are enthusiastic about The Law itself, but it is intended that punishments are meted out without passion or zeal. As one might expect, the clergy of Helios are excessively judgemental with regard to each other. Each member of Helios' clergy must fervently maintain an unclouded judgement. It does not matter who the individual may be, all are to be held accountable to each other for false administration of The Law. 

Although Helios is a God who loathes secrecy, he does permit certain members of his clergy to undergo a trial that strips the individual of their racial and national identity, and marks them as one of Helios' Own. The Trial of The Mask is a a painful, introspective ritual wherein the would-be judge confesses a litany of every “crime” they have ever committed against Helios' Law, and receives divine punishment for each one of these crimes. If the individual fails to confess any crime against Helios' Law, they are summarily executed by an Archon, or Helios himself.

If an individual passes through Helios' Trial, their race, origin, and former identity are washed away. They are granted a new name and racial identity, and a golden mask of Helios' face. The mask is not meant to conceal the identity of the wearer, but rather, to remind the wearer that their previous identity is gone forever. A member of Helios' Own is never to reveal their face, unless dire circumstances demand it.

For DMs, if you have a player who wishes to undergo Helios' Trial, devise a series of Insight, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Investigation and Arcana checks to see if their character is capable of


- Perfectly recalling Helios' Law.
- Perfectly recalling every “sin” they have ever committed against that law.
- Enduring the Divine Punishment that Helios visits upon them.
- Surviving the ""transformation"".

If your player succeeds, their race will be replaced with that of a Scourge Aasimar. Their previous racial talents and abilities will be replaced by that which are granted to the Scourge Aasimar. Additionally, grant your player either training or expertise in Insight, and an additional +1 to Wis. To use their *Radiant Consumption* ability, they must remove their Golden Mask of Helios, which is otherwise NEVER to be taken off. Although not required, the player’s golden mask should become their Holy Symbol. 

If you have a player who survives Helios' trial, you may eventually present some temptation from Asmodeus or Mephistopheles. If your player survives this trial to become an Archon, they should gain a passive ability wherein they innately sense when an individual is lying to them. (Up to you to decide how this conflicts with a Rogue Mastermind’s abilities).


Temples of Helios are courthouses. Trials are performed, criminals are punished. Resident judges, lawyers and priests of Helios are permitted sparse rooms in the upper floors of the temples. Lower levels of Helios' temples are dungeons, where criminals await trial. Extensive court records are also kept in the labyrinthine basements. Accommodations for Ilmater’s traveling priests are well maintained, and usually much more comfortable than those afforded to Helios' faithful.

Most temples of Helios will have shrines to the local Archon, or to an Archon that is otherwise strongly identified with the area. Most temples to Helios also contain a large, communal urn where the ashes of martyrs are mixed together. Guards who have fallen in the line of duty, judges who have been assassinated, and Faithful who failed to survive Helios' trial, are all committed to these urns. 

##***Holidays and Festivals***

The Law does not rest, and The Law holds no holiday. Even during Pelor’s fast, and the subsequent feasting at his return from Baator, Helios' faithful do not celebrate.


##***Champions and Avatars***

It is written that the Champions of The Law are all who uphold it. More specifically though, Helios' main avatars are his Archons, who can be likened to angels, and those who have undergone The Trial of The Mask.

It is widely believed that a masked Cleric or Paladin of Helios can innately sense if a person is lying to them. Although this is not strictly true, it is usually very unwise to lie to a member of Helios' clergy, especially one of his masked judges.

An Archon of Helios might initially appear like one of Helios' Masked, but their higher purpose is usually apparent fairly quickly. Helios deploys his Archons in situations of dire need, or when adherents of Asmodeus dare to show their faces during the daytime. 
Known Sects and Cults

Heresy within Helios' church is vigorously pursued by certain inquisitors. There are those who believe it is their sole purpose to travel from courthouse to courthouse, and root out any corruption that may be found. Helios' inquisitors are usually Masked Paladins who are permitted to set aside their masks for the purposes of internal investigation into the actions of a courthouse.

Helios' courthouses maintain extensive collections of records, for the purpose of allowing inquisitor review. Trends in judgements; handing out differing punishments to one class of individual over another, or any other sort impropriety, is mercilessly punished.

The enthusiastic punishment of heresy within Helios' ranks has allowed for an uncommonly united philosophy within his church.

# BTS tell me about the narrative hooks found in the City of Gandahar!",1,City of Gandahar: Plot Hooks Megathread
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,95,482,"Hey all! First time posting here. Over in r/DMAcademy, someone asked about the correct way to handle called shots. I left a (lengthy) comment with my thoughts, solutions, and opinions, and someone suggested I repost my answer here for other DM's. Hopefully it's appropriate for this group, I read the rules and don't think it violates any rules.

The OP asked how to handle called shots, as the players liked to perform them. Up to this point he or she had been adding extra AC to the attacks, and was wondering if this was the correct method. This is my reply:

(Thanks to u/MountainDewPoint for the suggestion.)

==========

TL;DR: In short, yes, adding AC to make it more difficult is a correct solution. The smaller the body part, the higher the AC should be.

\----------

Now for the longer answer:

This depends on which system you're using, but there are some common rules that carry over all systems, and as DM you're free to modify the rules to suit your needs.

5e doesn't provide rules for this situation (to the best of my knowledge). 5e is a simplified or watered-down version of DnD, so these intricate rules aren't really spelled out. But you basically have five options: No Called Shots, Cinematic Only, Disadvantage, Increase in AC, or a combination of both.

\----------

Method 1: No Called Shots

Simply put, don't allow them. I disagree with this method, and discuss this later.

\----------

Method 2: Cinematic Only

As mentioned elsewhere here by another user, only allow them in certain situations, such as the completion of a battle, or a particularly descriptive or epic attack.

\----------

Method 3: Disadvantage

The simplest solution is to allow the called shot, but at a disadvantage. Simple. Straight forward. And easy to use.

\----------

Method 4: Increase in AC

A more complex, but more accurate (and arguably more satisfactory) method is to increase the AC needed for the called shot.

Despite what others are saying, DnD does provide rules for called shots. However, off the top of my head, I couldn't say which version or book contains the rules. I'm pretty sure it's in the DM's manual somewhere in a previous system, but I'm moving and all my books are packed, so I'm running off my memory here. (A quick google search reveals that 3.5 has some nice charts.)

Basically, all creatures have a size category. Humans are sized Medium, and have a +0 to their AC for being medium size. Humans are the standard, so everything is relative to their size.

For each category smaller than a human, a creature gets a bonus to their AC. Small creatures have a +1, and Tiny +2, Diminutive +4, and Fine +8.

For each category larger than a human, a creature gets a penalty to their AC. Large creatures have a -1, Huge -2, Gargantuan -4, and Colossal and larger get -8.

Now, AC listed for a NPC, monster, or even your PC's reflects the armor of target mass, which means the torso or largest body part, as this is the largest and easiest part of a creature to hit. So an Orc with a 16 AC means, you need to roll a 16 to hit his chest/torso.

In order to hit a body part smaller than his torso, you need to decide how much smaller that body part is from his torso, and apply a bonus to the AC for that body part. This reflects the difficulty in hitting something smaller.

For example, suppose the player wants to hit the arm. You decide that's one size smaller than the torso, so the AC is at a +1. If the player wants to hit the hand, you decide that's a size tiny, so +2. Now the player wants to hit the trigger finger, so that's a diminutive, so +4 to AC. And finally, he wants to take off just the tip of the finger, and nothing else. That's a fine size, so +8 to AC.

Take out an eye? Compared to the torso, that might be Tiny or Diminutive, so +2 or +4 (your call).

Shoot the cigarette out of someone's mouth? Diminutive or fine, so +4 or +8.

Now, this still applies to creatures larger than a human. If the players are fighting an adult dragon, you need to decide how much smaller than it's main body the eyes are. Yes, the eyes of an adult dragon are still much larger than a human's eyes, but compared to the rest of the body, they're still smaller. So, look up what size the Dragon is, and just count backwards until you decide the size of the eyes, and adjust the AC to fit.

Here's a chart to reference from 3.5e: [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Table\_of\_Creature\_Size\_and\_Scale](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Table_of_Creature_Size_and_Scale)

\----------

Method 5: Combination of 3 &amp; 4

This option is a combination of the two previous methods mentioned above. Determine the AC of the target body part, and let the player attack it at a disadvantage.

Re-Post Edit: More detailed rules on this method (including called shot saving throws) are described in ""Fighter Folio"" (c) 2018 by Total Party Kill Games (I have no connection with them, it's just one source I saw this method in.)

\----------

Now, to address whether or not you should allow called shots, that's really up to you as DM. However, my opinion (which you are not required to take or follow) is that by denying your players an action that any reasonable person could perform (successful or not) in real life diminishes the game, takes away from their sense of adventure, and overall ruins their experience. And stings slightly of railroading. (IMO) I play these types of games because it allows me to do things I wouldn't normally do, or have the ability to do. (I'm shit with a bow, but love archer classes.)

For me, one of the best things about playing or hosting a game is to create a puzzle and see how the players overcome it. Then adapt based on your experiences. Learning to adapt and anticipate your players actions makes you a better DM. Outright denying them things means you won't learn and grow as you won't be challenged.

Now, that's not to say you should just give them a chest of gold because they asked for it. But if your players set a goal, work hard, and knock over a bank? Well, then they deserve that chest of gold, even if that means they ruined the adventure you had set up.

What can you do then? Quit. Or learn and adapt. Ok, sure, they've got a chest of gold. But where will they spend it when wanted posters are plastered everywhere. And bounty hunters are after them. You may have had an amazing adventure planned out, but you never know what amazing adventures your players will lead YOU on by running off the track to follow their own destinies.

As to the issues of players always shooting out the eyes... that's what helmets are designed for. Players calls a shot to the eye? Ok. Diminutive size, so +4 to AC... oh wait! He's wearing a steel helmet! That's an additional +2 to the AC. Not so easy a shot, is it?

Now they're facing bad guys with full plate helmets. Monks that deflect arrows. Or spell casters who won't let them close the distance. (There are many good spells that can keep combat at range.) Or, now the bad guys know the players like to take out eyes, so they guard their eyes more efficiently now. You could decide they get a standard +2 to AC for simply watching and anticipating a called shot to the eyes. (Don't overuse this though. Players should feel that called shots are a valid tactic.)

Learn their tactics, and adapt your monsters to overcome those tactics. Not all monsters. Goblins will still be dumb and rush in. They're cannon fodder. But the villains, they're smart. They'll learn from the players and adapt their armies to compensate. Not every adversary will adapt to the players. But enough should so that the players learn that their tactics are becoming common knowledge among their enemies. (Maybe they earn a reputation for taking out eyes? This could spread into a rumor that they eat them, or collect them, or something.)

In the end, what you decide to do as a DM is your choice. You've got a lot of feedback here and hopefully will provide an amazing adventure for your players.

\----------

One final thought, there are systems, books, and rules out there about what happens after a called shot. From blindness, to massive damage, to loss of the use of limbs. Consider these consequences when allowing called shots. If a villain takes an arrow to the knee, he should be hobbling around after that, and have a penalty to his movement. Dagger to the hand? He shouldn't be able to hold anything in that hand until healed. Villain loses an eye? Ok, he's now partially blind and takes penalties to his attacks... but, if he escapes, he could have it healed... or replaced with a magic item/artifact that gives him new and deadly abilities for the next time he faces the players. Explore the possibilities! :D

Good luck!",1,Called Shots: Methods and Repercussions
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,140,"So I had an AMA the other day, and I promised to make it into a dungeon. I wasn't worried. Still am not. BUT I thought maybe there would be some people who would benefit from seeing my process. So let's do this. 

STEP ONE
---
[I've made a list of every username that had a question for me](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ssibbo8SP_-acaRErCCQDlSYXolqQV2yG92E6WPYf2Q/edit?usp=sharing). There are over 200. That is twice as big as any megadungeon I've ever made. So step one will be to just do 50. I'll try to do 50 a day for the next week and get all the ideas for the room down. That's the big first step. *Ideally* I can run the whole dungeon just with that. But I want to make it easy to run for most people, so we'll go further after that. 

STEP TWO
---
Basic groundwork. Part of my process is to just go. Just start writing and see what comes out. Stephen King does this. He calls it ""discovery"". He likened it to sitting around a campfire as one by one people come up and tell their story. He also likens it to digging up a house. But I like the campfire. 

So that's what I did. 

Here's what I got so far...

**The Castle of the Sun King**
--
Not gonna lie to you guys. I had this idea before. Here's what I had written down in my notes that I was looking over while writing this. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
*A castle once stood in a second sun, low on the horizon. Then the king stole the sun and plunged the castle into a sea of darkness. Blindfold a lighthouse and sail out from it until the water bleeds into shadow and feels like fog to your hands. Use your torches and lamps to find the lone tower that icebergs from the depths, secure your boat, and be brave.* 

*Rumored to be inside is the Endless Sleep, The Lantern of Alienation, Melancholic, and other legendary artifacts from the kingdom.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So I saw this idea and I thought: ""Hey, I could make this dungeon the AMA dungeon!"" and then, with that in mind, it helped focus my brain on a singular concept. 

With that, I learned a few things about this dungeon through this initial writing:

* The Sun King is some kind of Dark Souls-esque asshole.
* The castle is sunk to the bottom of the ocean floor, which is this weird, other-world of inky, black smoke. 
* This ink stains people. Stained people have lost their humanity and are mad.
* There are these things in my world known as the Pieces of the Sun, which are literal bits of a sun. These pieces protect you from the effects of this dungeon. 
* There is a being known as the Phoenix that is very important to this ""lore""/place.
* This dungeon is as much a social dungeon as it is a combat dungeon. I think there are only 2-4 *only* fighting encounters.

I like this so far. It lets me be weird but also fit into a theme. So okay. Step one was the list. Step two was the groundwork. Next is...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP THREE
---

The first 50 rooms... *(there's gonna be a lot of spelling mistakes. I write initial drafts in notepad)*

1. A Ninja rests here. He's the last unstained of the Sun King's men. He's exhausted and on his last leg of life. He will offer assistance but will be stained upon return.
1. Globs of shadow cling to the roof. They drip, revealing their presence. They fall when light passes beneath them. Their shadow splashes out in tendrils to hit other targets.
1. A maiden is locked up here. Her name if Deffany, daughter of the Sun King. Her geese (idk how many yet) are wandering the halls. Return them to her and she will offer reward. A goose sheds continual light here. And they lay golden eggs.
1. Reproductive room. This room is infused with sexual energy. No fighting can occur here, so it's technically safe. There's a blood dryad here, living in the corpse of a monster. Drink the blood and she will love/be with you forever.
1. Open to the outside. These tall, mahogany trees raise up into the inky shadows around. There are ink sharks and other things lurking here. 
1. Stained NPC - Guin is a very haughty, very noble fighter. Young. Kinda dumb. He is trying to prove himself to the King by taking on increasingly deadly challenges.
1. Stained Encounter - Jacole was a seamstress until she was stained. Now her 13 shadows stitch people into her body so she may grow large and full.
1. This room has one of the geese in it. It's in a cage with a sheet tossed over it. A stained creature is preparing it for dinner but can't look at it directly so is trying to find sunglasses.
1. A door bars passage to the next chamber. A stained NPC sits cris-cross-applesauce on the floor, constantly chewing on something. When approached he holds out his hand and says ""Cheap. Nuts.""
1. Yashtooky is a warrior for the Sun King, clinging on to sanity. He refuses to admit that he is stained as he rounds up other stains from around the castle and brings them here to be executed.
1. Sir Strand is a Half-Elven knight. He doesn't remember how long he's been here, he only knows to keep the fire going. If you offer something to keep the fire burning, and tell a story, he will let you sleep here. If the fire goes out, he will be stained and grow two more sets of limbs, standing 9' tall, with an unhinged jaw filled with dagger-teeth.
1. Sentient Storm Blade is plunged into stone. Only when struck by lightning can it be removed. 1/week it can change the weather entirely. Sunny, cloudy, rainy, stormy, snowy, etc. It's a +1 blade.
1. There's a stained man here looking for his waffles. Waffles is his ""cat"" he says. But when he shows you a picture, it's his son. He sobs. His wailing summons the Ink Bird, which will be put on the encounter table until defeated or the son is returned. 
1. This rolling machine has found a home here. Brought here some time ago, its owner/creator stained and lost in the castle somewhere. It's taken on the mantle of cataloging everything in the Castle. It will catalog you and, if given some token, can ""store"" you in another room. It may do this at random as well.
1. Another breeding chamber. Empty. Safe.
1. Cartographer's Lair. Jyneath, the mapmaker, sits painting maps to nonexistant worlds. For coin and all your memories about a place, he can paint you a map to it. He can also paint a map to a future place. Or a metaphorical place.
1. This room is circular and make of stary-stoned walls, smooth and ice cold. There's faint music playing here and the floor is covered in a million flowers. In the center there is a well that looks out into space. Drop a flower in and something happens. 
1. An Unseelie fox dens in this room. If it's there it will hide. It knows its pelt is expensive and sought after.
1. A stained set of Elven statues. One heals and one damages but both must be activated at the same time. 
1. A stained door that will only open to a simile. The simile must be about you (""I am as brave as a lion"") and the simile will become literal (you will turn into a lion).
1. Throne of the Ninodon lord, lesser lord under the King of the Sun. Sitting on the throne shows you where he is. There are Throne Dryads here that are his daughters.
1. A collection of nice fantasy books. They're quite nice to read. There's a few tarantulas that are living here. They have Rorschach patterns on their bodies which can communicate with you.
1. Guin is here as well (if still alive). He's trying another crazy scheme.
1. The main room that holds the teddy bombs. These mimic-like creatures are created from the stained girl that stays here. She can only be defeated here. When defeated the teddy's will be taken off the encounter table. 
1. This man sits at a crossroads of the castle. He ""protects"" the lamp post of all lamp posts. If a spell slot if given to the lamp it gives you a new spell (idk yet). He himself is very inquisitive and trades questions for questions.
1. A self-proclaimed King. It's just a teenage boy. He calls everyone ""turds"" and just wants them to do degrading things.
1. This giant centipede creature crawls on the walls and calls all of its prey ""Milkshakes"". And it will drink you. 
1. Sentient food is here. It's all rather communist.
1. There's a moon-roof here, shining pure, white light into the room. When you look up you can see the Smiling Giant crucified to the surface. There are one hundred pigeons here. They are all familiars who have been caged. They burst into flame if released from their cages.
1. Another Moon room, with the light shining down. Things can be released from their cave here and not burn anymore.
1. The King's Archmage dwells in the smelter, forging blades. His magic controls them. He will talk to you. But if you make him mad, he will attack. 
1. Colehandro is a glorious fighter, dazzling with the bow, and a very debonair dresser. He is here searching for his lover, a beautiful human woman who was stolen from him. He is almost stained and hides it well. 
1. A dwarf is here. Curling and spiraling into himself. He's dying. He just wants to go home. Back into the earth.
1. An old lord from a distant land. Stained and fending off a large beast. Rangers from Ran would recognize him as the King of the civilization that existed on the snake before the current one. Several hundred years extinct.
1. Yoshi Cline, knight (samurai) of the Sun King. Long since stained. He calls all who hold pieces of the sun ""Master"" and slowly crawls after them with his black-ink blade.
1. A large snake is trapped here. It is the reason this place was sank and now it hunts the Sun King and the pieces of the sun to free itself and return to its sisters. It will lie to everyone. 
1. Dead adventurers. One has advanced technology with an A.I. that was guiding them. Its been dormant for a hundred years and has gained enlightenment. It gives wisdom in the way of koans.
1. Basilisk
1. A battlefield within a cathedral. Hundreds dead. It looks like a recent battle.
1. War machine sits dormant here. If mixed with an A.I. it will become active.
1. Blacksmith sits hammering away at a perfect sword. Won't give it up unless you can convince him otherwise. He's obviously stained. 
1. A room of red furs. It's a skinned dragon. There's a fire here and the doors lock.
1. A Demon Tree is grown here. The Demon Seed is seen wrapped up by the roots of the tree as its cracked, black bar covers up the glowing, red embers of the inner tree. It lets off lots of heat. Demon Trees keep demons away and hold souls in jars that hang on its branches. 
1. Blue skinned stains lurk here. They float through the air as if weightless. They circle this tall domed room on their backs, singing beautiful music which, if played on an instrument, allows you to float.
1. Room filled with scrolls. All drawings of space and the stars. Tsioh the Mage stays here at times. He's been stained but still holds a lot of humanity. He's just looking for the observatory.
1. There's a dock that goes out onto the seafloor. Pirates dwell here. Sometimes its one of the Pirate Queens.
1. Ibby is a lost boy. He has a pendant of the phoenix. He is the child version of the Sun King. 
1. Revenants hang from nooses here. Each one takes the shape of someone you feel guilty of killing.
1. An artificial intelligence is here, left by that same group of dead adventurers. This one has 3D models of areas local to it. It was trying to map this area but needs help moving.
1. It's a room with a moose. It walks slowly towards you. This sense of dread growing. If it reaches you, it strikes you with a stain. There's treasure in this room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP FOUR
--

The next step will be to do the rest of the rooms. I take these first 50 as a proof of concept. And I like it so far. I think I would have a lot of fun in this place.

Let me know what you think so far. If this is at all helpful. Further steps will be a map, a secondary pass, a stat-pass (where I do stats for all monsters/npcs), a secret pass (where I put all the secrets/collectibles/rewards in), and then layout.

I wrote a book! It's called [Haunted](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258940/Haunted). 

It's Undertale meets D&amp;D, in a strange land where giants where sheets like ghost costumes. A place of undeath and oddities.

# The Hivemaster

The Hivemaster Druid lives to foster insect and arachnid life wherever it exists. Most see themselves as outsiders in the Order, relegated to the mead/cider farms or wax-works run by allies of the Order (or worse - pest control), but they provide a vital guardianship for the most fragile, and necessary, elements of any ecosystem - the insects and arachnids. Without them, life stops. The Hivemaster Druids are zealous, intractable, and prone to speech-making, and while most have a close relationship with an area's population (unlike a lot of the other archetypes), they are not always seen as a wise and stabilizing force. The Hivemaster's role in a community is varied and unique, and as such, they do not travel as much as other Druids, tending to stick to one populated area and dividing their time between all villages, hamlets, towns and cities found within. 

There are 4 known insects that make hives - the bee, the ant, the wasp, and the termite. The way these creatures survive informs all of the virtues that a Hivemaster holds dear - cooperation, diligence, patience, and determination. The Hivemaster sees the Hive as the ultimate expression of Nature working perfectly, and as a result, many model themselves to mimic these qualities. Though they are strongly opinionated on the qualities of these virtues when explaining to a local about why their lives are so chaotic and sorrowful, they are rarely prone to grabbing power for themselves - even though many consider themselves superior to any current ruler who doesn't espouse the same virtues as the Hive. 

Arachnids and other insects, numerous they may be, are respected and preserved whenever possible, but it is the Hive that truly drives the Druid. They will foster hive-life within their territory, insomuch as they fit into the ecosystem, and will ensure that the hives are allowed to live out their natural lifespans, free from outside scavengers (like honey thieves). Insect life is fleeting and sacrificial by its very nature. The roles they play are meant to drive the quick and day-to-day web of life. Insects devour the dead, convert the rotting, and are themselves devoured in turn. A Hivemaster is not sentimental, even more so than the other archetypes, they understand the short nature of life, and can be seen as cold to the communities they serve. In times of disease or other catastrophe, a Hivemaster often has no words of comfort for the bereaved, believing that all have played their role in preserving the Balance. 

However, every Hivemaster celebrates the life that we are given in countless ways. The natural products provided by bees alone are traded and gifted to those who need and want them, and the Druid ensures that the quality of these natural gifts is always of the highest standard. To farm these products, a Hivemaster needs to be skilled in gardening, insect husbandry, woodworking, wax-working, beer and wine making, and even cooking since fruit trees and beehives do so well together. A working hive setup can produce a lot of useful products, and Hivemaster communities tend to attract Chandlers, Brewers and Vintners. This, in turn, creates wealth for the community, but sometimes this can upset the balance of the Hivemaster's goals, and oftentimes they are forced to deny the Hive products to the voracious maw of commerce. This has caused much havoc in the past, and while the Order does not like upheaval, each Druid is free to pursue the Balance however they see fit, in most cases, and the Order does not interfere. 

Some Hivemasters do travel, however, since bees are a vital part of the pollination process, a traveling Hivemaster will visit hamlets (villages with orchards) on a ""tour"" each year, ensuring that the agriculture of an area stays healthy. Some travel with arachnid ""shows"", educating the population on the virtues of their ecological niche. Some act as ""pest control"" and prune populations back to a sustainable level, sometimes eradicating millions of insects in the process. Hivemasters are the only druid archetype who understands that the charges they protect and nurture are often prone to ecological disaster-scenarios, where the population grows exponentially and threatens the whole web of life. They are masters of poisons, traps, baits, and flame. These are their tools as well as ice, acids, and straight force, Hivemaster tend to pack a more potent magical punch when it comes to selecting spells. 

Among the more ""utility-type"" spells, there are some differences with a Hivemaster. For example, Animal Friendship, Speak With Animals, and Summon Animals will effect insects, giant insects, or arachnids only. Hivemasters roll with Disadvantage when using animal skills on non insects/arachnids.

When using wildshape, a Hivemaster can assume a giant bee, a giant spider, or a giant ant instead of the other choices (bird, mammal, reptile).

The other spells favored by Hivemasters are Sleep, Giant Insect and Insect Swarm, and these last two function as if the Druid were 2 levels higher. Fog Cloud can be modified by a Hivemaster to become a wood-smoke cloud, but only if working to control insects. Smoke affects bees by tricking them into thinking a fire is nearby, forcing them to gorge on honey and then become docile because they overate, and smoke interrupts/blocks the Alarm pheremone common to the species. This allows a Hivemaster to move and interact with them without being swarmed and stung.

Hivemasters gain a Resistance to insect/arachnid poisons and can pass through Web spells as if they were not there. 

# NPC Examples

* **Toddle Angre**: This Human Hivemaster lives and works near a bustling hamlet near a trade road. His honey and wax products are quite popular, and this has increased the demand for them. He has doubled the number of working hives and has taken on 3 apprentices, but this is still not enough. Discouraged, he is considering packing up and moving somewhere else, but he is loathe to leave his insects behind. His dedication to the Order is absolute, but his zealotry for beekeeping is causing him stress from the dichotomy. 

* **Zorba Rune**: This Elven Hivemaster had her hives and webs destroyed by marauders, and now she is on the verge of becoming an Avenger Druid. She hunts and lives as the bees and spiders do - with ferociousness and relentless aggression. Her anger has caused her to tip the Balance out of whack in a number of places, and the Order has had to clean up her messes (if you call burning a village of 300 to the ground a ""mess"") and all Druids have been given the task of reporting to the Order if she is spotted. Her one saving trait is that she cannot bring herself to sacrifice her insects and arachnids in battle (making Giant ones are a favorite pastime), and so she is waging this war alone and it is starting to take its toll on her.


* **Hickander Maplebranch**: This Gnomish Hivemaster is a traveler - going from village to hamlet to town to village, he gives educational classes to the youth and curious about bees and termites with several mockups and practical demonstrations (including some magical spells for effect and examples). He gives all his wealth away, confident that Nature's gifts will provide. A trusting and open sort, he believes the Order should use its power to tip the scales of Balance towards a more harmonious existence with humanoids, and away from the stern and unforgiving ""justice"" that the Order metes out. 


# Plot Hooks

* The party receives a letter from an old Druid ally who has joined the Order as a Hivemaster. The Druid begs for aid, as their beekeeping farm has become corrupted and Giant Bees and Wasps are now running amok, killing livestock and the local populace. A corrupted Druid, and enemy to the party's ally, is behind the events.
* The party finds themselves in a deep wood, among huge spiderwebs. The party gets ambushed by Giant Spiders, but before the encounter ends, a Hivemaster shows up, angry and threatening the party for killing his ""pets"". The Druid calls for Giant Insect reinforcements and bullies the party into leaving the wood. If left unchecked, this Hivemaster's arachnids will eventually populate the entire forest. 
* While visiting a village, the party is offered honey at the Tavern, and told its local. If the party eats some, they become sickened and begin to suffer strange transformations - bee wings, antennae, and eventually a stinger. If the party does not eat the honey, they see the villagers undergo the same transformations. Told that a local Hivemaster has gone missing, the party will find the Druid, dead, and the trappings of a ritual that appears to have killed the Druid. Revenge or a curse, the party does not know, but time is running out before the transformations are permanent.
* A series of Giant Termite mounds begin appearing in local farmland, and the villagers are in a panic as the insects have begun devouring houses and local businesses. All attempts to drive the termites off have failed, and when the party arrives, the villagers are holed up in the local Mill - the only stone building in town. The villagers explain that their local Druid was driven off, accussed of a crime it was later discovered they didn't commit. If the party searches, the Druid has taken up residence in a nearby wood, but refuses to help the villagers who betrayed him. He offers no advice and no explanation as to the termite phenomenon, but knows that it is the result of a Hag's curse.
* The party is contacted by a local Hivemaster who asks for aid in destroying a series of Giant Wasps nests in the area. The wasps have been killing locals and are breeding in numbers. The creatures have been naturally warped by a font of raw dweomer deep underground, its ""vapors"" seeping to the surface and causing strange mutations (and not just among the wasps). 
* An angry Hivemaster has decided to punish a local Elven village for defying their orders to slow their breeding down. The Druid has been casting Insect Swarm every day and harassing the colony. The Elves are at their wit's end and beg the party for aid. If the party confronts the Druid, the Hivemaster will show incontrovertible proof that the Elven presence is going to disrupt the local ecology, sending ripples throughout the web of life that will eventually result in this entire area becoming a wasteland.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,124,"With the start of a new year nearly upon us, many people, myself included, are thinking of starting brand new campaigns. Fresh starts are great for getting people excited about the game again and are important to allow you to explore areas you otherwise wouldn't be able to if you played the same game for years on end. Starting a new campaign can be difficult, however. Managing schedules, coordinating characters, planning overarching plots, building a world, and encouraging teamwork all before the end of the first session can be overwhelming. Today, I'd like to break down what goes into starting a new campaign, and what can be done to simplify the process. 

#Session 0

One of the most important things I like to do when I start a new campaign is to hold a session 0. For those of you haven't heard of session 0, it is a session with its sole purpose to have everyone on the same page. You discuss the rules, create characters together, establish boundaries, and discover what everyone wants from the campaign. Session 0's are very important but are very often misunderstood because people don't know what to expect from them. Because session 0's are so different from normal sessions, many people tend to overthink them. Session 0's are actually fairly simple, it's just a time for you and your players to establish what you want out of the game.

This [Session 0 Checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/601awb/session0_topic_checklist_and_guide/) made by /u/HazeZero provides a massive wealth of questions that you can ask your players the first time you guys sit down together. Just go through it piece by piece and be sure to ask your players the questions you find to be most relevant. Doing this will give you a great understanding of what everybody wants, and might even spark important discussions that everyone should be aware of. 

#Inbetween 0 and 1

I do very little planning before the Session 0. At most I will have a world prepared and a general idea of what I want from the game. ([Sometimes, I won't even have a world prepared](https://onlyontuesdays27.com/2018/05/15/using-microscope-for-dnd/)). But after I receive everyone's input, we have a world prepared, and characters have been made, I start to prepare. One of the first things I start with is creating a [Map with 3 Hooks](https://onlyontuesdays27.com/2017/06/13/starting-a-game-the-map-with-3-hooks/). To put it simply, I make a map of the surrounding area, about 1-5 miles across, and add 3 or more hooks to it for the players to explore. Doing this gives the players the freedom to explore while keeping the workload reasonable on my part.

The next thing I would recommend is to create the endgame villain. In the Session 0, you should have learned how long the players would like the campaign to be. With this in mind, you can then create a villain who the players will eventually have to face off with. With this in mind, you can also tune your 3 hooks to also tie into this final villain. Thanks to the information you have received in the Session 0, you can also create [a villain who is tied with the players and is a foil to the party](https://onlyontuesdays27.com/2018/12/04/creating-a-compelling-villain/). This villain can then be the driving force behind the campaign, and the ultimate goal for your players.

#Session 1

Once you get to this part, everything should be set in place. Everyone knows what to expect, you have a great villain waiting in the wings, you have a mini sandbox for them to explore with several hooks to choose from. With all of that being said, the goal of this session is to get the players invested with their characters and with each other. Dnd is a game all about teamwork, and establishing that early on in the campaign will lead to great sessions down the line. 

There are 2 ways to establish great teamwork in the beginning. The first can be through a puzzle that requires all of the characters unique skills to accomplish. What if there is a door that requires the rogue to unlock it, but it is floating in the air? Then you need the wizard to cast levitate to allow the rogue to unlock it. But then, goblins start swarming in and the fighter has to protect the wizard. The other way you can establish teamwork is through insurmountable odds. When everything is at it's most dire, the party will do everything they can to get out, which in turn will lead to teamwork. Whether the task is insurmountable or not isn't really that important, but the appearance of unbeatable odds will drive your players to work as a team. 

#Conclusion

Starting a campaign is not necessarily an easy task. But if done correctly, a good start will lead to months and years of fun. There are a lot of things to cover at the beginning, and breaking it up into smaller tasks is one of the best ways to go about it. Session 0's are great for establishing the tone for the game and can give you all of the information you need to prepare for the actual game itself. And once you finally get there, if you can get the party to work as a cohesive unit, the rest of the campaign will be a breeze. Thank you all for reading, I hope you have a great week and an amazing Tuesday!

Dwarves tend to always be the same, so I came up with a few different takes on their cultures. I tried to make them still feel dwarf-y, they’re different but always start from the same core ideas of lawfulness, stoneworking, wealth and worship of the ancestors. 

This is the first: A dwarven culture in a tropical climate, inspired by a mixture of Brazilian aesthetics and prosperity theology in a heavily classist society, based around internal struggles more than fighting with greenskins or other toothy beasts. 

Names and languages are a (mostly random) mix of dwarven and Portuguese

*Soon as we were out of the jungle we found ourselves on an open hill, right above the city. First thing we saw was a massive, sprawling shanty town of small but colourful flat-roofed houses that extended around a group of enormous monoliths that had been dug in and transformed into fortresses and residences for the rich. Caught between the sea and the wild jungle, Carakadera, capital of the Kingdom of Comarca Antiga, is unlike any dwarf city I know.* – Jerry Spipparat, Half-Elf explorer.”

---
---
**General Culture: Firm, immobile and unchangeable, like a mountain**

“Everything is how it should be, as the ancestors will.” That is the core of Comarcian culture. Rich people are rich because the ancestors decided they deserved it. Poor people are poor because they’re being punished. Their society revolves around a sense of immutability, stone-like permanence. 

 You should expect to do the same job your parents did, remain in the same class, live in the same place. Change goes against the will of the ancients. Similarly to Calvinist predestination, people are encouraged to accept what they have and never try to improve things. Only in extremely exceptional cases someone can move up or down the social ladder.

For the people in power, this is a very convenient situation: their power and wealth are guaranteed no matter what, and it’s not clear how many of them really believe this and how many just use it as an excuse to hold on to power.

For the poor, this often results in a very defeatist approach to life: if a war or a plague breaks out, that’s just how it is. Accept it and do as you’re told. 

This doesn’t mean people are stupid, if they are robbed or attacked, they’ll defend themselves, but if they are involved in complex machinations or other things much bigger than they are, they may just go with the flow and not try to change things. If an adventure seems impossible, they may just give up. 

Comarcian dwarves tend to think small, the large world can’t be changed or saved, no point trying. Just think about your family or spouse or friends and try to save them for what you can.

Rich dwarves live in isolation in their mountains, looking at the poor down in the shanties with contempt. If they deserved it, they think, they would be rich as well. 
As a result, their society is extremely stagnant, bad at adapting to sudden changes and vulnerable to other societies that move much faster.

There is always a great difference between the theory of a religion and its practical application, so this shouldn’t be an iron rule but a general idea, often applied inconsistently, like all philosophies are. 

If something is big enough to warrant a change, like a noble committing a crime too terrible to be hidden, it's a big deal.

All jobs related to working with metals, stone and gems are considered sacred, forbidden to those unworthy. The nobles are the only ones that can make full use of them, while poor dwarfs may be allowed to dabble in them a tiny bit if their families are particularly wealthy or respected. 

A nobledwarf could have a talented blacksmith making iron or mithril objects for them, while a powerful lower-class family could have some copper or bronze items made in a small forge. 


Most of the population lives in a few sprawling cities, **Carakadera** being the capital. There are also mining towns, forts and plantations in the jungle.  

**Note** – I use rich and poor as short-hand, but it’s really about “upper class” and “lower class”, a lower class could amass a decent sum of money and still be considered unworthy, and a noble family can keep its power even if they lose all they have. Still, most of the wealth is concentrated in the upper caste.

--- 
**Biology and aspect**

Comarcian dwarves are generally the same are regular ones, physically. Their skins a bit darker, red or blonde hair are extremely rare, but the changes end there.
Upper-class dwarves act and dress like regular ones: they copy their ancestors, wearing decorative armours, styling their beards, using mithril and doing everything else a dwarf is expected to do. 

This isn’t done out of real tradition, but of a need to appear traditional. As a result, they often misunderstand or not really know what they are doing and end up looking almost like caricatures of a dwarf. To look “more dwarvish” and “more appropriate” they will embrace all stereotypes. What looks ridiculous to a regular dwarf is an honour for them. 

Because of the hot climate, they have a lot of problems with heat. They spend most of their time in their underground citadels, cold and tranquil. When they have to go out, something they rarely want to, it’s a hard challenge finding a balance between looking proper and not having a heat stroke.
This is often a superficial knowledge of ancient traditions and has developed its own quirks over the centuries.

Lower class dwarfs are in the opposite situation: they aren’t allowed to be traditional.

To wear the ancient armours, rings and furs, you have to deserve it. You’re being like the ancients, a great honour that isn’t given to the normal people.

Lower class dwarves wear ample, colourful robes and belts, capes or pareos. Each family saws their own, and they are decorated with both geometrical and natural themes. While simpler than the mithril full plates of the nobles, they are still very artistical objects and can hold deep meanings.  Usually they’re made of grass or leaves dried and interlaced, such as Sennit, feathers, dried bark and sometimes cotton.

Their beards are simpler, more large than long, but can be decorated with seeds, bones, bark or any other material that isn’t traditionally associated with dwarfness.

---
**Life in the slums**

The life of the average Comarcian dwarf is mostly work. The majority works in mines or plantations around the cities, or are fisherdwarfs. Those that live in the city run all sorts of stores and services, from cobblers to bakeries, tanneries, money lenders, doctors, herborists, millers and butchers.

There is no middle class, a merchant is the same as a soldier, a peasant or a miner. The lower class is left to their own device, creating almost a parallel society to that of the nobles, that have their own doctors, butchers, herborists etc.

The difference between the two is that those working for the nobles follow, as well as they can, the ancient traditions. Their food is similar to that you’ll find in a regular dwarf house, their dresses are fashioned in similar ways etc.

The lower classes, while still respecting their ancestors, have evolved into a very different culture, but still follow the basic tenants of dwarfdom: family, honour and hard work.

Families are very large, often with multiple generations living together or very close to each other, similar to traditional catholic European families. 

The slums are also filled with crime and corruption. Nobles don’t really care about them, and they’re considered unworthy, so crime is almost expected. This creates a ripe environment for criminal lords that, unable to gain power legally, do it on their own. 

Criminal lords fight over the city, offering protection to stores, trafficking, murder, drugs, everything you would expect. Like the mafia or cartels in many South-American countries, these criminals try to befriend the civilians where possible, creating a sense of a large family, of working for the community. 

When it doesn’t work, kidnappings, beatings and murders come into play. Carrot and stick.
Some criminals are more violent than others, and some really believe they are part of a family, in a twisted idea of dwarven honour.

---
**Art and food** 

Common dwarves eat mostly fruit, vegetables and fish. Their possibilities are limited and their diet simple, but nutritious.

 Over the centuries, they have developed a quite large array of recipes and their food is far from bad. The land is fertile, and people eat well, with easy access to both sugar and proteins.


All sorts of tropical plants can be found: papaya, pineapples, bananas, cocoa and coffee. 

They don’t have access to traditional ales or beer, so their alcohol comes in the form of fruit wine,  rum, tequila, curaçao, and various cocktails.  


Music, painting and wood carving are all popular forms of art: as long as they don’t involve metals, gems or stone, everything is allowed. Many houses are painted with colours of the various families, scenes of great feats and battles done by their ancestors and family trees. 


Music is common, from flutes to drums, harps, various types of percussions, a large variety of instruments is used in the many religious and popular festivals. 
Wood-carving is also popular, as most houses and tools are made of wood. Despite their differences, they’re still dwarfs, with crafty hands and a passion for details and making everything they do as well as possible, with fine decorations and complex patterns. 

---
**Life in the mountains** 

The life of upper-class dwarfs is strange. Attempting to imitate the old way, often without really understanding them, they end up being more similar to a dwarf stereotype,  than to a real dwarf. Large armours, hammers and axes, beer and jewellery, everything you’d imagine to find is there.

But it’s all overplayed and excessive, often looking ridiculous or offensive to common dwarves that happen to visit.

These dwarves put a lot of emphasis on procedures and traditions, tirelessly delving into ancient tomes and carvings searching for the ancestor's ways and habits, or for blood connections to some old figure of legend. 

The powerful families are very large, and divided into various branches. Usually, there are only one or two main branches that take decisions, with multiple minor ones supplying soldiers, workers, bureaucrats and everything else necessary to those higher in the hierarchy. 

It is possible for a branch to rise or fall in power, usually through marriage or the loss of an important member, and vast webs of intrigue and conspiracy have been created over the centuries.  

**Reunions**

The noble families are extremely static, but sometimes they need new members, for whatever reason.

This happens through the process of Reunion: A noble family can pick someone from the lower class and declare they have a blood tie to them. That dwarf, while born in the slums, was supposed to be a member of the upper class. They will go live with their new family, either as part of them or creating their own minor branch, and abandon their old identity. They always were upper class, chosen by the ancestors, simply… misplaced, or misunderstood. They’re finally reunited with their true family. 

Some people really believe this, others think it’s just a convenient lie for the nobles to skirt around their own laws without breaking tradition. In any case, it’s rare enough to rarely cause a commotion, but when it happens its ramifications can be vast. 

A poorly thought out Reunion can damage the reputation of a noble family, and even cause them to fall out of grace and be cast out, into the slums, abandoned by the ancients.

These “exiled” nobles are very rare, but they do happen and are considered pariah even among lower classes, usually ending up as criminals or in complete poverty.
The nobles have their own economy, caring about the slums only when it’s about taxes, commerce or reputation. 

---
**Politics**

There is a king, but his power is relatively limited. The noble families have veto power, and they get to pick the new king when one dies, in a system similar to Electors in the Holy Roman Empire. 

Usually, the king is already decided long before it’s needed, based on bloodlines and pedigree. Having the king be a member of your family is a great honour, and many dwarves would do anything to get one of their parents on the throne. 

---
**Religion**

Comarcian dwarves are less concerned with Muradin&amp;co. than others, giving them only the minimum respect necessary, and tend to worship their own ancestors. This means there isn’t a true, unified church but instead, each family has its own cult, with shrines and temples dedicated only to their forefathers, and their own priests. 

Clerics are the only real connection between lower and upper class: many religious festivities involve commoners, so many priests are involved with both worlds, often taking members of the lower class as deacons. 
 
---
**Crime**


Criminals, mostly living in the slums, are generally of two types: some believe they should be part of the nobility and act their ways, following the ancient traditions. This is considered blasphemous by the nobles and they will do everything they can to stop it.

Other criminals don’t care, and either just wants money and power, living like a wealthy person of the slums, or actively make a mockery of tradition, parodying and disparaging the nobles traditions.

Crime happens between the upper class as well, even if most of the time it’s kept a secret from the public. Corruption is the most common, often to hide when a tradition has been broken, usually a crime in itself.

Murders, blackmail and kidnapping aren’t rare, but less common than in other races nobilities. Dwarves are hard to kill, and not particularly good at sneaking around. Not to mention, their security tends to be top notch. Excellent locks, trained guards etc.

---
**Other races**

For the lower class, relations with other races are common: lizardpeople and yuan-ti live in the jungle and end up either fighting or (rarely) trading with the dwarves. Underground, all the classic races can be found: drows, druegars and various monsters. 

In the sea, shaugaugin and tritons live. They have a somewhat pacific relation with the dwarves, who have little interest in conquering the sea outside of farming near the coast. In dwarven cities built on the coast, often can be found houses built partially or entirely underwater where members of those races live.

The upper class doesn't like or care about anything that isn’t a dwarf, with maybe the exception of metallic dragons, but their relations to other races often come down to convenience.

Comarcian dwarves don’t have a lot of connection with elves, humans and other traditional races. What they know mostly comes from stereotypes, and since they really do love their stereotypes, it may be hard for those races to deal with them. This is especially true for nobles. Having one in your party may be extremely annoying for any elf around, since the dwarf not only dislikes them for no good reason but actively believes he should dislike them. Disliking elves is a good thing in itself, to not dislike them distasteful.

Even if the elf showed themselves reliable, intelligent, pleasant or anything else, the noble dwarf may still treat them like shit. They aren’t grumbly but honourable, just assholes.

Obviously, there are always exceptions, but their society doesn’t tolerate them very much.

---
**War**

Wars aren’t very common here. Riots and guerrilla are the norms. When large conflicts arise they are against the lizardpeople, the snakes, or invading forces from other continents. 

They have a small stable army, but all those able are expected to be ready to fight at all times if the nobles call. It rarely works well, their armies being disorganized and led by people that lowkey hate their own soldiers.

Professional soldiers are the elite force of the kingdom, being part of the noble families, they are equipped with the finest armours and weapons a dwarf can have. They oversee the city guard, made of conscripts from the lower caste. Their gear is poor and simple, but they do have metal weapons and tools regular dwarves can’t have.

The city guard is deeply corrupt, oppressive and violent. The soldiers tend to keep to themselves and only act against the biggest criminal groups, stop riots or protect the nobles.

---
**Statistics** 

**Note** – These numbers are **NOT** well balanced, I mostly did whatever felt flavorful, if you want to actually use these guys I encourage you to come up with whatever best fits your campaign and playstyle. 

Genetically similar to traditional dwarves, Comarcian dwarves have different traits due to their different traditions

**Ability score**: +2 constitution, +1 wisdom or +1 intelligence for upper-class dwarves, who spend more time studying and researching than working, and +2 strength or +2 dexterity for lower class dwarves that are used to working all day.


**Language** – Dwarven, but the Comarcian dialect has many differences, a regular dwarf would understand roughly half of it and vice-versa.  Upper-class dwarves know both regular dwarfian and the Comarcian dialect, lower class people know only the dialect.

**Lower class** 

**dwarven combat training**, replaced with **Comarcian combat training**: proficiency with handaxe, blowpipe, lance, net and shortsword. 

**Tool proficiency**  gain proficiency for the appropriate tools in one of your choice between: working wood, working bone.

**Local knowledge**: gain advantage in all checks related to identifying natural creatures from your homeland, such as tracks, poisons, types of plants, finding food etc. 

 **Natural Insight**: because of their reliance on plants, these dwarves have advantage on all checks related to finding food in a natural environment or growing vegetables.

**Upper class**

Same as a regular dwarf, I guess. 


---
**Characters from Comarca Antiga**

There are many reasons why a comarcian dwarf could go on an adventure

**Lower class**: If at home, they could be hired as a guide by a group of foreigner to travel through the jungle, and take a liking lifestyle, or be involved with some criminal or noble conspiracy in the slums, and once done they’d be considered too “exposed” to go back to their regular lives, having broken too many traditions. 

Comarcian dwarves that travel often do so because they dislike life at home: they don’t believe in their rigid society, maybe they want more than they’d be allowed to have or just want freedom. Maybe they already attempted to go against tradition and have been forced to flee in shame. Maybe their own family hates them for it, or maybe they secretly support them. 

They could also be explorers looking to visit the land of other dwarves to find something belonging to an ancestor, to improve the reputation of their family.

**Upper class:** at home, will seldom go on an adventure. Young ones may do it to try and prove themselves, or because their family needs something done and they’ve been chosen to keep an eye on the mercenaries they’ve hired. Maybe their family is involved in some illegal scheme, and they’re acting against the law. 

If they leave home, it’s usually to find something of great importance that belonged to an ancestor, or proof of a blood connection with some great dwarf. Recovering lost artefacts or settling an old grudge. 
Or maybe they’ve been forced to leave the country after having their reputation ruined, maybe they did something, or they have been framed by a rival family or family member.

**Ploot hooks for travelling to Comarca Antiga**

The main reason to go here is commerce, the country has many rare plants, animals and works of art. The yuan-ti that live in the nearby jungles could also be involved in some larger plot that attracts adventurers from other countries.  Diplomatic missions are also an option.

If one of the adventurers is a dwarf, he may distant family in Carakadera that called them for some reason.

- King Julius III has been attacked, the heroes saved him at the last moment. The assassin… A yuan-ti! Why is he so far from his home? Why do they want to kill the king? An old prophecy sends the heroes on an investigation that ends in a hidden temple at the bottom of a lake in the jungle of Comarca

- The ship the players were on has shipwrecked, as always, and they’re now stranded on a small island not far off the coast of Carakadera. The waters are treacherous, and there are no cities in sight.

- The players followed a cultist through a portal and now are in a ziggurat in an unkwon jungle. On a nearby mountain, a mine is visible, and other ziggurats pop their heads from the trees. 

- The dwarf player received a strange letter from his uncle Xavièr, they haven’t seen each other for years. He was very rich and talks about a great danger, 250 barrels of coca leaves and some guy called Escobàrok escudo-de-Carvalho.
- The crypt of a dwarf king has been robbed, and objects that were in the tomb seem to have appeared in the Y black market.

---
**Plot hooks for Adventures**

Once there, the players will either leave for the jungles, where they’ll fight poachers and wild animals, lizardmen and snèkmen and maybe find some isolated village, mine or plantation in the jungle. Ancient ruins to explore can be found. If they remain in town, they may be involved in political games or the machinations of a crime lord.


-  An important diplomat from another country went missing, the players are asked to look for him in an unofficial capacity. It seems some important priest is involved, and the thing needs to be kept a secret from everybody, foreigners and local nobles alike.

- An ancient chapel is infested by angry ghosts, bringing great shame to the family that owns it. But when the players are hired to solve the problem, they find out something much worse happened many generations ago.

- Brueño Machado is in big trouble: years ago he found a plant called Mango in a distant land and spent a lot of time and money trying to get it approved for cultivation in Carakadera. But recently, a rival appeared with a tome that talks of an ancient dwarven king disliking the fruit and banning it. If true, Brueño will be ruined. He asks the players to steal or destroy that book, or find a way around it.

- Many houses in the slum have burned down recently, it seems to be an arsonist. A singular madman? The work of a gang? A cult? Or something else entirely?

- When the Broken Knife gang kidnaps the son of a very important family, all hell breaks loose. Soldiers comb the city day and night, beating anyone that seems suspicious and many that don’t. Innocents are arrested. Guards turn out dead. A huge reward pushes people to distrust each other, creating conflicts and chaos. The players attempt to find the kidnapped dwarf, but once they start investigating, they find much more than they had bargained for.  A traitor noble, an old curse and a red dragon are tied in a thousand-years-old catastrophe, and the burning city is the background of their tragedy.

**Contrabandista (Smuggler)**

While a regular criminal can use the Criminal or Urchin background, some dwarves are more specialized and work in bringing illegal things between the jungle and the city, the city and the merchants, or around the city itself. 

Ranging from drugs to metals, from illegal animals to ancient objects stolen from a noble to a simple iron shovel your dad really likes to use, hiding objects you’re not supposed to have is a very important talent in Comarca.

---
**Comarcian Sage**

Your life has been spent delving into ancient tomes, carvings and legends, trying to find something to improve your family reputation or damage that of your rivals. You’ve scoured thousands of tales of dinners, marriages and funerals. You’ve learned every detail of Ingrim Ironthunder garden to make sure your family cultivates the same flowers and you’ve jumped with joy (after making sure nobody was watching) once you discovered the legendary Angarad Orcsmasher was bald with a red beard, just like your noble grandfather, and not black-haired as it was previously believed.  

**Skills: History**(INT), **Persuasion**(CHA)

**Personality – Lower class** (d8)

**1**-     Work is a part of life, I never say no to a request, no matter how hard it is, and people lazying around surprises me

**2**-	Life is all about family, listen to your parents and do as you’re told. Why would anyone argue against their father, when he obviously must know best?

**3**-	I’m used to noise and confusion, living in a cramped city. I feel uneasy in the wilderness, not only it’s dangerous but I feel as if I was doing something improper. The noise of the crowd calms me.

**4**-	We’re all cogs in the machine, crushed under the wheels of greed and oppression. Just do as you’re told and try to survive, no point in trying to break free of the system. It’s an unavoidable situation.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,2,57,"Two weeks ago, I wrote a post detailing my concept for using Druidic Groves as a source of power for nature magic, and more specifically, [the dangers they might pose upon transplantation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a5u3g0/the_druid_as_an_invasive_species/). Though I don’t think I typed it aloud, this lead to the implication that the druid and Grove form a symbiotic relationship together in which the druid tends the Grove, and in return is empowered to protect and serve. (Side note: This isn’t unlike the relationship between cleric and deity, or warlock and patron, though maybe less manipulative. Pact of the Vine, anyone?) But what I left out was the role of the ranger in all of this (and, for a later follow-up, the barbarian.)

**The Ranger as an Apex Predator**

The ranger is built to combat a specific type of foe, and to do so well. They stalk their prefered terrain without a trace, focusing their senses to detect their prey within *miles*, and augment these natural talents with a limited spellcasting ability granted by the local Grove, like that of a paladin. But unlike a paladin, the ranger has no strict code to adhere to. She simply has a job; to limit the collisions between civilization and the wilds beyond, and when his foes grow numerous, to cull the herd. And while some rangers may organize themselves, or work together with local druids, the ranger may not even be explicitly aware of this role. But so long as she is fulfilling this duty and remains in touch with the land, the Grove may lend her some of its power. In this way, the ranger, already an Apex Predator in its own right, claims an established role as the militant arm of the ecosystem.

**You Say “Gone Astray,” I Say “Trailblazing”**

Rangers are, by nature, goal-oriented and individualistic, driven to pursue their quarry by whatever means necessary. While honor isn’t necessarily something they are unfamiliar with, it certainly takes a backseat when you’ve spent your life fighting as a hunter, striking from ambush and engaging in skirmishes when your prey is unprepared. Because of this, they may be more willing to employ unconventional tactics on the battlefield, and ignore local treaties or political boundaries in pursuit of their goal. Often this will be overlooked by local governments, provided the end result is a safer territory, but when a ranger’s hunt puts him at odds with a group equipped to police such action, this may in turn endanger the very land his work had been protecting. In such a case, warnings come to the ranger on the wind, or are sung by the birds, or most directly, are delivered by the druids whose home he has endangered. In the most extreme circumstances, failure to heed these warnings could result in revocation, leaving the ranger stripped of his magic and left to fend for himself.

So what is a ranger to do when faced with such a threat? Letting the quarry go unchecked is out of the question, and frankly, the access to magic she’s enjoyed thus far has made things go far too smoothly to give that up. So what is the recourse of an intelligent predator when the enemy has taken shelter in a herd? They form a pack.

**The Leader of the Pack**

Rangers who share a territory almost undoubtedly know of one another. Perhaps they’ve never met face to face, but the signs (or lack thereof) are plain for those who know where to look, and it is common courtesy to discreetly share information via dead drops marked by [moss sign](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Moss-Graffiti) written either in Sylvan or some form of cant or cryptoform in the style of hobo signs. 

When pressed, the rangers may put out a call, actively recruiting to form a paramilitary sect to “manage” the problem. With the core pack formed, they have one objective - locate and isolate the target. If this is a military target, like an orcish outpost, for example, they would look to make the location inhospitable without drawing attention (and reinforcements). This means utilizing stealth to sabotage methods of transportation; disrupting communications by waylaying messengers or employing falcons to intercept carrier birds; fouling water sources, etc. An individual target may be drawn out with “accidental” fires, or a distraction employed to facilitate an infiltration under cover of *fog cloud*. In any case, the eventual strike is coordinated, quiet, and decisive. And when it’s all over, the pack slinks back into the wilderness and either disbands into its constituent parts, or if their long-term goals align, they may form a permanent Order, and share the burden of patrolling the region.",1,The Ranger - Apex Predator Elect

# The Grey Druid

The rare Grey Druids inhabit and tend the shadowy realms of the hidden life that exists without sunlight - fungi, molds, and slimes - and the nocturnal creatures that dwell in lightless, subterranean realms. Grey Druids are more closely associated with the earth than with other elements of Nature. While many of them live in underground caves or ruins (especially in the Underdark), they are found any place fungal life grows abundantly, either above or below ground. 

Life underground is fraught with peril, filled with monsters as it is, and so the Grey Druid is a tenacious survivor, only the strongest and most cunning of the Order will dare to take up the mantle. Understanding ecologies and terrain comprises the bulk of the Grey Druid's knowledge, although they are master alchemists and by degrees more dangerous than any Rogue when it comes to stealth and surprise.

Achieving Balance in such a place is the most difficult task facing any Grey Druid. Life that arises from natural processes is to be protected, but creatures that are formed from the hubris of mages and necromancers, or those called by arcane fonts, or created by some other supernatural method are to be violently opposed and destroyed. Maintaining these fragile ecosystems is profoundly difficult. 

Grey Druids tend to oppose adventurers, especially Dwarves, who they believe defile and exploit the underground environment. They have very good relations with the Svirfneblin (Deep Gnomes) and passable relations with Drow, who they feel show more appreciation of the beauty of the Underdark than most Dwarves or Humans. Derro and Duegar are rarely trusted, as are any of the other intelligent, but aggressive, races like Ogres, Trolls, Hags, Illithid, and the like. If a Grey Druid discovers an Aboleth's lair, it will lay down all other tasks and devote the rest of its life to destroying it - being an Outsider, it has no place in the natural web of life. 

Grey Druids hang around popular caverns, attempting to prevent deaths of outsiders as well as members of the underground ecology they are tasked to protect. Warnings are usually second-hand, but the Grey Druid will go full guerrilla-mode if a determined group ignores the obvious threat. Often, though, one Druid is not enough for a well-equipped, and powerful party, so they must call upon their allies - carefully cultivated through Diplomacy and common ground. 

Grey Druids can be found with all manner of ooze, slime, and pudding companions. They befriend Stirge and Grell alike, and have developed a pidgin between the Order and the Otyughs (and Neo-Otyugh, if present). Grey Druids always make peace with Galeb Duhr and any peaceful elemental creatures, if possible, and some have developed understandings with Hook Horrors and Umber Hulks. Never underestimate the creativity of a Grey Druid - their resources are vast and unending, a necessity if the Order is to survive in such a hostile place.

Grey Druids will know the area they protect and any surrounding areas, up to 5 miles distant. Cavern systems are often extremely confusing, with twists, turns, and rapid changes in the elevation and size of tunnels. All Grey Druids cannot become lost in their home territory, and can roll with Advantage anywhere outside their territory, as long as it is underground. 

Most Demi-Humans, having Dark/Low-Light/Infra Vision types, become Grey Druids, and their long lives allow them to enact long-term plans and strategies for managing their territory. The rare Humans that venture into the Under are the pinnacle of survivor-types - hard, hardy, and cunning, they are the first to kill and ask questions later. Negotiating with a Human Grey Druid is akin to trying to kiss a viper - unpredictable and stupid. 

Grey Druids will choose to remain hidden as long as possible when trying to warn off explorers, or when tracking trespassers, but are not above negotiating if it means the intruders exit the area as quickly as possible. This sometimes takes the form of actual talk (and an escort by the Druid through their territory), and sometimes takes the form of ""gifts"", left by the Druid in the path of the explorers. These gifts range from food and water, to crudely-drawn-but-accurate maps, to light sources, to warnings about what lay ahead. The goal of the Grey Druid is to facilitate the quick and peaceful transition through the area, without any of its creatures being harmed, and without the intruders being harmed either. After all, if a Carrion Crawler gets a taste of Elven flesh when it usually dines on Stirge, then who knows when it might decide to turn on the Druid when food is scarce. Safer to keep ""exotic foods"" out of the ecosystem. 

Grey Druids rarely interact with one another, and even less often with their surface brethren, but it has been known to happen from time-to-time, and the Order's rune-language has the same meanings, regardless of where they are scrawled. This sometimes leads Druids to meet, and when they do, there is usually a sharing of information and a communion of food and drink. It is a sacred thing, to find another who feels the same passion, and while the celebration is usually short, it is not without genuine joy. Too wedded to their duties, the Druids rarely spend more than 1 day together before departing, with promises of assistance in the future if great need arises. Of course, sometimes these meetings are disastrous, personality clashes among people who dwell underground can become...creative, and while open war has never been admitted to exist by the Order, long-running ""border skirmishes"" have been known to occur, especially if the Grey Druid's protected ecosystems meet. Too stubborn to realize that they should be working together to preserve the whole, these clashes destroy the Druids more often than not, leaving their charges unprotected. A greater sin can not be found among the Order. 

# NPC Examples

* **Tasha Bardock**: This Human is new to the Order, and has taken it upon herself to steward a thriving cavern ecosystem, fragile in its volatility, and has become fiercely protective. She will attempt to warn off adventurers/explorers, and if that fails, she will begin to sabotage them - destroying food stuffs, wrecking equipment, and even using magic to seal off tunnels and chambers to force the adventurers to turn back. If her efforts are opposed, and the adventurers kill a lot of the denizens, Tasha will become distraught, and there is a 50% chance that she becomes an Avenger Druid. 

* **Grinkle Grunk**: This Gnomish Druid has not made contact with the surface world in over a decade. He has formed a symbiosis with the large ooze, slime, and intelligent plant population found in this part of the underground world. This friendship extends to mutual protection and anyone who opposes the Druid will quickly find themselves under attack by all manner of alien and weird creatures. Grinkle has planted Shreikers on the edges of his territory and periodically infects dead creatures with spores. Any adventurers who enter the Druid's territory will be swiftly escorted through and out the other side. The Druid will do his best to answer questions and provide aid if needed to anyone wounded, but will not abide aggression towards his ""friends"".

* **Java Silvercliff**: This Dwarven Druid is a consummate wanderer, always moving and meeting new creatures and new situations, for Java, life and the Order are about constant change. The Druid worries less about Balance of a single situation and more about ensuring that ecosystems have parity with one another. This aids diversity and strengthens the environment as a whole. Quick with a joke and a drink, the Druid is happy to aid adventurers and oppose those who want to exploit the gifts of the underground for their own personal gain. He has a deep and abiding fear of Drow, Derro and Illithid, and will go out of his way to avoid them, and warn others of their presence. He does not fight them, he flees. 

# Plot Hooks

* After the party awakens from a night of camping in a cave system, they see fresh graffiti scrawled on a nearby wall - ""LEAVE THIS PLACE"". If they do not, they become subject to a relentless series of guerrilla attacks and sabotage on themselves and their equipment. If the party kills any denizens, the Druid will confront the party directly. The Druid has local allies and is a few levels above the party. 
* A Grey Druid staggers into a town, half-dead, and begs for aid. The Druid explains that the entire empire of the Porto (a Myconid group of colonies) has been destroyed by Drow and that the Elves are making their way towards the surface. There is only a few days remaining before they arrive. 
* A Grey Druid is discovered trapped under a rockslide. The Druid is dying and begs for death. If the Druid dies, a ring of twisted vines can be looted from the Druid's finger. If the Druid is rescued, they will become very angry and rant about the ""preservation of Balance"", stating that healing magicks are an abomination to the ""natural cycles of the world"". If the party remains in the area, the Druid will begin to try and drive them out. 
* A huge Dwarven vault-door blocks the party's passage through an underground area. Sleeping in a nearby chamber is a Grey Druid of an unusual race for the Order. The Druid cannot be woken by any means short of magic, and there is no way past the vault-door (it is highly enchanted with Abjuration magicks). If the party cannot wake the Druid, they can search the Druid and find a phrase written in Draconic. Its a magical trigger for the vault-door. Inside the vault is a Black Dragon that has been imprisoned for centuries. Its very angry and very happy to be released. Its name is Venomfang and its legendary. When the vault is opened, the Druid will wake and rage at the party's stupidity. Violence is most likely to follow.
* While the party is underground they will be approached by a Grey Druid who asks for their aid in quelling a war between two intelligent species. The war is threatening to destroy the entire ecosystem and spill out onto the surface world. They party will be outnumbered 10-to-1 if they agree, and will soon find themselves in the middle of the front lines, surrounded. The Druid's Order is coming to aid, but they will arrive too late. 
* The party comes across a strange sight - a group of 4 Grey Druids worshiping at a standing circle of stones deep, deep underground. The area is lit with strange glowing fungus, and a large, dead, Carrion Crawler is sprawled across the sacrificial slab. Its been cut open and candles have been tucked inside, and lit. The Druids are chanting in some language (Infernal) and are attempting to summon a demon to help them destroy a particularly nasty Illithid colony in the area. If the party interferes, the Druids will flee.

#The wall     
      
In ancient times, the god of death was Jergal. He was always an uncaring and distant god, wanting everyone to die at their predestined time.  
During his reign, the faithless were mearly made into his servants, going off to attack sentient undead that have delayed their due death.    
With the massive amount of servants under his possession, he was undeniably the most powerful god in the realms. But this eventually grew tiring to Jergal. He wished for some sort of challenge, and his wish came true.     
    
A triad of powerful mortals came. They wished for Jergal's spot as lord of death. He gave them his power, but decided to do a few competitions first to see who would get which aspects.    
Eventually another god intervened, Malar the god of the hunt. He wished for an aspect of death, and so Jergal gave him one: savage death.     
To the other three he gave different aspects.     
To Bane he gave death by attrition, dying due to a lack of resources.     
To Bhaal he gave death by assination, premature death by another being    
And lastly to Mrykul he gave death by entropy, the strongest but slowest aspect of death.     
    
With Mrykul being the new lord of death, Jergal resigned to being a scribe of death. He maintained his immense power, but chose not to use it.     
Mrykul erected a wall that would absorb the faithless souls into it. They would be slowly converted into a sludge like essence that merged with the other faithless. A truly horrific end from an incredibly evil person.      
      
During the time of troubles, Cyric the mad god claimed the seat of god of death due to the instability of the pantheon. He maintained the wall as he found enjoyment in the torment of others. But the other gods managed to defeat him and put in a new person to lead: Kelemvor     
      
Unlike most of the gods, kelemvor was a kind human in life. He wanted no more suffering by the souls of the faithless so he tore down the wall. The good souls then lived in his city on the fugue plane. The evil souls were left to the former gods of death to be tormented.     
    
But this lead to the brave and righteous mortals to be reckless and throw away their lives as they did not fear the god of death anymore. Crafty and evil mortals did nothing as they feared Kelemvor throwing them to the aspects of death. This disrupted the balance of the gods as both evil and good gods lost followers. He was outed by Cyric and found guilty of ""incompetence via humanity.""     
So Kelemvor lost all his humanity. He reconstructed the wall and sucked the color out from his realm. It became not a place with black or white, but uncaring gray.     
     
#The seeds of rebellion     
      
About a millennia ago, a certain mortal died. Their name, race, gender and entire life before has long been forgotten, but what they turned into after death was a weak celestial eladrin.      
     
He took on the name of Zadike and found himself easily making friends among the lands of Arborea. He eventually found that he could go between the planes by finding portals. He journeyed through all the different planes and was amazed at how each one was different. While he tended to prefer the more chaotic and good planes, he managed to find some excitement evading devils, fighting off demons, and sneaking past modrons.      
      
After a long trek through pandemonium, he found a portal to a new realm. This land was full of gray with the very ground beneath his feet being made of crushed bones. He saw a glimmering structure in the distance and followed it.     
On his way there, he saw several mortal souls walking towards the same structure. Most of them disappeared with an outsider of a specific alignment planeshifting them out of the plane. But the ones who didn't looked in particularly rough shape.    
They were naked with gaunt bodies. Some even had injuries that would kill a living mortal, but they managed to work through the pain.   
When Zadike asked them why they were going to the structure, they just said that they felt like they had to. Like some sort of way to relieve them of their pain.     
    
When Zadike made it to the structure, he found it to be a massive crystaline city with a wall that appeared to be made of flesh around it. The flesh was crying out in pain in a thousand different voices.    
There were massive lines of souls awaiting their judgement at the palace in the center of the city. According to the souls there, they felt no pain in the city, but had to wait immense amounts of time. Upwards of 100s of years to get to the center.    
Occasionally a devil would planeshift in and try to bargain with one of the souls. They would take the soul back to the 9 hells and become a lemure. Not a fate anyone would wish, but the alternative must have been so much worse.    
     
Zadike witnessed what happened what happened to the souls that made it to the palace. The masked lord of death himself would deem them to be false or faithless. The false misunderstood their gods and were forced to work as servants of Kelemvor. The faithless did not worship any gods and were thrown into the walls to be turned into the sludge that made up the wall.     
     
An alarm was rung, apparently an invasion of demons. They attempted to rip the souls out of the wall and take them back to the abyss. While the false managed to wipe out most of the demons, a few escaped. Zadike being an outsider himself ripped out a pair of souls and quickly planeshifted back to arborea.     
      
One was a human baby's soul who was stillborn. While most babies get sent to their parent's gods, his parents didn't worship any gods. So he was thrown into the wall to suffer with his parents.     
   
The other was a Hobgoblin woman who didn't worship any gods. She found that all of her gods were corrupting influences, so she hoped to make herself better by completely rejecting them. While she lived a good life, she was thrown into the wall for not having any patron gods.      
       
Zadike was furious at this and declared that he would give justice to the faithless souls. He did not care about what the gods thought of the neccessity of the wall. Those souls deserved a happy and free afterlife.     
     
Over the next several centuries he made several allies.   
He got the boon of several other celestial eladrin who were appalled at this act of subjugation.    
He discovered a mysterious woman who called herself the Raven Queen. Apparently she was the first soul who pulled herself out of the wall. She had saved many faithless by bringing them to the prime material and granting them her power. But this came at cost of their memory. These people were known as Hexblades (credit goes to u/link_maxwell and [his post on the raven queen](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9jt3z5/the_raven_queen_and_hexblades/).)     
Zadike encountered an Aboleth named Tymoth. He had been shown the error of his ways by the balance card from a deck of many things he owned. He now wanted to work with Zadike to destroy the wall of the faithless so mortals could be free of the god's influence.     
       
Zadike, The Raven Queen, and Tymoth all established their alliance against the wall of the faithless. This alliance would be known as The Violet Hyacinths, a flower representing the forgiveness they are giving to the faithless souls.     
       
#The branches of the flower    
     
Each of the leaders of The Violet Hyacinths has a different role.     
      
The Raven Queen's section of The Violet Hyacinths is known as the hex warriors. She offers mortals the chance to live again by converting them into hexblades. She then sends them back to the prime material with a new body and no memories. Her presence cannot be known to the hexblades until after their death.    
Due to this, many people hardly know about the Raven Queen's existence, let alone that she is a part of The Violet Hyacinths. Even within the Violet Hyacinths, only Zadike and Tymoth know that she is commanding the hex warriors. The rest of the alliance believes the leader of the hex warriors to be some sort of unseelie fey.      
       
Zadike has his section of The Violet Hyacinths named the jailbreakers. Their purpose is to free souls who are already trapped within the wall. The jailbreakers are mostly made up of chaotic good petitioners and celestial eladrin. They have two main types of missions within the fugue plane: raids and underminings.    
During raids, large armies of jailbreakers planeshift into the fugue plant and attack. They rip more souls out of the wall while the false try to fight back. Many celestial eladrin lose their lives in raids, but they are reformed on Arborea afterward.    
During underminings, some of The Raven Queen's spies on the abyss hear about demons coming into the fugue plane to steal souls. So he sends out a small amount of jailbreakers to deal with them. When the demons take the souls, the jailbreakers kill the demons and take the soul back to Arborea. Underminings tend to be more effective as the false are far too busy dealing with the demons to attack the jailbreakers.      
      
And lastly Tymoth's section of The Violet Hyacinths is known as the solvent. He works in the prime material plane to work against Kelemvor's followers and weaken the god of death. He uses his enslaving abilities to great effect.     
Sometimes, he will enslave a priest of Kelemvor and spread doubt about the god of death. Preaching in the streets about how the wall of the faithless is taking innocent souls for merely not worshiping the supposedly good gods.     
He can also enslave some humanoids and have them destroy temples to Kelemvor, hoping to reduce his worshipers.     
But Tymoth uses his enslaving abilities carefully as to cause as little injury as possible. The people he enslaves are usually long lived races like dwarves and elves so he doesn't waste too much of their life under his control. If someone enslaved under him gets injured, he will contact some of the celestial eladrin loyal to him to heal them up. He makes sure to never have someone enslaved too long as he wants people to live their lives.     
Tymoth also works with several mortals on the prime material. He is a very powerful wizard and can travel to many places with his teleport spell. Any place is open to him so long as it contains water. And there he sends out adventurers to go retrieve artifacts that can help in the war of flowers in exchange for some artifacts that won't be useful to their crusade. He has a vast collection from his immense age, so he can grant the wish of whoever is willing to work for him.     
       
#Death's rebuke     
     
Of course Kelemvor isn't happy with The Violet Hyacinths. He has scryed all throughout the planes, but he can never find their base. That's because of several layers of illusion magic that the leaders of The Violet Hyacinths have overlayed on their base in Arborea.     
      
Kelemvor has much greater power than The Violet Hyacinths and could wipe them out if he could find them. But all he can do is fortify his crystal city. He has trained his false to be much stronger fighters and will sometimes participate in stopping raids and underminings himself.     
But no matter what he does, the chaos that The Violet Hyacinths brings always has a few souls leave the wall when they attack.     
     
Kelemvor has petitioned the other gods for assistance, but most have stayed silent on the issue. In truth, most of the chaotic and good gods despise the wall but see it as a necessary evil. They would support The Violet Hyacinths if they could, but choose not to participate in the battle at all.    
However he has gotten major support from the devils as Asmodeus finds the freedom that The Violet Hyacinths gives threatening the souls from going to the 9 hells. Although he can only give so many as he has to deal with his own planar war.     
    
The truth is that neither side winning will be a good outcome.   
If The Violet Hyacinths win, then the gods will start to lose their power again as the wall is destroyed and their followers lose faith. The great old ones will descend on the defenseless world and make it a non euclidean nightmare.    
If Kelemvor wins, then there will be no hope for any faithless soul. They will be forced into an endless decay into nothingness where their only feeling is pain.     
      
#Plot hooks     
     
Now it's time to implement this war into campaigns. Just because the war is mostly fought in the fugue plane, it doesn't mean that it can't spill over to the prime material.    
     
Your players will likely have to declare allegiance to one side or the other. Any clerics or religious characters will likely go to Kelemvor's side as he represents godhood. However people who care more about mortals than the gods will likely want to join The Violet Hyacinth's side as they fight for mortal independence from gods.    
     
So here are 5 plot hooks for each side:    
      
Kelemvor:    
    
- A temple to Kelemvor was destroyed by a normally peaceful tribe of orcs. They have no memory of attacking the temple.     
- A thief has stolen a major artifact from a Kelemvor clergy that stops undead from attacking. Undead from a necromancer loyal to Tymoth start attacking the city. They ignore people and prefer to just attack religious structures.    
- Tobias Muller, a city guard has asked the players to investigate a disturbance. He has heard about a large group people preaching against the gods. Blasphemy is illegal in this city and they must be reprimanded.   
- A false has been sent by Kelemvor to ask the players to kill a hexblade. The hexblade themselves is clueless about The Violet Hyacinths and Kelemvor.     
- Someone has been breaking into the scribes' vaults in the city and have been erasing any mention of Kelemvor's church. This is turns out to be a group of espionage artists that work for Tymoth     
     
The Violet Hyacinths:     
      
- Tymoth starts to use the sending spell to contact the players. He will ask them to steal an artifact from a kelemvor clergy that repels undead. If they do, he'll have an agent deliver a large package of gold to them.    
- Tymoth meets with the players while polymorphed into a human. He will request them to go retrieve a mysterious artifact in the jungle. Really what this artifact does is reveal any souls nearby, which will be useful for the jailbreakers.     
- A celestial eladrin is healing an injured person in the woods. This person was enslaved by Tymoth for a short period, but accidentally got hurt. The eladrin asks if the players could bring them back to town as she can't be seen.     
- The players find an amulet with the power to cast true ressurection once. Tymoth sends a human agent to pay them a sizable sum and offer to join a prestigious faction.      
- Tymoth himself meets with the players. He has seen their feats and wishes them to join his crusade. Using some of his illusion magic, he depicts the war of flowers that is waging on the fugue plane.      
        
Sorry if these plot hooks aren't very good, they're my weak suit.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,15,51,"**Summary:** A fey mongoose who consumed the *melam* (divine splendor) of his servant-turned-goddess, Ninkilim is a god filled with fury against serpents, poisons, and those who would desecrate nature's lands. 

**Alignment:** Chaotic Good

**Domains:** Nature, War

**Titles:** The Noble Mongoose

**Symbol:** A golden right-facing mongoose rampant, treading upon a left-facing red snake

**Manifestations:** An ethereal golden mongoose that can change in size

**Virtues:** Courage, protection, vengeance

**Backstory:** The story of Ninkilim begins with his encounter with Ningirima, a young girl who would later become a popular goddess of protection and magic. An adventurous girl, Ningirima was in the forest when she accidentally discovered a hidden temple of the serpentine Nirah, a secretive and evil servant of Ishtaran (god of boundaries). There, she overheard the priests' plans to force her clan off of their land. Ningirima ran back to her village, pursued by Nirah's snakes. Ninkilim, a local fey of the forest, took pity on the girl and appeared in the form of a mongoose to protect her. In gratitude, Ningirima made a pact with Ninkilim, who manifested as her loyal mongoose familiar. 

As a reward for her later brave deeds, including leading resistance movements against Nirah's servants, she was elevated to godhood. However, Nirah poisoned Ningirima with the very wine she was celebrating with, and the goddess was to lay in eternal pain from the incurable venom. Ninkilim, seeing his servant in such a sorry state, took her *melam* into himself so that she could pass on in peace. Consumption by grief turned to fury against serpents and poison in all their forms. 

**Organization:** Hunter-gatherer tribes surviving in pockets and on edges of the empire have always respected the fey, but Ninkilim's elevation to godhood made him an object of worship for the first time. Many druids, some of whom tend to be more militant in their defense of the wilderness, have also come to revere Ninkilim, and they have been known to team up with tribal leaders in times of self-defense from those who would seek to deprive them of land. Ninkilim is something like the equivalent of a ""folk saint"" in that he has no organized church but nonetheless has a large, open, and rapidly spreading cult with certain shared practices, such as noisemaking ceremonies, meditation in the wilderness, and the occasional ritual sacrifice of snakes. Ninkilim is a god who inspires rather than commands, and expects his followers to internalize his tenets while acting on their own accord. However, the most devout followers of Ninkilim are expected to abstain from all mind-altering substances, such as alcohol, that ""poison"" the body and soul. Some extreme followers also reject medicines they perceive as too associated with the so-called ""civilized"" world. 

**Relationships:** All deities associated with serpents and poison are dire enemies of Ninkilim, even if they possess healing attributes. His priests' devotion to fighting evil is highly respected by priests of the Sevenfold Way, even if they are rather reluctant to incorporate him into their worship. Because some extremist druids of Ninkilim have been known for their violence against loggers and farmers, the relationship between him and agricultural gods is strained. However, he is an ally of other nature deities, such as Amurru (a storm god) and Ningikuga (goddess of marshes), as well as various fey, elementals, and nature spirits. 

**Tenets:**

* Seek out and destroy poisonous forces wherever you can find them, whether in the enemy or within yourself. 

* Tame your rage and indignation, so that they may be wielded as weapons against evil.

* Embody the fierce justice of the Noble Mongoose, so that one's intuition will never lead you off the path of righteousness. ",1,"Ninkilim, the Noble Mongoose, the fey-god serpent-slayer"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,351,"**Summary:** Geshtinanna is the prophetess of the gods and minor goddess of dreams, unwillingly imprisoned and immortalized in the Underworld for her rebellion against fate.

**Alignment:** Neutral

**Domains:** Knowledge, Trickery

**Worshipers:** Diviners, exorcists, prisoners, victims of torture

**Titles:** The Chained Lady

**Symbol:** An eye shedding three tears of blood

**Manifestations:** No physical manifestations; appears exclusively in dreams (see below) 

**Virtues:** Endurance, neutrality, secrecy

**Backstory:** Geshtinanna was born as a mortal aasimar with the rare gift of foresight into the future. It was a great blessing and curse, for she despaired at the thought of losing her brother, Dumuzid, to the clutches of death at the hands of demons. In an effort to thwart the demons and Dumuzid's fate, she hid and protected him zealously, even as the demons tortured her in hopes of making her give up her secrets. Although she withstood the torture, the other gods punished Geshtinanna's attempt to cheat death by imprisoning her in the Underworld, turning her into a goddess to live out her fate eternally. Known as the Chained Lady, she continues to predict the movements of evil forces conspiring against mortals and the gods, though it is suspected that she holds more secrets and agendas than she would like others to believe. Because she is restricted to the Underworld, she does not manifest in the world of the living, but through dreams, where she appears as a bloodied woman in shackles. Her most devout followers carry out her commands in utter secrecy to avoid detection, though many ordinary people occasionally pray to her before sleep as well when they are desperate for divine guidance. 

*Note: In this universe, aasimar are divinely descended or otherwise god-touched people who differ from others in that they have the potential to be elevated to godhood under certain conditions. Therefore, many aasimar become adventurers to gain renown and receive divinity as a reward for their deeds done in service of the gods.*
 
**Organization:** Because Geshtinanna speaks individually and directly to her followers, there is no need for a centralized authority. Geshtinanna’s devout are either called to act on her inscrutable desires, or directed to form small cells. These cells are constantly forming and disbanding and may never even interact with each other directly. Because of this, it is difficult to ascertain the number of cells in the realms, but the number is estimated to be quite small. They have no consistent base of operations, but tend to settle temporarily in places overlooked by others, such as slums and abandoned places. There are no temples dedicated to Geshtinanna because of the risk of discovery, but priests may carry “travel altars” full of components whose true significance is only known to the carrier. Offerings to Geshtinanna, which are preferably buried underground to facilitate their travel to the goddess, are nearly indistinguishable from general offerings to the mortal dead. After all, Geshtinanna did not wish to become a goddess kept by the other deities, and her secret wish is for her followers to free her of her chains so that she may return to the mortal world to die a proper death. After that, offerings to her will cease, and she will fade away like any spirit who is not regularly nourished. 

**Relationships:** Worship of Geshtinanna is unsurprisingly and officially condemned by all churches of the Sevenfold Way, with the harshest being the priesthood of Nergal (god of the Underworld), though there are said to be heretical sympathizers among Inanna’s (goddess of love) devout. Although Geshtinanna is begrudgingly recognized for her value to the other gods, her place among them is considered a punishment for her rebellion, making her unsuitable for worship. (This does not stop laypeople from praying to her for guidance, but they are not truly considered worshipers.) Because Geshtinanna secretly seeks to sabotage the gods and demons responsible for imprisoning her in the Underworld, she sometimes directs her followers to undermine followers of those gods, but largely leaves other deities and their followers alone. Geshtinanna enjoys good relations with her brother Dumuzid. Though their priesthoods interact rarely, Geshtinanna’s followers may provide support from the shadows. 

**Tenets:**

* Eschew open praise and condemnation for yourself. Humble and exalt yourself before no one but the Chained Lady. 

* Indulge one’s curiosity only with the blessing of the Chained Lady. Some knowledge is better kept secret. 

* Distance oneself from other disputes and loyalties irrelevant to the Chained Lady. ",1,"Geshtinanna, the Chained Lady, divine prophetess of the gods"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,70,1361,"Halo was my favorite game for all of high school. It has bled into my subconscious and has affected the way I design encounters since day one. Here's the big points.


1. Break the enemy into rankings
----

* In Halo you have varying enemies rankings that each have their own abilities and level of difficulty. 
* Grunts - Elites - Brutes - Jackals - Hunters - uhhh, the others
* Fourth Edition did this really well with the various types of each creature and giving each one a role
* In 5e you can do this by assigning different monsters from the Monster Manual to each role
* Some are already grouped like this through lore, but you can use or ignore this. CREATE YOUR OWN LORE
* Example using the basic lore of D&amp;D: Goblins (grunts), Orcs (elites), Bugbears (hunters), stirges (drones), hobgoblins (jackals)
* I would use these stats to create my own, rooted in my own world. 
* FURTHER - in Halo, as you progress, each of these rankings has sub-ranks inside of them. There are many variations of the grunts and elites throughout all of Halo 1, adding more variety. 
* You can accomplish this by giving them different weapons, more health, and spells 

2. Group the rankings into Encounter Groups
---

* In Halo there are several encounter groups that you will run into over and over again
* You could break these down into a random encounter table and use it to build your own

1d8|Encounter Group
---|---
1.| 2d6 grunts
2.| 2d4 grunts, 1d2 Elites
3.| 2d6 grunts, 1d2 Elites
4.| 2 Hunters
5.| Swarm of drones
6.| 2d4 jackals
7.| d4 jackals, 1 elite
8.| 2d4 grunts, d4 jackals, 1 elite

* That might be an oversimplification, but still, using that you can have a base encounter chart with different locations
* You can get creative by expanding each of the encounter groups to include the different types of each ranking.

1d4|Grunt Encounters
---|---
1.| 2d6 grunts fucking around
2.| d4 kamikaze grunts
3.| d6 grunts, d2 fuelrod grunts
4.| d4 fleeing grunts

* It gets more and more complex and detailed as you combine the ranking types and the encounter groups

1d4|City Encounters
---|---
1.| d4 kamikaze grunts, d2 sniper jackals
2.| d2 fuelrod grunts, d6 grunts, sword elite
3.| 2 hunters, d6 grunts fucking around
4.| d4 assassin elites

* You can customize your own encounter groups to show the flavor of each area
* The goal is to have a bunch of encounter groups that you can mix and match to keep the encounters focused on the same rival force, but keep the encounters fresh and new each time

3. Overwhelm the PCs
----

* The best parts of Halo are when you have way too much to do
* The flood are on all sides of you and won't stop coming till you move on
* Do not be afraid to overwhelm your PCs by throwing more than one encounter group at them at once
* Or throw them one after another, in a wave-style of encounter
* Your players will get creative to get out of these situations
* It's totally normal for a player or two to go down in an encounter, it's why they have short rests
* If you're really worried about the party being beaten up too much, give them more toys--

4. Vehicles are toys designed to make you feel EPIC
----

* Vehicles serve one purpose in Halo: to allow the player to face more enemies at once, giving encounters a grander scale
* A vehicle is a toy for the player to use
* Other toys include the power weapons
* Vehicles and power weapons are the equivalent of magic items in DnD
* If you give the players a Necklace of Fireball, you SHOULD be throwing a lot more opponents at them at once, specifically squisher groups of grunts
* If you give them a +1 sword, you should be throwing opponents with more health and AC
* I often see people asking how to handle *accidentally* giving the players items that are too powerful so that they end up stomping all encounters
* This. Should. Not. Happen. The reason being - you can ALWAYS throw bigger and badder things at your players. Finding the right balance takes time, but always opt for giving them more they can handle, and then mitigating when it seems like too much.

5. OVERWHELM THE PCS
----

* Yes, this one gets a second chance.
* I'm serious people. You need to try this. I know it might make you nervous. I know you fear that your friends and players will think you're being mean.
* But trust me. Your players will find a way to make it out. Especially if you've given them toys to play with.
* This is why I am never worried about handing out potions and strange, single/limited-use magic items all the time. Because one day they'll remember they have it and it will save the day. And it will be memorable.

5b. Here's how I do it
---

When it comes to designing encounters I follow these basic rules

* **The opponents Hit Dice should be AT LEAST equal to the PCs**, which means if there are 5 level 3 players, that's 15HD to spend. So 15 1HD opponents, 2 7HD opponents, 1 big 15HD opponent. This works out to a good encounter 95% of the time.
* **The opponent should get 1 attack per 2 PCs**, at least. So in any given round against 5 PCs, you should be rolling 2-3 attacks. MINIMUM. Action economy is a big thing in 5e and you need to level the playing field.
* **Their to-hit bonus should be their HD + 2** (for proficiency). This is not always sound, but it's a good rule of thumb. 
* **Their damage bonus should be 2 at a minimum**. So even 3 attacks at 1d6 each can do a max of 24 damage. 
* **I always increase the number of dice they roll before the die type**. So 2d6 before 1d8. 
* **I always increase the number of dice they roll before increasing their damage bonus**. So the big 15HD bruiser might roll 6d6+2 instead of 2d6+12. Rolling dice is fun. 
* **For every 5HD an opponent has, give them an extra attack**. So the 2 7HD opponents will each attack twice. 

Alot of these guidelines are based on 5e's proficiency scale and player-leveling. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are some of the bigger things I've taken from Halo. I hope you learned at least one thing from this. 

If you want to see *some* of these things in action, check out my book. 

It's called [Haunted](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258940/Haunted).

It has 9 unique locations, a d20 encounter table filled with mostly social encounters, and some hidden things to encourage exploration and experimentation. It's everything *I* need to run an adventure, written in a way that helps me the most. So hopefully you find something in that as well. Plus any money I make on it goes to getting my Kitty the surgery she needs.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,110,"Here you go, guys, another deity for your campaign! This time, I bring you another demon lord, one whose ultimate goal is to destroy all conaciousness and replace it with hisnown. I hive you, **D'Borrad, Demon Lord of Deindividuation!**

-----

**Name**: D'borrad (pronounced Deh-BOH-Rad)

**Titles**: The Hive

**Divine rank**: Demon Lord

**Position**: Demon Lord of Deindividuation, Loss of Identity and the Collective

**Holy symbol**: A demonic hand stabbing a wasp with its fingernail

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Cleric alignments**: Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Evil

**Portfolio**: The collective, loss of identity and self, peer pressure, mobs, criminal organizations, exploitation, slavery

**Domains**: Domination, Charm, Corruption, Tyranny

**Allies**: None

**Enemies**: Pretty much every other god, in particular Pelor, Lathander, Selûne, Bane, Hextor, Kelemvor, Olidammara, Mask, Oghma, Vecna, Shar, Tempus, Tymora, Dispater

**Favored weapon**: Cat of Nine Tails

-----

**Appearance**:

D'borrad is truly harrowing to behold. The Hive is basically a human-looking head as tall as a man, with a cruel grinning face, yellow eyes with oblong pupils like an octopus, and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. From his neck stump, countless lashing tentacles sprout which he can stick into humanoid heads to suck out their brains and control the bodies like puppets. His most distinguishing, and disgusting, feature, however, is his brain, which is double the size of his head and can be seen pulsating beneath his greenish yellow skin. Tumors and boils constantly form and pop from his brain, spewing forth disgusting ichor that can burn the skin and poison the body and mind. D'borrad gets around by using his tentacles, floating in the air or possessing enough humanoid bodies to carry him around, making him look like some sort of deformed multi-legged insect. In the mortal realm, the Hive manifests taking over mortals serving him completely and destroying their will with his consciousness. After commanding his minions, his consciousness leaves the mortal body, leaving an empty husk with falls to the ground unconscious and doomed to never awaken.

-----

**Abyssal layer**:

D'borrad's abyssal layer is Fractorium, layer number 214. Fractorium is a mindblowingly enormous city that stretches both to the horizon and to the sky seemingly endlessly. The city is a mockery of every urban sprawl imaginable. It has residential areas choked with disease and overpopulation, factories spewing choking smoke and toxic chemicals while producing bland products for mass consumption and weapons of war, barracks full of nameless and faceless soldiers constantly dying and being replaced by new recruits in senseless warfare, enormous sewers overrunning with filth and full of disgusting creatures like slimes, oozes, fungi and otyughs. In the middle of the city, a tower stretches beyond sight, calle the Spine. From the top of the Spine, D'Borrad rules with an iron fist, spewing order after order and indulging in devouring and brainwashing victims. Those he brainwashes he sends as his emissaries throughout Fractorium to have his orders followed, while the remains of those he consumes are thrown out the window to rain viscera on those below. The acrid smell of smoke, feces and decomposing bodies assaults any visitors, and particles of unnameable contaminants choke the lungs and irritate the eyes. The layer's demons serve as overseers, generals and bosses to the endless masses of tortured souls there. No mortal soul that ends in Fractorium will ever somehow manage to gain power and become a demon: they are fodder for the great machine and nothing more.

-----

**Backstory**:

Every organization, if it becomes big and bloated enough, can become dehumanizing. People become cogs in a machine, the goals of the organization become more important than the individuals that compose it, they become expendable. People lose themselves, their ambitions, their ideals. Sometimes, a mob forms, where people, in the throes of collective hysteria and rage, commit attrocities they would never contemplate otherwise. In this collective madness, D'borrad thrives. The Demon Lord of Deindividuation's goal is the destruction of self, making all living souls subservient to his will, and so far, he has been frightfully successful. Every mortal organization is vulnerable to D'Borrad's influence, and those he manages to get his hands on become fonts of evil in the mortal realm, which can spread his evil quite subtly.

-----

**Dogma, clergy and temples**:

The dark church of D'Borrad has no need for complicated dogma, they simply follow orders. To worship D'Borrad is to simply serve him to the letter. Priests of D'Borrad commune with his consciousness for instructions, and spread the word to their subordinates. The lower ranks of his faithful still cling to individuality, and believe that with good service they will gain power and fulfill their ambitions. They are half right: as faithful go up in the church's hierarchy, they do gain power, sometimes frightfully so, but their ambitions disappear completely as they become mere extensions of the Hive's will. This is actually the church's biggest weakness: the lower ranks, still being individuals for the most part, are more prone to making judgment calls or disobeying orders, which limits the church's effectiveness. Upper members, however, are powerful and effective agents who do not hesitate or second-guess their goals and function.

Worshippers of the Hive are master inflitrators, joining an organization and quickly becoming part of its hierarchy. The upper members of the church are always talented, intelligent and accomplished people who are attractive to an organization's leadership, and they are charming and charismatic. As soon as they join, they start to subtly shift the organization's goals into aligning with the Hive's goals, and identify potential recruits to indoctrinate. Preferred organizations include military outfits, criminal cartels and local governments, preferably those with strict hierarchies and chains of command. As they take control of one organization, it opens windows into other organizations to infiltrate: taking over a criminal cartel can cause the local city guard to become desperate for assistance, a military outfit can produce contacts with the government that supervises it, a local soup kitchen can allow infiltration of an enemy church. Every organization infiltrated also provides resources for all others. The criminal cartel might receive manpower or weaponry from the military outfit, or money from the alms being collected by the religious organization. In this way, D'Borrad's church slowly forms a web of influence that can bring an entire city to its knees.

As an organization becomes more and more corrupted by the Hive's influence, eventually its leadership become part of the Hive himself. The top leaders of the organization will suddenly get their consciousness destroyed, and D'Borrad will manifest directly through them to give direct orders. Followers of D'Borrad see this as the ultimate blessing of their lord, becoming one with him and thus divine, but they wouldn't be so excited if they knew what was really happening: their soul is destroyed, consumed by the Hive, and their body is merely a puppet to D'Borrad's will. The soul doesn't even fall to the Abyss, it ceases to exist completely.

Clerics and anti-paladins of D'Borrad are frightening in their focus and purpose. They are patient and meticulous in their schemes, and as a unit they are a well-oiled machine. There is no disagreement between them, for they are extensions of D'Borrad's will, and they can field enormous amounts of agents, patsies and cannon fodder.

Part of what makes D'Borrad's church hard to oppose is that his focus on infiltrating and subverting hierarchies makes his machinations seem quite devil-like, and indeed, servants of the Hive when caught will often claim to be working under orders from the Nine Hells. Unless they're specifically looking for Chaotic influence, a paladin or cleric of a Good church will more often than not take this statement at face value and target diabolic cults as a result. This has made D'Borrad a particularly hated enemy of Hell, and specifically of Dispater. As the Archdevil who has purview over cities and organizations, most operations that are attacked because of D'Borrad's schemes are under Dispater's orders, and his meddling is one of the only things that can make the usually stoic Lord of The Second outburst in anger.

**Tenets**:

-You are worth nothing. Only through belonging do you gain worth. Join us.

-Individual power is an illusion. No one person is more powerful than the the collective. Make them join us or destroy them.

-The Hive is your life. Your pleasure, your purpose, your function is all according to his whims. Obey.

-Every group must belong to us. Join them and infect them from within. All must belong to the Hive.

-The Good place worth on individual lives, limiting their effectiveness. They show compassion, making themselves vulnerable to despair. Show them the superiority of our creed. Batter them with our troops, demoralize them with corruption and abuse. Destroy their spirit and replace it with our glorious oneness.

-Our consciousness is a disease. Replace it with the perfection of the Hive. Destroy your self and become one with a god.

**D'Borrad's Anti-Paladins' Code**:

-I am the Hive and the Hive is me. Every action I take is by his will and for his purpose.

-Every organization is just fodder for the Hive. I will destroy it or bring it to heel.

-I am an expression of the Hive's will, all are lesser. Only those who serve the Hive are my equals, for they are the Hive, and the Hive is me.

-The Hive is many. I will cooperate with other servants of my lord, use our numbers and power to overwhelm our enemies.

-All churches are my enemy. Every god is merely a pretender to the Hive's greatness. I will destroy them.

**Sects and Cults**:

-**Khar Madum**: Khar Madum is a dwarven city like any other. It's located under a mountain that has slight volcanic activity, with a small river of lava and natural gas an steam vents that keep the city warm and power many of its devices. There are wealthy mines with both iron and copper veins and many gemstones. The city has a lucrative business of weapon production and export. Its citizens are unusually stoic but efficient dwarves, and their products are strangely lacking in detail but nonetheless solid dwarven craftsmanship. The dwarves work in meticulously well-timed shifts, ensuring that the forges run at every hour of the day, and they have a local militia for protection and that directs any outsiders to inns within the city to keep them away from the forges for their protection. In the inns quarter there are bureocratic buldings where dwarven employees receive outsiders to negotiate for product. Overall, other than a couple of idiosyncrasies, it's just a dwarven city like any other.

If outsiders knew what Khar Madum was hiding, the city would get razed to the ground.

Khar Madum is a city that has been completely taken over by the Hive. Every single dwarf in the city has been completely taken over by D'Borrad, their self completely destroyed and their body merely a puppet to his will. The Hive uses Khar Madum as a city-sized weapons factory for his other operations within the mortal realm, as well as a bargaining chip to plant influence within other cities to spread his influence. While the stated reason the local militia keeps outsiders out of the forges is for their security, it's actually because the city's demonic influence is most obvious there. The dwarves working the forges are covered in filth and disease, never stopping their work for any kind of grooming or physical need beyond the least amount of rest and sustenance required to function. They will urinate and void themselves as they work without any regard for hygiene, and when one of them has a fatal accident or dies from exhaustion, another will instantly take their place without missing a beat. Female dwarves are constantly pregnant, and every dwarven child born is made to age artifically to adult age and immediately put to work. The inns quarter provides for visitors to avoid suspicion, but any visitors who are identified as a potential recruit or enemy of the Hive quietly disappear, either taken to be indoctrinated or exterminated and their body thrown into the lava river to get rid of the evidence.

Within the depths of the mines within Khar Madum lives a great wyrm deep dragon, who serves as the brain of the city. Its will has been destroyed and replaced with D'Borrad's consciousness, and it uses its dominating breath to keep control of the dwarves. Were the deep dragon to be slain, the effect to the city would be catastrophic. Having no will, the dwarves would probably fall over and die of starvation and dehydration, or even more alarming, the artifically aged former baby dwarves might all start crying as they develop consciousness for the first tine, an entire city of adult-bodied newborns.

-**The Iron War**: The Iron War is an ongoing conflict between the armies of the city state of Tepet (led by the elf First Citizen Francion Mortimor) and the kingdom of Balornos (led by human King Balor the Blind). The war has been going on for over 150 years so far, and it is currently in a stalemate and limited to skirmishes, with a major war offensive happening every decade or so. Other nations habitually participate as an ally for either side, but no outside nation knows precisely why the two nations went to war.

The reason is simple: Balornos is under the influence of D'Borrad and Tepet is led by Dispater, with the war serving as the most open battleground between both fiends. Balor the Blind is one of D'Borrad's manifestations in the material realm, and Francion Mortimor is a warlock under Dispater's service. The major offensives occur when portals to the Nine Hells or the Abyss open and fiendish forces can join the fray.

-**The Brotherhood of the One Fang**: The Brotherhood of the One Fang is a vampire coven that serves D'Borrad, infiltrating cities and creating new vampire spawn that become subservient to him. Led by the half-elven vampire lord Kuornos, the Brotherhood has focused in infiltrating various criminal organizations across the land, and many a city's criminal underworld is under full control of vampires serving D'Borrad. 

-----

**Allies and enemies**:

D'Borrad has no allies. His ultimate goal of destroying all free will and replacing it with himself does not lend itself to cooperation with anyone, and all gods either hate him directly or hate his meddling in their affairs. All Good and Neutral gods and the gods of the racial pantheons are enemies of the Hive gor obvious reasons. Even evil racial gods like Gruumsh and Kurtulmak lead their followers to oppose D'Borrad when his influence is found out.

Pelor, Lathander and Selûne, as the celestial deities that guide mortals, are bitter enemies of D'Borrad, and their clerics and paladins are some of the most powerful agents of good opposed to the Hive. 

Bane and Hextor hate D'Borrad for his destruction of self. D'Borrad's brand of tyranny is based on replacing other's will with his own, not in domination and subservience, so the gods of tyranny  scoff at what they see as cheating. Also, tyrants are defined both by their rule and by their enemies, so Bane, Hextor and D'Borrad simply cannot coexist.

While he's usually known as the most neutral of deities, Kelemvor vehemently opposes the Hive. D'Borrad destroys the souls of the living and replaces them with his own consciousness, making death meaningless, as any vessel that dies has no soul to lead to the afterlife. Kelemvor sees this state just as abhorrent as undeath, and many clerics of Kelemvor possess spells that allow them to see into a person's soul and detect D'Borrad's influence.

Olidammara and Mask have particular hate for D'Borrad for his minions' tendency to infiltrate criminal organizations, as well as how his destruction of self goes against the individual freedom the espouse.

Oghma, as god of knowledge, opposes D'Borrad for a very simple reason: if all living beings were one consciousness, knowledge would become meaningless, as it would not be shared and no new knowledge would be produced. Agents of Oghma often assist those who oppose the Hive with information about D'Borrad's operations.

Vecna is fascinated by D'Borrad's ability to destroy self and extend his consciousness into others, and his faithful often infiltrate organizations under D'Borrad's influence to try to decipher that particular secret. Any rational mortal would be horrified at imagining what Vecna intends to do with this knowledge.

Not even the nihilistic dogma of Shar wants anything to do with D'Borrad. Shar seeks complete annihilation of existence, not merely the elimination of self. Servants of the Hive who cross followers of Shar are some of the unluckiest of all, as they are promptly hunted down and destroyed by the Lady of Loss's fanatical and mystically powerful faithful.

Tempus knows that, if D'Borrad got his way, war would cease to exist. There would be no causes to fight for and no conflicting ideologies. As such, Tempus's church assists anyone whom opposes D'Borrad. In fact, Tempus has many warriors fighting on Dispater's side in the Iron War.

Tymora opposes D'Borrad for similar reasons to Tempus: there is no need or reason for luck when all of existence is subject to only one will. Many warriors who fight against D'Borrad's minions see their efforts be surprisingly fruitful for some reason, and the Hive's minions tend to fall victim to many accidents and mishaps.

Dispater sees D'Borrad as his archenemy. His particular meddling in the Lord of The Second's affairs incenses him, to the point that it has escalated to actual conflict in the Iron War. Dispater has been willing to ally with other deities to oppose D'Borrad, and even many good deities see Dispater and Hell as a whole as the lesser of two evils in that particular conflict. Those who are privy to the true reasons behind the Iron War are often surprised at seeing a surprising number of clerics and paladins of Good deities fighting alongside Dispater's forces.

A special thanks to my roommate and friend in my D&amp;D group who helped with ideas and brainstorming.

**Gang Summaries**

Each gang is themed along with its preference in methods, inspired by their secondary attribute.

**Tactician Gang**

The tacticians are characterized by heightened **strength**. Assaulting guarded convoys of valuables, or performing precision prisoner rescues, members of this gang excel at group tactics and martial discipline. What makes each different is the role they play in the larger strategy.

**Juggernaut Gang**

The juggernauts are characterized by heightened **constitution**. Mugging, intimidation, murder, or breaking into a vault through brute force alone, members of this gang rely on power through alchemy to succeed. What makes each different is their role as enhanced user or producer.

**Mechanist Gang**

The mechanists are characterized by heightened **intelligence**. Performing flashy, explosive heists or raining down grenades in raids, members of this gang use a variety of gadgets to control the battlefield and incinerate their opponents. What makes each different is the particular invention they bring to combat.

**Shadow Gang**

The shadows are characterized by heightened **wisdom**. Performing untraceable espionage or executing targets in the most secure locations, members of this monastic gang excel through a combination of martial prowess and the fantastic skills of their order. What makes each different is the depth to which they have mastered their doctrine, reflected in differences in capabilities both ordinary and extraordinary. 

**Glamor Gang**

The glamors are characterized by heightened **charisma**. Performing captivating public assassinations or robbing entire parties without a single blow, members of this this gang draw power through a pact to charm all who look upon them. What makes each different is the mask they were given and the effect it has on the onlooker.

###Additional information
This is the first installment of three in a three week series, courtesy of winter break. This short series is a practice run for a plan I have for creating and sharing D&amp;D materials. My main concerns for this weeks part is first, the creatures are not practical to use, the creatures are overstuffed, or that they are not of appropriate strength for their CR. I aimed for strong themes and more interesting options for the DM, but it is a hard mark to hit just right.

Here is a basic outline. Separate, brief sections on method will be included in each of the documents.

**Week 1: Creatures**

Create 5 groups of creatures with a theme based on a primary attribute paired with the other five as secondary attributes. For example this series’ primary is Dexterity, thus Gangs of Thieves, with one gang for Strength (Tacticians), Constitution (Juggernauts), Intelligence (Mechanists), Wisdom (Shadows), and Charisma (Glamors). Each group has 5 creatures of varied CR and a leader. The creatures are meant to be mixed, as their abilities play off one another in a variety of ways.

**Week 2: Encounters**

Create 10 random wilderness or urban encounter built for the Gang of Thieves theme, using the creatures from week 1, but also made to be usable in different settings. I try to limit these to a 1-page encounter, or close to it. These encounters typically take 1-3 hours to complete.

**Week 3: A Short Adventure**

Create 1 short adventure built for the Gang of Thieves theme using the creatures from Week 1 and allowing for opportunities to put in a couple of the random encounters from Week 2. Again, they are planned to be made such that they can be placed in any setting. Sets of initial questions to answer for your own worlds, but also answered for my own in the adventure, will help adapt the adventures to your own homebrewed settings. These adventures are usually around 20-30 pages and typically take 9-12 hours to complete without side quests.
",1,Gang of Thieves - Part 1: Creatures
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,1,88,"Asmarem the Royal has a variety of names from his followers. He Who Is Just, The Genie of Law, the Immutable One, and He Who Slumbered are all terms used throughout the sacred texts of his followers.

**Domains:** 

Asmarem has domain over justice, truth, and djinn. He is a patron with an affinity towards both Tortles and Goblins, however he has no use for those who seek to bring evil or lawlessness. 

**Dogma:** 

Honor of the Spirit – This tenet refers to the respect for all living things that Asmarem requires from his followers. Many of his clergy are peaceful, but Asmarem does not require this from them. He only requires that whenever they must take a life that they are respectful of the eternal spirit that is within all living creatures. 

Heeding Wise Counsel – Asmarem entreats to all of his high priests a djinnling to aid them in their journey, whatever that may be. These djinn are imbued with Asmarem’s sense of Justice and serve as extensions of his divine will. Asmarem requires of his priests that they listen to and carefully consider the advice of their djinn.

**Tenets:** 

Asmarem does little to force his will onto others, but he does ask that his followers aid the clergy of his Church in whatever way that they can. Because those who have djinnlings are gifted with Asmarem’s ideals and morality, the followers are to trust that the clergy would never take more from them than is required at any given time and that they will be justly repayed for what they have given. Additionally, Asmarem requires that his followers understand that whatever they forcibly take from another will be taken from them. 

**Allies of the Faith:** 

Because Asmarem has only recently returned to the world, he has few modern allies to speak of. Justice and Lawful Good deities such as Tyr of the Forgotten Realms, Anubis, Re-Horakhty, and Forseti all have allegiances with Asmarem and their followers and his live in harmony as they seek after a common goal.

**Enemies of the Faith:** 

The Genie of the modern world detest Asmarem. His magic protects his followers from any direct action from other Genie, but they will often promise riches or wishes to powerful sorcerers and warlords to convince them to act against Asmarem’s followers.

**Clergy and Temples:** 

Asmarem’s symbol is a set of gold scales. On one side is a bound scroll and on the other is a flaming eye. Because Asmarem was only freed from his imprisoned state in a recent century, his church and clergy are not as well organized as those of other gods. Within his followers, those who are bonded to djinnling are Priests of the highest order and those within their inner circle are of the second order. There is a third order of priests who are descended from Asmarem’s followers that lived ages ago and still honor his texts and his precepts. These, the *enduring*, hold a special place of honor in the church and are considered to be closer to Asmarem and his will than a typical lay follower. 

Outside of the human world is where the most glorious shrines to Asmarem exist. In the depths of the seas, it is claimed that Tortles have established a magnificent Temple dedicated to the worship of Asmarem. This temple was constructed by the original High Priest of the faith upon the return of Asmarem who freed Asmarem from his magical prison and returned him to the Forgotten Realms.

Additionally, there are Goblin tribes who worship Asmarem. Because he imparts a sense of justice, The First High Priest of Asmarem once indoctrinated a group of marauding Goblins so that he wouldn’t have to kill them. This Goblin bonded with a djinnling of his own and became one of the earliest High Priests of Asmarem after his return to the worlds.

**Holidays and Festivals:** 

Freedom day is celebrated on the first full moon of Spring each year. This is the anniversary of when Asmarem was freed from his magic prison and returned to the world. It is a day of gift giving and celebration for followers of Asmarem.

**Champions and Avatars:** 

The First High Priest – this refers to the Tortle bandit who initially freed Asmarem. Working in his own self-interest, he stole a map detailing the magical traps in the tomb of an ancient sorcerer rumored to have great riches from a thieves’ guild. After bypassing the trip and entering the tomb, he found nothing but a sarcophagus in an empty room. Inside the sarcophagus were a skeleton and a simple clay pot. In a fit of fury, the bandit hurtled the pot at the wall and shattered it into a thousand pieces. In doing so, he freed Asmarem from his trap. Not one to repay good with ill, Asmarem bound him to a djinnling and made him a High Priest of his church. This Tortle developed the powers of a Warlock and established the beginnings of the Church of Asmarem.",1,Asmarem the Royal
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,25,371,"Justice can be complicated. While Bahamut’s Ideals are fairly simple and straightforward, enacting them on a larger scale can be difficult. What happens when two groups have conflicting needs? What happens when enacting Justice will cause other problems? What happens there someone has been so thoroughly wronged that there really is no way to truly make it right?

*“As children and younglings, we are told fantastical stories of heroes that have become enshrined in our legends and histories. But remember that good people do not need to become legends. Good people simply do what is right because Honor demands it.” - Hoku Iosua, Honorbound*

# Divine Names

Commonly referred to as the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the god of Honor. Occasionally he can also be referred to as the Scale of Justice, the Father of Metallic Dragons or, more simply, the Father of Dragons.

# Domains

As one of the most extolled deities in larger population centers, Bahamut’s Ideal of Honor is generally well regarded and manifests itself in the following Domains:

**Honor.** Bahamut’s core domain is Honor. This virtue is easy to praise, but difficult to follow with real dedication. Keeping promises and treating others with respect is simple when the other person is likable, but is not so effortless if the target is disreputable.

**Justice.** The second domain associated with Bahamut is that of Justice. This domain calls for fairness and equity under the laws of the land, providing a means for justice to be sought by anyone, and to mete out punishments as necessary when someone has been wronged.

**Protection.**  The final domain that falls to Bahamut is that of Protection. Providing equity to people that are disenfranchised and  usually involves protecting them from being taken advantage of is a critical part of ensuring that they get justice.

# Dogma

Bahamut’s instructions to his followers are fairly straightforward. They are considered goals rather than strict requirements because honor can be practiced in so many different ways.  While the core dogma is the same for everyone, some of the more common ways these are understood are outlined below.

**Act with Honor.**  Regardless of someone’s cultural upbringing, there are some things considered to be honorable and some others that are shameful. Bahamut compels his followers to pursue the former and avoid the latter.

**Seek Justice in All.** Part of being honorable is adhering to a pursuit of justice and, while that justice can take many forms, it is something that should be done. If someone seeks to be honorable, then pursuing justice is a natural consequence.

# Tenets

While specific standards of Honor vary across cultures, the clergy dedicated to Bahamut often preach the following tenets to the people in their communities.

**Honor Your Word.**  If someone swears an oath, gives a promise, or otherwise commits to something, they should meet the expectation they have set. If they cannot do so, then they should not give their word in the first place.

**Be Forthright**.  Although deception and evasiveness can sometimes be necessary, it is only needed in situations where deception and evasiveness already exist. If everyone were honest and forthright in the first place, then being secretive and indirect wouldn’t be necessary.

**Good Things Come to Those Who Work.** Everybody should work hard and pull their own weight. While charity is nice, and sometimes useful, in an ideal society it shouldn’t be necessary.  People should work for the things they want, and they should live in a society that makes such a life possible.

# Allies of the Faith

As a faith that presents itself as helpful and interested in a greater good, Bahamut has many allies:

## Church of Devotion

Moradin and the church of Devotion are closely aligned with Bahamut.  Almost all of Bahamut’s clergy worship his Ideal in a way that also aligns with Devotion, and many followers of Moradin also treat whatever they have dedicated themselves to with honor and respect. Because of this similarity, members of each faith generally hold the other in esteem.

## Church of Cultivation
Melora calls for her followers to grow and help those around them to grow. Likewise, Bahamut’s followers live with honor and encourage those nearby to do the same. Honor and Growth often happen together, and as such, these faiths are also close. 

## Church of Endurance
The final ally of Honor is Kord and the Ideal of Endurance. Bahamut’s teachings do not shy away from the difficult path that leads to Honor, and for those that would try, Endurance is important. 
# Enemies of the Faith

Despite lofty and noble goals, there are many Ideals that often find themselves in opposition to Bahamut:

## [Church of Hatred](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9zd0ft/hatred_asmodeus/)

While hate can be a powerful motivator to change the world for better or worse, it often compels its followers to act in dishonorable ways in pursuit of change. 

## [Church of Autonomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a5hkj1/autonomy_avandra/)

As a goddess of freedom and choice, Avandra’s followers tend to be averse to the more rigid structure and codes that are present in Bahamut’s dogma and tenets. They often say that his followers “have sticks up their butts.”

## Church of Ambition

A classic enemy of Honor, Tiamat and her Ideal of Ambition tend to conflict with Bahamut because the desire to achieve things can motivate people to utilize  dishonorable methods of pursuing their goals.

# Clergy &amp; Temples

The dedicated clergy and worshippers of Bahamut are often widely accepted in most towns and cities, and even in smaller villages. The clergy are generally organized into three ranks based upon the vows and oaths that are taken by its members.

**Avowed**: The lowest rank is made up of acolytes that have taken a vow relating to Bahamut and his church. The only specific requirement is that the vow must contain a promise to serve a community or someone in the community.

**Oathsworn:**  When an Avowed is able to fulfill their sworn responsibilities, they can choose to take an Oath. Generally, an Oath made for this rank is focused on something deeply personal, and includes a larger scope.

**Honorbound:**  Those that have upheld their Oaths long enough are eventually elevated to the title of Honorbound. Members of this rank often serve as advisers and counsel to governments.

## Temple Designs

In smaller towns, temples to Bahamut often double as courtrooms and centers of the legal system. Even in larger settlements, this aesthetic is maintained, despite the presence of  their own dedicated legal buildings. Lofty columns and wide staircases are common on the exteriors, and open hallways with tall ceilings are normal inside. Worship areas tend to be spacious and elegant, but not too heavily decorated. Seating within is arranged in an orderly fashion, and is likely to be mostly benches or pews, depending on the wealth of the particular temple.

## Common Symbols &amp; Icons

Symbols that include platinum-colored dragon scales or a silhouette of a noble dragon are widely recognized as Icons of Bahamut.Additional symbols can often include anything associated with justice, a silver or platinum-colored shield icon, or occasionally the triangular symbol of Mt. Celestia, where Bahamut resides. Colors trend toward silver and platinum, but blues and purples are common as well.

# Holy Days &amp; Festivals

Bahamut’s name is often invoked during legal proceedings, coronations, and any other important governmental procedures -- but only two days are celebrated as holy. Both of the official holy days for Bahamut are observed on the equinoxes, when the duration of the day and night are equal.

## Day of Rites

Celebrated every year on the spring equinox, this day is filled with trials and rites that are hosted by the church of Bahamut. Most of these contests consist of physical tests that are held in tandem with local governments to recruit guards, but it is not uncommon for there to be rites that include mock legal trials. Many people that hope to start an honorable career will use this day as a chance to prove themselves.

## Day of Appeals

This holiday is generally only observed by people within the church of Honor, and occurs on the Autumn Equinox. On this day, members of the clergy will volunteer to assist local legal systems with whatever they are overburdened with. Generally this means helping with appeals from prisoners and their families, but sometimes Oathsworn and Honorbound members are granted permission to preside over new cases if the local courts are backed up.

# Avatars &amp; Champions

As a deity of Honor, many of Bahamut's followers tend to be classic champion material, and have been appointed to take charge of one of Mt. Celestia’s layers.

## Avatar of Bahamut

Bahamut’s most well-known form is that of a colossal noble dragon covered with platinum scales, but he can also assume the form of a humanoid when necessary. In this humanoid form, he appears as a tall, middle-aged man with broad shoulders, long platinum hair, and impossibly blue eyes. He stands straight, and often wears a blue tabard over a modest set of plate armor.

## Champion:  Ophanim

An angelic creature, Ophanim is one of Bahamut’s most trusted servants. He used to serve as Champion with his sister, Zariel, until she betrayed Celestia and fell during the Blood War. Despite this loss, Ophanim still serves as a loyal messenger and champion for Bahamut.

# Known Sects &amp; Cults

While Honor can sometimes be a constricting Ideal, Bahamut still has broad enough support that the core denomination is often assumed to be the only one. However, there are some secretive and extremist sects as well. Both are outlined below.

## Sect: Order of the Platinum Dragon

The most mainstream sect that follows Bahamut, the Order of the Platinum Dragon works to encourage people in their communities to uphold the values of Honor and Justice. Their ranks are filled with more Paladins than other religious orders.

**Optional Rule: Don’t Lie to Me.** Due to their dedication to Justice and Honor, an Oathsworn or Honorbound have an uncanny ability to detect falsehoods. If an Oathsworn hears a lie, they know that it is a lie. For an Honorbound, if a lie is told in their presence, they know it is a lie and instead hear a relevant truth.

## Sect:  Order of Vengeance

When justice cannot be achieved, the next best thing is often revenge. Members of the Order of Vengeance try to keep a low profile, and work alone or in small groups to provide this service. They are often very secretive, but whispers of them can often be found in poor and marginalized communities, where justice is hardest to find and uphold.

**Optional Rule: Final Retribution.** When an Oathsworn comes face to face with a criminal that escaped justice, they can use an action to make themselves resistant to all damage from that person for an hour. When an Honorbound finds such a person, they can use an action to make themselves immune to all damage from that person for one minute and resistant to damage from  their allies for up to one hour.",1,Honor: Bahamut
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,38,205,"**TL;DR at bottom**  


We all know that in 5e, legendary monsters and BBEG's often get Legendary Actions and Resistances to overcome your party's offensives. While they work, I have always thought of them as slightly boring and a bit meta-gamey. The Legendary Actions I feel are in an alright place, but I dislike Legendary Resistances more. Once your party knows the monster has them, they know to keep casting spells to knock out those Resistances until the monster has no more. It's also lame to hear ""The BBEG fails his saving throw, but he's going to spend on Legendary Resistance to succeed instead"". We also know that in 5e, Action Economy is key to winning a combat encounter. The party will almost always has more actions than the BBEG, and some balance it out by having minions or mooks with the BBEG. While it *works,* is it as entertaining or intense?   


My personal take (that is still in its prototype stages) is **Legendary Turns.**   


I took inspiration from the Level 17 Subclass Feature from Thief Rogue:   
**Thieves' Reflexes:** ""When you reach 17th level, you can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised"".   
While the rogue only gets it for the first turn, I decided to give my BBEG's that feature, *but for every turn.* I took away all or most of their Legendary Actions or Resistances, and gave them additional turns based on how strong they are. This does multiple things: It allows for the BBEG's to still make a good amount of attacks or spells per round, due to multiple attack actions. It allows for good movement to prevent your party from crowding around them. It still allows for decent recovery from spell effects by allowing multiple saves per round instead of just 1. It allows for multiple reactions, for Attacks of Opportunity or Shield/Counterspell (I have the BBEG's reactions come back at the beginning of each of its turn). Overall, I feel it gives the BBEG a better Action Economy to go toe-to-toe with your party without hard to counter inserted actions or saves.   


Now, YMMV. I have a party of 7, so depending on the BBEG or Monster, I may give them 2-3 turns with 0-2 Legendary Actions/Resistances. Here are some examples:  


**The Big Brute:** For the raging barbarian leader I would give 1 Legendary Turn for a total of 2 turns per round, with 1-2 Legendary Actions. This would allow for the Brute to have plenty of opportunists to swing that greataxe between 2 Actions, 2 Reactions, (Maybe) 2 Bonus Actions, and potentially a grapple or charge with their Legendary Actions. I would not give them any Legendary Resistances due to the insane health pool he most likely would have and his low WIS score. The brute would most likely roll high teens or low twenties for initiative, so I would have that second turn at -10 whatever he rolled.  


**The Swift Assassin:** For the quick rogue assassin, I would give them 2 Legendary Turns for a total of 3 turns per round with nothing else. This would allow for plenty of opportunities to relocate themselves with Disengage and find a good spot in which to hide and strike with Sneak Attack. I would not give them the Legendary Actions or Resistances due to the number of turns and amount of saves they would get per round. He's already going to be a pain by relocating a lot and avoiding damage, so landing that Hold Person will feel that much sweeter as your Slashy Minmaxy has his way with the rogue. The rogue would most likely roll mid to high twenties,, so having a -10 and -20 to the additional turns spreads out his turns.   


**The Arcane Asshole:** For your powerful spellcasters I would give them 1 turn with normal Legendary Resistances and Actions. The mage is often not quick or strong, but lets his wits and spells do the work. Giving him multiple opportunists to cast spells when they feel like it, as well as a well train mind to deal with the parties inferior spells. This is the normal rules for BBEG and legendary monsters, so no changes here. I kept this the same because I felt if any creature would have the ability to insert a spell or resist a spell effect with no effort, it would be the all powerful mage.   


**The Massive Monster:** This one depends on the monster. A dragon I would have follow the same rules as **The Big Brute**, but with some Legendary Resistances. A Baba-Yaga I would have them follow **The Swift Assassin**, with 1 Legendary Resistance. A Lich I would have follow **The Arcane Asshole**, with 1 Legendary Turn.  


Once again, YMMV depending on your party. If you have a smaller party, then the traditional rules I feel would work best for you. If you have a larger party, or a highly Min-Max party, then throwing an additional turn or two at them for your boss may throw them off course and make them have to re-evaluate their turns. Do note that giving them additional turns will most likely increase their CR, so account for that.   


Finally, I would like to hear any suggestions of changes or tweaks.   


**TL;DR:** Give your bosses extra turns per encounter instead of Legendary Actions or Resistance if you have a strong party. It may spice up your battles.",1,Legendary Turns - My personal take on BBEG's Legendary Actions and Resistances

25 gallons of water that can be scooped up and moved to wherever needed.  The owner must attune to the water to gain the effect.

Swishing ones hand across the surface of the water grants the ability to Scry on any person, location, place, or time.  This effect lasts for 1 minute.  Unbeknownst to them they are now cursed.

The owner of the water can now Scry upon that person at any time.  The owner can see and hear everything that goes on through the eyes of that person, irregardless of distance or plane.  There is no limit how many can be affected and how many the owner is able to Scry upon.  Any water removed in part will become inert normal water.  12 gallons minimum is required to activate.  Maximum 25 gallons capacity for the effect.  If the amount is reduced below 12 gallons the entire effect is cancelled, all scry's and curses are cancelled.

After 2 weeks, the persons dreams become disturbed.  DC10 INT check or fail to regain 1 spell slot (players choice) after a long rest.  Every 2 weeks the dreams get worse and the loss of slots increases by 1.  i.e. after 4 weeks lose 2 slots.  After 6 weeks lose 3.

A Remove curse or Greater Restoration will remove the effect, all spell slots regained normally on the next long rest.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,50,"Good morning, all.  I recently ran this for my Pathfinder group, and the session went really well.  The players loved it, and I can't stop thinking about it.  So, I thought I'd present it for others.

I like to do up complicated scenarios that use a lot of skills beyond 4Es ""skills challenge"".   One reason combat is so engrossing in DnD is because of the complexity.  You don't just roll for ""combat success"", or roll for damage and see if you can get X damage in Y rounds.  It's a complex moving system with a lot of player choice and interlocking parts before damage is finally allocated.  Combat is also rarely black and white: it's not just ""win"" or ""lose"".  I've been interested in translating that to skills-scenarios, and this is my latest effort.

The heart of the scenario is: once an hour (effectively, an hour becomes a round), a **ship handle** check must be made.  Almost everything else flows into modifies of the ship handle check.  This will allow the players to, at the end of the storm, have either not lost any time, been forced to flee before the storm, or the main ship itself goes under.  Individual DMs will have to work out the implications and consequences of those results (swim to shore?  endurance checks?  offload dinghies and lifeboats? arrive too late for the ceremony / wedding / ambush the bad guy?). 

Scaling: I ran this for 4 level 7 PCs, and gave the ship a total crew of 10.  They were also traveling with an NPC wizard to whom I gave a bucket of spells which were useful in a storm, and gave the PCs control of how to deploy these resources.

**I wouldn't run this with much fewer than 10 crew or the rolls get quite challenging.**  Depending on what you do, math for 10-20 crew seems to be the sweet spot.  If in doubt, I recommend about 15 crew.

# Hurricane Encounter

Hurricane lasts a minimum of 10 hours.  After that, if the wind is at the lowest notch (""Severe"") and is rolled to be lowered, the storm ends.

# Setup

I would get a battlemap or a piece of paper and mark out a bunch of tracks, like a board game: three tracks of three levels for wind, waves and rain.  Three tracks of at least eight levels for the Fatigue / Exhausted increasing characters, and three tracks of eight levels for the Fatigued / Exhausted decreasing characters.

*Each Hour*

**Ship Status**

The ship can have 

* Sailing on course (roughly, no time lost) (no modifier to check)
* Scudding before the wind (lose time for voyage, +5 to ship handle)
* Abreast of the waves (each check ending in abreast of the waves results in **one piece of major damage**, i.e. a sail blows a way or a key rope is smashed by the waves)
* 10 pieces of major damage: ship wreck

**Ship Handle Check**

Roll to for **ship handling**, fail = lose one ship status (i.e. go from sailing on course to scudding before the wind)

* **Ship Handle DC 15 - maintain scudding before the wind**
* **Ship Handle DC 20 - maintain sailing on course**
* **Ship Handle DC 25 - increase status** (i.e. move from abreast of the waves to scudding before the wind)
* **Ship Handle DC 25 -** **maneuver or hold station** (used if someone falls overboard)
* **Modifiers**
   * \+2 for every crew member
   * \+4 for Bosun
   * \+5 for Captain
   * \-5 for each piece of major ship damage
   * (If in rigging) **DC 15 Climb/Acrobatics**: +2 for a PC (if fail by 5 or more, PC falls)
   * (If on deck) **DC 10 Strength**: +1 for a PC

**Ship Zones**

* Rigging
* Deck (option of being **tied in place**)
* Below decks (safe and able to rest and recover fatigue)

**Environment**

Roll for wind strength on d20:

* First 10 hours = hurricane
* Before 24 hours:
   * 1-4 decrease wind strength
   * 15-20 increase wind strength
* After 24 hours:
   * 1-10 decrease wind strength
* Severe wind: no penalty to checks
* Windstorm: -1 to physical checks
* Hurricane: -2 to physical checks
* Roll for rain:
   * 1-5 no rain
   * 6-10 heavy rain -1 all checks, -4 Perception, light by half
   * 11-20 blinding rain -2 all checks, -6 Perception, light to ¼ 
* Roll for waves:
   * 1-10 swells 10’
   * 11-15 swells 20’
   * 16-20 swells 30’

**Characters**

Every hour:

* Fortitude save, DC 10 or become Fatigued (-2 Str Dex) or Exhausted (-6 Str Dex)
   * Increases by 1 each hour
   * \+5 for proper clothing
   * Fatigued reset by 8 hours rest
   * **Crew bonus halved at 8 hours and zero at 16 hours - crew must rest 8 hours below decks, coming on deck resets the rest timer**
   * Proper crew management is one of the player's resources
* Roll for lightning:
   * 18-19 lightning hits ship, **major damage**
   * 20 lightning hits character (crew = 1-7, helmsmen 8-9, Captain 10) 4d8 dmg
      * Helmsmen hit: **Acrobatics / Climb DC 10** **(deck) 15 (rigging)** to stabilize wheel
      * Fail: One piece of **major damage**
* Roll for challenges:
   * 1-2 Grab a crew member as they fall over
      * Acrobatics DC 15
   * 5-9 (only after 10 hours) Morale sinking, crew bonus halved
      * Diplomacy DC 15 to negate
   * 10-12 Stinging squid
      * 24 stinging squid land on the deck, leaping out of the water to avoid a Scaly Needletooth!
      * Run as 24 immobile minions, any contact causes poison damage
      * For every squid still remaining at the end of five rounds, **-1 to ship handle check that hour**
   * 13-14 Deepeye Toadfish
      * 10 Deepeye Toadfish jump on deck
      * Deepeye toadfish are medium sized and have the ability to Swallow Whole medium creatures using their bite attack
      * Can leap 15' in combat over characters
      * Have a one time use acid spit
   * 18-20 (20’) or 10-20 (30’) Struck by wave, all on deck not tied down must save
      * Fortitude or Acrobatics DC 15, or swept overboard

**Ship Damage Table d10:**

It has been a while since I posted anything on my Monster Hunter work, but I promise I have been busy working hard. Originally when I started this as just a Monster Manual for all of the 150+ monsters in the Monster Hunter video game series. After some requests and the positive feedback from my original post I began work on a supplement to D&amp;D 5e so that you are able to bring your players into the world of Monster Hunter.

With that I present [Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z70yXVHKsbLSXMeCMK9bFoOsRiD8Bynf) | [Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCk9FgQaqaXBVmLeCeT). The PDF once downloaded has a clickable table of contents for easy reference while running or playing your game. The GMbinder binder link is the same, with some slight issues on a couple of the weapons in the Table of Contents, but provides easy access while on the go.

*The monster hunter weapons are now included in the guide to monster hunting above, including a new staff for spellcasters.*

# Loot Tables

Within the rule book you will find rules on how to carve or capture creatures to gather materials and using them to create your own custom magical weapons and armor. The Monster Hunter Loot tables are still a work in progress and some editing will be needed even on the onces I have already created. The next part of  my project is to finish up these loot tables in the coming month after all the holiday season finishes up. For now Here is where you can find the [Halfway Completed Monster Hunter Loot Tables PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oUOvUYCoqHlvLqDBLzgggCrngr96aKaV)  |  [Halfway Completed Monster Hunter Loot Tables GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LQ_X0ozlVJgsEGrQYVz).

# Revised Monster Hunter Monster Manual

A lot of changes have happened to the Monster Hunter Monster Manual since I first posted it about 8 months back.  Some of these changes are:

**New Monsters**

* Tempered Lunastra (CR 19)
* Kulve Taroth (CR 21 paragon monster)
* Ahtal-ka and its mechsuit the Ahtal-nesto (both CR 23)
* Behemoth (CR 27)

**Reworks**

* Tzitzi-ya-ku - Less attacks on turn, but given legendary actions.
* Monoblos - Gained the Relentless ability.
* Shogun Ceanataur - Upgraded to a CR 13
* Lavasioth - Gave Legendary Actions
* Valphalk - (revamped) Gave Legendary Actions, bunch of changes all over
* Fatalis -  Upgraded to CR 28

All of these with other minor changes or slight mistakes on other creatures. Currently the new documents do not have a clickable table of contents but that is also a work in progress. With that I present the revised Monster Hunter Monster Manual links below

Below are two excerpts as examples so you can determine if it is worth your time:

&amp;#x200B;

Hunting, Farming, and Gastronomy

Among surface dwellers, it is well established that civilization advances directly in relation to their mastery of fire and farming. Fire allows the growth of industry. Farming allows us to live together and have periods of leisure to develop our society that hunter-gathering does not allow.

Such is not the case for the Tritons, and their society has developed differently as a result. Fire, of course, is nearly completely out (that said, in Minifera there are large pockets within magical bubbles, and all cities have complex cave systems with air in them, allowing some amount of fire; it quickly burns through the oxygen, however, which must be refilled either through magical or technological means; likewise, apparently there are areas undersea in which fire literally vents from the ocean floor—I cannot tell if they are serious about this, but if so, such vents could be where all smelting occurs and why I see it so rarely; it seems impossible that all their metal could be coming via trade).

Farming is likewise difficult, at least in the manner we mean it: it is much more difficult to pen in sea creatures (three dimensional movement, remember), and in addition it seems to go against the ethos of the Tritons to pen in the natural world, as is reflected in many of their idioms: they prefer adaptation to environmental engineering, in general. As a result of this, there are really no domesticated animals. Furthermore, the sea floor in many of their cities received very little sunlight to help plants grow. What they call “farming” is what we might call more of “gardening”—keeping and protecting kelp forests which already exist.

So then, Tritons tend to be hunter-gatherers. Why do I say that they are civilized, not savages, when I would not say this of hunter-gatherer societies on the surface? Quite simply, it is the plenty of the oceans. Hunter-gatherers on the surface often spend most of the daylight simply to provide one day’s food—and as such, language, ethics, and culture never develop. Yet the Tritons are hunter gatherers with an incredibly rich culture. This occurs because there is food everywhere, and they work together easily. They never over-hunt, and they work together easily as a group. Their typical hunting pattern is to find a school of fish and begin to swim in large circles around them, while one (the “netman” remains far below). Slowly, all three will close in bit by bit (“tightening the net” they call it)—each circle gets a foot tighter, then a foot tighter, and so on, while the netman slowly comes from the bottom. The fish’s instincts cause the school to congregate closer and closer to the center, until eventually the netman can cast and bring in the entire school. A party of ten Tritons can easily find enough food in a single net-tightening to feed them for days.

(I have also found that the Tritons can apparently command the fish to simply come to them!—either magically, or through years of adapted body language. However, this is seen as a last resort and a bit shameful—a “proper hunt” is the preferred method.)

Kelp and plants are also harvested. It seems that Tritons are just as susceptible to poisoning by undercooked food as we are; however, they have developed an ingenious method of using various algaes and seaweeds to “cook” their food without a fire. These are apparently highly acidic and, with proper wrapping and treatment, the seafood is rendered safe to eat. In the coastal villages near Minifera, this technique has been picked up by a few local restaurants, which they are calling ceviche. The surface chefs use lemons and limes to achieve the same result, and the citrusy flavors (totally exotic and unknown to the Tritons) have become quite popular in Minifera. A significant amount of Triton trade along the coastline is now for sealed barrels of lemon and lime juice, to add more flavoring to their undersea diets.

Neither alcohol nor tobacco are used by Tritons underwater, and their bodies are not at all used to their consumption. This has led to more than one incident when Tritons travel to the Surface, and Tritons should be served alcohol only in moderation and with caution—for your good as well as theirs.

I ran a 5+ hour session on this monster a while back and now I am eager to share my campaign notes with Y'all. The whole session was a huge, HUGE hit at our table and I directly owe a lot of my success to all the brave redditors who went before me who shared their personal notes here on Reddit as well. As such I would like to give back to the community by sharing my personal compiled 8-page document of notes on how to run and prepare for a False Hydra session.

The notes are a little bit of an amalgamation between my real pre-session notes and my after session notes but I think it still holds up. There should be something in there for everyone to use. For ease of reading the document is broken up into 5 different sections:

1. The Set-up
2. The Introduction
3. The Arrival
4. The Horror (3 pages full of all the weird stuff that could happen to your players)
5. The End? (including the stat block of a 'Young False Hydra' at the end)

I was not convinced in my own abilities to pull off something [as hard as the death of a secret party member](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7ixd0s/my_proudest_dm_moment_the_death_of_a_secret_party/) so I went with something a little bit more pragmatic in the beginning. I hope you enjoy it and find it useful!

Good luck to all future DMs running their own False Hydra story arcs! I look forward to hear all about your future False Hydra stories :D

Team Ico have created 3 of my favorite games.

* **Ico**, an amazing dungeon crawl where you feel next to helpless the entire time, with a big-bag made of shadow and electricity. 
* **Shadow of the Colossus**, the most epic adventure to come to the gaming scene. Change my mind.
* And **The Last Guardian**, a mix of the two, combining dungeon crawl ideals with this epic nature, filled with drama and excitement.

Here are the things those games taught me about worldbuiling...

1. Theme IS the World
---
* I've touched on this idea of Theme a lot, but these games really drive it home to the point of you playing INSIDE the theme.
* In Ico, you have someone (a key, essentially) strapped to your side that you must carry with you and protect from the evil shadow creatures.
* In SotC, your goal is the resurrection of a lover or a friend and to accomplish this, you are put against colossal creatures which represent the impossible nature of your task.
* In Guardian, you're put into an environment that you CAN'T navigate on your own. You have to trust and communicate with this beast in order to escape.
* Think about the themes you believe. How do you look at the world? Then personify that into something tangible that affects the gaming world.
* As an example - if this War Campaign that we've been talking about had a theme of togetherness, we could personify that by adding in these neighboring factions that can be won over. These things can ONLY be affected by the party. 
* Or, if the theme is that War is Hell, we let the party know that there is no victory here. Things become more abstract. There's never a winner or a front runner. Just death. Lots of fighting and death with no outcome.

2. Be Not Afraid
---
* Team Ico is not afraid of adding things into the party. You have no control over these thing. You merely interact with them, or communicate with them.
* These things add to the world and to the game-play, allowing you to do more than you would normally do, but also giving you more responsibility.
* Give your party something, or multiple somethings, that YOU control. You control them and use them as a communication between yourself and the party. 
* Continuing the war example - the party receives a TANK with a pilot that will listen to the party and is tasked with aiding them on their mission
* This would allow you to throw monumentous tasks at the party and force them into interesting situation that they have to be creative to get out of. 
* A more personal example - I started a campaign where each of the 3 party members was given a wyrmling dragon. This meant that combats would be easy, normally. But instead I was able to create epic conflict, where WAY TOO MANY enemies were coming at the party at once. Or more powerful enemies would be placed in the way.

3. Making the Players Feel Badass
---
* Nothing is better in all of gaming than the moment you take down a colossus. 
* What things in your world will make your players feel that same feeling? 
* Even in the lowest of fantasy setting, or the standardest DnD settings, giving the players the ability to feel powerful and epic is important. 
* Bake some of these things into your world. They don't have to be giant creatures. 
* In Ico, this epic thing is when you get this mighty sword which can slay the shadow creatures. 
* In the Last Guardian, these moments come whenever you are outnumbered by animated armor and Trico comes to crush them.
* In this war campaign - maybe these moments are baked in when you accomplish some big task. Gaining rank, maybe.
* Bake in moments of awesome into your campaign to let you PCs feel immense and powerful. Maybe even just useful.

4. Story Matters
---
* A lot of people in the DnD-sphere have a big problem with pre-written adventures. Sandboxes are the ""best way to play"". 
* I agree. I'm one of those people. 
* BUT, story is also very important. And I think the intersection of these two things, Sandbox and Story, comes from background.
* I had this same idea in the Cowboy Bebop post. But USE PLAYER'S BACKSTORIES. If they don't bring you one, then you add onto it.
* Pull from your theme. Make this into a story that your player's backstories can react to. 
* I say this because it was these games that really showed me how the story can make you *feel* a certain way.
* If the Last Guardian was a campaign, it would be a dungeon crawl. The dungeon is there with its own story, the players are there for their own reason, and the DM would be Trico adding in this connection. 
* It's the intersection of ALL THREE THINGS that creates the amazing experience.
* THE WORLD + THE PLAYERS + THE DM creates the story. And the more you personify each of those things, the more impactful it will be.

5. Conclusion
---
* DMs - give yourself ways to be IN the story, characters, or creatures, or pets, or familiars (or tanks...).
* Create your world to show your thematic choices, no matter what they are. 
* Put Awesome Things (tm) in that world, for the players to fuck around with.
* Use your players backstories and tie them into this theme and this world.

This is the fourth in a series of articles. I hope you get something out of it. At this point I think I've covered some of my biggest ideas behind worldbuilding and might dip into some other ideas from other shows/games/movies/whatever. 

In other news, I have an AMA on Friday. That's exciting. I'll be releasing my first book at that time. It's an adventure. I'll be answering questions that have to do with that and anything else. Plus, i'll be doing something a little special. So I hope to see you there. ",1,"What I learned: Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian"

# The Guardian

There are Druids who establish themselves as the guardians of a particular place - the habitat of an endangered species, a stand of ancient trees, the lair of a dryad, a tomb, a garden, or a ruined tower. Often the Druid watches over a [Sacred Grove](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6e77hq/places_of_power_the_druids_grove/). These often have location-specific magical powers that others try to exploit for selfish or evil purposes. 

Sometimes the Guardians protect artifacts or magic items that were deemed safer locked away, or held against future need. Sometimes the things a Guardian protects may seem small, but they are important to the Druid's notion of Balance. A mountaintop might serve as the nesting place of a rare breed of hawks prized by nobles as hunting falcons, forcing the Druid to continually guard against those who want to steal the chicks or eggs - without enough falcons, the entire ecosystem is thrown out of balance.

A Guardian usually lives deep in the wilderness, away from humanity. Like most Guardians, they normally feel wary of strangers, suspecting that they come to exploit or threaten the site they defend. They will be loathe to speak except to warn visitors away, or perhaps not even bother with that, and drive them off with magic! Many a rumored-to-be-haunted place may have just been the protected domain of a Guardian Druid. 

In any case, visitors will be met with short shrift and not be allowed to remain in the area except under extreme need (like someone bleeding out, or some other threat-to-life). The Guardian will not speak about what they guard, simply claiming that the area is their home, and it must be defended against all outsiders, as per an ancient Compact (this is part of the Oath a Druid recites when joining the Order). 

Violence will be met with violence and curiosity with silence. A Guardian has allies, but no friends, and will not give trust to anyone they don't get to know over many many years. Even animals may be suspect, if they wander into a Guardian's territory and are not familiar. 

Those, however, who approach a Guardian with true and honest need will find a friend indeed. The Guardian gets to roll Insight checks with Advantage and can add their proficiency to the roll. A favorable roll will melt the gruff from a Guardian, but will not win their friendship - that takes time and patience. In any case, the Guardian will seem eccentric and shy around others, acts of kindness will be left to find, never directly given (like food or other treats left near campsites). 

There are Guardians who, when witnessing tragedy, sometimes change, radically. If an animal species is hunted to extinction or near-extinction within their territory, or if a plant species is eradicated, the Guardian may grow angry, and become obsessed with punishing the victims. This translates into the Guardian sometimes gathering monsters to protect the area, or setting deadly traps for future incursions, or some other strong act of defense. Sometimes, though, this causes the Guardian to change and become an [Avenger Druid](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a4x6p7/druids_conclave_avenger/) or even a Lost Druid if the territory is destroyed. 

A Guardian may act as the protector of several places in a lifetime, if the Order deems it necessary. Sacred Groves are often overseen by a rotating roster of Guardians, and doing a ""tour of duty"" throughout Druid-controlled lands is common. It is primarily the older druids who become permanent stewards, and some of them have refused to give up their charge, even when ordered by the Grand Druid. A Guardian's vow is strong, and sometimes this vow transcends death. Druid shades can be found in ancient places and sometimes these Guardians go mad. 

Guardians may become Wandering Druids if some reason compels them to do so. If this occurs, the Guardian will feel compelled to find another to take their place in the territory. This is most often a younger (lower level) Druid, who is known to the Guardian, but in rare cases an older (higher level) Druid will agree to the task, knowing that it may be the last stewardship of their lives. 

Guardians who are demi-human are the most common, as their extended life span translates well to prolonged periods of guardianship. Humans that becomes Guardians are most often zealots, who have made hasty vows in the heat of some trauma and now are compelled by stubbornness to see it through. This often makes them bitter and they lead miserable lives. The few that spoke their vows in truth still feel the firey righteousness of it, but they have matured into an understanding with themselves that what they are doing is important, beyond passionate rhetoric, and these Guardians are the very few who will brag about what they protect, and why. 

Guardians come in many combat flavors, each suited to their needs when it comes to what exactly they are protecting. Naturally, they tend towards powerful magic when guarding Important Things. For this reason, each Guardian's spell packages will depend on their role, and writing a list of them would just be the entire list in the PHB, with the relevant bits picked out. A Guardian of the Last Orchid would probably not have Fire spells, but a Guardian of the True Crown might. For this reason, I have left that section out of this archetype. 



# NPC Examples

* **Jalel Yishin**: This Elven Guardian protects an artefact sealed in a ""Millenium Vault"" (an Elven creation that can only be opened once every thousand years), and is the latest in a long line of Guardians of this site. The Druid will do her best to drive off trespassers or robbers on her own, but she has a magic item that allows her to contact, and teleport, a ""strike team"" of other Druids to her location if necessary. She (and any reinforcements) will fight to the death to protect the Vault, such is the nature of the power contained within. If questioned, she will expound on the history of the site and the need for the artefact to remain contained, but cannot be persuaded to give up her charge.

* **Hanshaw Grey**: This Human Guardian dwells in a cave on the edge of a vast and ancient battlefield. The conflagration took the lives of thousands, and the resulting trauma has created a minor area of necrotic energy which periodically spawns undead in the battlefield. The Druid patrols the area rigorously and puts down all the abominations that rise. The Guardian will warn off any who get too close, and will do so strongly, but if the trespassers are determined, he will allow them passage. His greatest fear is to die here and rise as undead.

* **Timberlaine**: This Pixie Guardian claims the territory of a dead dragon's bones as its charge. Through a typically-unpredictable-series-of-Fey-pranks, the Pixie is directly responsible for the death of the drake, and in its sorrow, took its vow to protect the dragon's hoard and remains. Timberlaine uses all its tricks and spells to create the illusion that the area is haunted, driving off the curious and resorting to stronger methods in the face of prepared tomb-robbers. Timberlaine would gladly give up its charge if the hoard could be transferred to one of the dragon's relatives and its bones properly interred and blessed. 


# Plot Hooks

* The party crosses into the territory of a Guardian and is suddenly under constant and covert attacks that seem like the party is being opposed by many enemies, but it is only a single Druid. The Druid will not speak or negotiate and will be very difficult to locate without magic. If pressed, the Druid will explain that the area they are trespassing in is proscribed by ancient law to remain free of any humanoids save a single protector.
* The party is contacted by an old Druid ally who says they have taken up the mantle of a Guardian and asks them to visit when they can. Upon visiting, the party discovers their friend has been slain and the thing they were protecting is gone/destroyed/other. 
* A band of 5 Guardian Druids have closed the main road through a forest, and have stopped all trade and traffic. When asked for an explanation, the Guardians claim that the area was part of a unicorn's domain and now the Fey creature has been slain (they do not know by whom). When powerful Fey die, their spirits linger and sometimes can cause magical oddities to occur. The Guardians say this closure will be temporary (only 100 years!) but they cannot allow anyone to be exposed to the danger. 
* A dungeon that the party has arrived at is under the Guardianship of an awakened Elk, who was inducted into the Druidic Order, and has taken it upon itself to ensure that the dungeon remains sealed. The Guardian cannot say why, as its under the influence of a Geas (cast by the Grand Druid themselves), and begs the party to turn back. If they insist, the Guardian expresses regret and will fight to the death. If the dungeon is opened, something truly horrible is released.
* A sleeping Guardian is resting in front of a [Gate](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/39a47k/gates/), and appears unable to wake. In reality, the Guardian's body is now dead and it exists as an incorporeal spirit, with the same powers it had in life. It will not let the Gate be opened unless extreme need and a convincing argument can make it stand down.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,55,513,"You know what’s a blast? That first time you get to launch that orb of angry fire at a horde of kobolds and laugh maniacally at the face your GM makes when he informs you that they are all dead.

The Fireball, one of the greatest spells ever crafted to ensure that people were going to have a bad day on the Material Plane. But just how did it get its start? And how has it changed through the many editions of DnD? In AD&amp;D, the Fireball is a 3rd level spell that can pack a huge punch at later levels. . . not so much when you first get it though, plus you never wanted to cast it when there was treasure to be found. 

The history of the fireball in tabletop gaming reaches back to 1970, where the first incarnation can be found in a war game created by Leonard Patt. We aren’t going to get into the debate about how Gygax stole the fireball, and many many other things, from Patt’s game. My opinion is that tabletop gaming was, and still is, like Linux.  People were provided with a base operating system, use what they need, create what they want and it just keeps growing and getting better.

With the advent of D&amp;D and its complex set of rules, the fireball was “born” within the context of gameplay. Magic Users were typically very weak early level characters in OD&amp;D (A d4 hit points per level will do that to you). Mostly seen as a support class, magic users stood in the back, had some basic buff spells and spells more tailored towards role playing outside of combat. The only attack spell of any consequence was the magic missile (1d6+1). In OD&amp;D, at 5th level, the magic user starts his/her transition into an offensive character, and it begins with the fireball.  

&gt; D&amp;D (First Edition) Fireball
&gt;
&gt; Spell Level 3
&gt;
&gt; Duration 1 turn
&gt;
&gt; Range 24""
&gt;
&gt; Explanation/Description: A missile which springs from the finger of the Magic-User. It explodes with a burst radius of 2"". In a confined space the Fire Ball will generally conform to the shape of the space (elongate or whatever). The damage caused by the missile will be in proportion to the level of its user. A 6th level Magic-User throws a 6-die missile, a 7th a 7-die missile, and so on. (Note that Fire Balls from Scrolls (see Volume II) and Wand are 6-die missiles and those from Staves are 8-die missiles. Duration: 1 turn. Range: 24"" [OD&amp;D Vol-1, p. 25]

At first glance the range of the fireball looks ridiculous. 24” would have you casting a fireball that could travel a maximum of 2 feet. Suicide by fireball seems like a pretty painful way to go. Distance is clarified in the PHB as  1” equaling 10 feet indoors and 10 yards outdoors. AOE is always calculated using indoor distance. So we go from what looks like a real small distance to an incredibly large distance. Being able to cast a fireball the length of two football fields when you are outdoors is quite extreme. I don’t see many opportunities to cast a fireball 240 ft indoors, but the wizard has the ability to do so if needed.  A 20 ft radius has not changed since this original version.  

&gt; AD&amp;D Fireball
&gt;
&gt; Range: 100 feet+1 foot per level
&gt;
&gt; Duration: Instantaneous
&gt;
&gt; AOE: 20 foot radius sphere
&gt;
&gt; Components: V,S (Sulphur &amp; Guano)
&gt;
&gt; Casting time:  3 segments
&gt;
&gt; Saving Throw : 1/2
&gt;
&gt; Explanation/Description: A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar, and delivers damage proportionate to the level of the magic-user who cast it, i.e. 1 six-sided die (d6) for each level of experience of the spell caster. Exception: Magic fireball wands deliver 6 die fireballs (6d6), magic staves with this capability deliver 8 die fireballs, and scroll spells of this type deliver a fireball of from 5 to 10 dice (d6 + 4) of damage. The burst of the fireball does not expend a considerable amount of pressure, and the burst will generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume. [The area which is covered by the fireball is a total volume of roughly 33,000 cubic feet (or yards)]. Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball will melt soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Items exposed to the spell's effects must be rolled for to determine if they are affected. Items with a creature which makes its saving throw are considered as unaffected. The magic-user points his or her finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body prior to attaining the prescribed range, flowers into the fireball. If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point damage from the blast. Those who make saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat or roll aside, taking ½ the full hit point damage - each and every one within the blast area. The material component of this spell is a tiny ball composed of bat guano and sulphur. [1E PHB, p. 73]
&gt;
&gt; For clarification purposes, distance is calculated based on indoor ranges.  

Now things get exciting. In AD&amp;D, the fireball is the first “big” damage spell the magic user gets. Prior to the fireball, the only spells that cause any decent damage are the magic missile (d4+1 per level, at 5th level the magic user gets 2 missiles, for a possible max damage of 12 hp) and shocking grasp (1d8+1 per level, at 5th level max possible damage of 13 hp). Fireball at 5th level has a maximum of 20 damage. Not the biggest jump in damage output at 3rd level, but with one additional d6 damage per level, it grows in strength pretty quickly.

AD&amp;D fireball came with some serious drawbacks. We get a big “Fuck You” as now all coins and a wide variety of magic items have to make a save or else be destroyed in some fashion, which is a major headache for not just the players, but also the GM. Do you roll one save for all the items?  Or is it one save for each type of items that was in the room, ie. a save for all coins, a save for potions, a save for scrolls, etc? And that’s not to mention that I can’t think of anything that a player hates more than seeing their treasure destroyed. To make matters even worse, the fireball now will “generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume”. Casting a fireball now became very hazardous to everyone’s health when cast in a dungeon. A fireball cast in a small corridor will cause blowback and would probably hit the front line PC’s if they are engaged in battle. If I’m the front line fighter, at 5th level I would have a maximum of 50 hp.  So if one of my own party members hit me for almost 1/2 of my hp, I’d be pretty pissed. Not only do you have the chance of causing some pretty good damage to your party members, but you’ll melt all the coin and burn up all those scrolls you’ve been looking for. To top it all off, there is a lot of math when it comes to cubic feet and room dimensions, and everyone knows that D&amp;D is better when you add in huge amounts of math.

*EDIT: 2e Fireball is basically a copy and paste of the 1e Fireball except it puts a cap on the Fireball damage to 10d6 damage. Sorry for the confusion!*

&gt; 3e Fireball
&gt;
&gt; Evocation [Fire]
&gt;
&gt; Level: Sor/Wiz 3
&gt;
&gt; Components: V, S, M
&gt;
&gt; Casting Time: 1 action
&gt;
&gt; Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
&gt;
&gt; Area: 20-ft.-radius spread
&gt;
&gt; Duration: Instantaneous
&gt;
&gt; Saving Throw: Reflex half
&gt;
&gt; Spell Resistance: Yes
&gt;
&gt; A fireball spell is a burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. 
&gt;
&gt; The character determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the character and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point (an early impact results in an early detonation). If the character attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, the character must ""hit"" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
&gt;
&gt; The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does. [3E SRD]

3rd Edition fireball finds itself as a great way of dishing out some damage, with the same “Fuck You” trap that it had in the earlier edition with low melting point metals melting away. At this point, I’m pretty sure that Gygax and Co. just don’t like fun. Especially when you realize that this casting of the spell caps out at 10d6 where as the older versions didn’t have a cap on power. 

Range scaling stays the same -  100'+10'/level underground, and then multiplying that by a factor of 4. While we assumed this would get nerfed, the fireball kept its massive range of the spell. There is also clarification on what happens if there’s a chance the fireball would hit something on the way to its intended target. A ranged touch attack must now be made. Definitions from the 3e PHB are as follows.

Ranged touch attack: A touch attack made at range, as opposed to a melee touch attack. See touch attack.
Touch attack: An attack in which the attacker must connect with an opponent, but does not need to penetrate armor. Touch attacks may be either melee or ranged. The target’s armor bonus, shield bonus, and natural armor bonus (including any enhancement bonuses to those values) do not apply to AC against a touch attack.

How one would determine the AC of an arrow slit, I’m not quite sure.  The spell specifically states that the player must “hit the opening”, not the intended target behind the arrow slit. So, the GM will need to figure out what the AC is of the arrow slit and on a successful attack roll, the player’s fireball would pass through the slit and hit that poor kobold. 

Now let’s say that kobold is standing in a small 10X10 room.  Does that mean the effects of the fireball will shoot out of the arrow slit?  It sure will, curling out the arrow slit along the wall and into the room for an additional 10 feet in all direction.  So once again, we hope no one is standing too close to the arrow slit.  

&gt; 4e Fireball
&gt;
&gt; Wizard Attack 5 
&gt;
&gt; A globe of orange flame coalesces in your hand. You hurl it at your enemies, and it explodes on impact. Daily ✦ Arcane, Fire, Implement 
&gt;
&gt; Standard Action 
&gt;
&gt; Area burst 3 within 20 squares 
&gt;
&gt; Target: Each creature in burst 
&gt;
&gt; Attack: Intelligence vs. Reflex 
&gt;
&gt; Hit: 3d6 + Intelligence modifier fire damage. 
&gt;
&gt; Miss: Half damage.  

Whew… That’s a lot of new words and not much to go off of. We are going to start right below the brief description with Daily. In this edition of DnD, there are spells you can cast once per day, Fireball being one of those. That’s pretty easy, now let’s jump into something a little more complex, like Burst! 

But first: 4e is a different style of DnD that many people talk down on, I am not one of those people. 4e has a unique style that really lets players feel like super bad-ass heroes, and one of the ways it does that is by describing everything as if you are on a battle mat with a 1” square grid. 

Burst is a new mechanic in DnD, but it’s actually not. All Burst means is that when the spell goes off, the point of origin square plus the surrounding squares on all sides of the origin square will be affected, this is up to a certain number(like 3). Following Burst is “within 20 squares” which just tells you how far away you can cast the spell away from you. So when a spell says: Burst 3 within 20; the spell’s area of effect is 7 squares(35’) by 7 squares, and you can cast it up to 100’ away from you. 

The rest of the fireball descriptor is pretty self explanatory and there isn’t much left to talk about except for that damage. And boy, that 3d6 + Int Mod is pretty lacking when it comes to damage, especially for a daily spell. At least they didn’t rub salt in the wound and make all that gold melt away.

&gt; 5e Fireball
&gt;
&gt; Casting Time: 1 action
&gt;
&gt; Range: 150 feet
&gt;
&gt; Components: V S M (A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
&gt;
&gt; Duration: Instantaneous
&gt;
&gt; Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard
&gt;
&gt; A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
&gt;
&gt; The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
&gt;
&gt; At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

There’s lots of talk about the fireball in 5e out there on the web. One of the best articles in my option on the fireball can be found at D&amp;D beyond. Yes, the fireball is overpowered, but it is done so on purpose.  It is the most iconic spell in D&amp;D and has always been overpowered in some fashion, either in damage or distance. But that’s what makes the fireball.

I am not going to begrudge the wizard the fireball and its massive damage. The poor wizard has been hiding in the background until this point, buffing the other heroes and casting their magic missile. Now at 5th level, they have this spell that can immediately turn the tide the a battle. 

It should also be noted that it specifically stated that all flammable objects laying around will burn. So let’s hope those spell scrolls aren’t in plain sight, or the wizard just screwed himself over.

**The Space:** 

This 20 ft wide 15 ft tall tunnel has small Stone tubes protruding from every surface. Some tubes are as small as your finger, others are as large as your head.

The tubes hiss slightly with the sound of gas and almost immediately afterwards a gout of flame consumes the gas.

The shape of the tunnel is either a downward spiral, or several ""S"" bends (DM discretion).

**Effects:**

* **Belching flames** to move more than 10 ft through this space requires a DC 8 intelligence check; for each 5 ft beyond the first 10ft add +1 to the total DC. On a failure take (1d4) fire damage for each number below the total DC up to a max of (3d4)

* *Proficiency in acrobatics can be added to the Roll*

* *Characters can perform the Help action as normal*

* *Moving only 10ft per round is safe and forces no rolls.*


* **Fire Beetle nest:** This room is a nesting Ground for fire Beetles and Giant fire beetles.

* *A character can perform a DC 12 Wisdom (Nature) check to identify the tubes as Fire Beetle burrows, and also all of the following information.*

* *after a gout of flame a concussive impact (hard blow) to the tube may bring the beetle to the entrance to investigate.*

* *the gland inside a fire beetle of sufficient size (giant fire beetle) can provide illumination or several days if carefully harvested from its corpse*


* The room brightly lit


**Encounter:**

**A hot meal**
----

**Type:** Combat or social 


**Challenge:** Ogre, Terrain 


**Opening:**


As you creep carefully down the flaming tunnel you see ahead of you a large humanoid figure, taking up much of the tunnel, because of its size it is clearly of giant kin but definitely a lesser member of its ilk.


The creature is naked save for a shoddily made loin cloth and its skin is covered with burns, some fresh, others scared over. It eagerly moves from one tube of fire to the next as they ignite, giving them a hard slap then grabbing the small insect that comes out and shove the beetle into its mouth.


**Notes:** 


The Oger wants an easy meal and perhaps one with fewer burns.

The ogre does not want to share  either the beetles, or the tunnel.

in combat the Ogre will probably fail the Intelligence check to avoid burns

I'd reflavor the javelin in the stat block to be the longer Beetle tubes and deal bludgeoning damage instead.

**Warning** the Ogre can one hit **kill** some PC's  below level 2, and with a critical , below level 3. That combined with the fact they can be taking chip damage every turn makes this more deadly than it appears.

For higher levels add more ogres or half-ogres. Make it a family group, remember they obey the largest (even if that is also the dumbest).

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,55,"(Really) long story short, my players got taken to the Feywild and were abducted by Maeve, the Winter Lady and brought to the Winter Carnival, full of horrible delights, rigged games, and cursed prizes. My players absolutely loved ""Bumper Cars"" ride, which turned out to be a life-sized pinball machine, and two of them insisted that I post it here. Obviously, the flavor text can be modified to be anything you like, but they loved the mechanics of it. I wish I had more time to write more into it. 

**Bumper Cars**

There is a single car with two seats in it. One is obviously a driver with a steering while, and one has two big red buttons on it (they look like the toggles in a pinball machine). They get in, and the wall closes behind them. A bright red button appears on the wall that says “PUSH!” A player outside the game must push the button. 

Their car is hit hard from behind and they go flying forward into a huge arena where bright flashing lights and loud noises start to activate and come to life. Far above, bright letters flash in the sky that read “Winter Night!” At the edges of the arena it is a brightly lit winter night, snow is falling on bare trees and the moon glows huge. The path they are on takes a sharp turn to the left and then suddenly drops them onto a ramped plane. Behind them, they catch a brief glance of a huge, flashing light that says “3
TICKETS!” over a large hole in the wall before they slide into a pillar and are ricocheted away.

The game works as follows: The Flipper controller determines where in the game they go, and the Driver determines what happens when they get there. To avoid it being boring and repetitive, I just closed the ""gaps"" in the D20 rolls to determine what happened next if they roll something they previously completed.

Toggle D20:

*1-2 They utterly miss it and they fall through. Any tickets acquired are lost and a ""whomp whomp"" noise plays.
 
*3-5 They are sent flying into a ramp in the upper left hand corner. They almost hit a wall when it falls away and the bumper car slides almost to a stop. They are in a small room with ice on the floor. The walls are pained like a deep forest. To the left is a frost giant painted on the wall, to the right is a frost dragon, but in the middle is a warm looking lodge with smoke coming out of it (still painted on).

◦ 6-9 – They are sent flying to the upper right corner where there are a series of bumpers
that look like trees with angry faces on them. The trees start swatting at them and they
are bounced between them. 

◦ 10-13 – They are launched upwards towards three side by side pictures of stunningly
beautiful people, side by side. One is a man wearing a long red scarf and wielding a
golden spear and shield, another is a teenage girl with a flower crown around her head
and an earthy brown flowy dress with birds flying around her, and the middle one is a
terrifying looking woman with firey red hair and bright orange eyes wearing full plate
mail armor. 

◦ 14-17 – They are lauched up and almost reach the ticket, but fall back towards the
flipper. Roll again with advantage.

◦ 18-20 – They fly right into the top of the arena and are awarded 3 tickets.

**The Winter Lodge**
  Driver rolls a D20.
*1-6 The drift to the left and they take 1d10 bludgeoning damage as the giant's club swings out of the wall at them, ricocheting them back into the arena. 
*7-12 to the right and take 2d6 cold damage and are blasted back into the arena. 
*13-20 they slide slowly towards the cabin. The door opens and a mechanical looking ancient hag reaches out, hands them a ticket and thanks them for coming to visit her, and they are jerked backwards into the arena.

**The Bumper Forest**
 Driver rolls a D20
*1-6 – They take 1d10 damage as the trees club them hard, tossing them back into the arena. 
*7-12 – They get out without damage, but are falling right towards the middle. Flipper roll with
disadvantage.
*13-20 – They hit each tree one by one, swerving around branches, until the last tree is hit and they all freeze. The last one has a hole in the side with a ticket in it. They to reach it somehow as they fall away. 

**The Summer Court**
 Driver roll D20
*1-6 – Hit the Summer Knight. A voice says “Oh, you got the summer knight! Careful, he's got a temper!” A bright red light appears above them and the next time they roll below a 10, they're hit for 1d6 piercing damage.
*7-12 – They hit the Summer Lady. “Why would you do that? Everyone loves the Summer Lady! I think the very earth itself may take umbrige with that!” The next roll is with disadvantage.
*13-20 – Titantia. They immediately take 2d6 fire damage. “Hahahahahahaha! Oh my god you seriously just hit Titania! That's just a picture of her and she's still going to make you pay for that. Oh my god, that's hilarious!” Titania will remember that. 
If they hit all three of them, they get another ticket.

# Beastfriend

There are some people who are just naturally attractive to animals, and who feel a kinship, in return. These folks sometimes become Druids, and when they do, they become a powerful and interesting member of the way of Balance. 

Beastfriends do not have servants, or slaves, they have what their title implies - friends, who do the Druid favors because of a mutally respectful relationship. Animals are incapable of lying (deception for survival is another matter), and so the Druids who are drawn to this lifestyle begin to prefer the company of animals over the constant games of deceit practiced by the humanoid races of civilization. 

These Druids are drawn to animals of all kinds, wild or domestic, and they feel their suffering keenly. Beastfriends will not abide abuse, exploitation, or incarceration of any animal, if it is in their power to change. Sometimes these freed animals are the subject of an *Awaken* spell by powerful Beastfriends (who also do this to their animal friends/companions), and are granted boons from the Druid, to aid them in their new lives.  

Zoos, animal shows, animal racing, animal fighting, or the like will immediately be marked for change by a Beastfriend, if they can find a way to do so safely for the animals involved. A Druid isn't going to release a Polar Bear into a desert environment, for example, so planning and the aid of allies is often required for activities like this. In any case, they will take the war to the animal oppressors, and they are often without mercy in dealing with them. If the animals have been mistreated as well as captive, a powerful Beastfriend will sometimes forcibly shapechange the offender and have the animals it once harmed decide its final fate. 

Beastfriends rely on allies insomuch as they provide a means to their ends, and they will interact with them as little as possible, trusting to their animal allies to watch their backs. They will ally with other Druids over any other factions, if possible, but their philosophies sometimes clash with the other tenets of Balance, and they keep these alliances as temporary as possible. 

Beastfriends believe that animals are a more pure form of existence, and preferable to their current one, and that if the humanoids were reduced in number (somewhere between 0 and 1), then Nature could find parity on its own, and the Druids themselves would no longer be necessary. Quite a radical idea among such an ancient tradition!

Beastfriends stay Wildshaped as long as they possibly can, and pine for it when forced to return to their natural forms. They will often change species as the seasons turn, or when a mission is required. They speak the language of animals fluently, and their ideas are quite different to the traditional belief that a Druid should take a ""long view"" of Nature and the world - to formulate plans that take decades or centuries to unfold. To a Beastfriend, life is now - they are devout disciples of living with mindfulness - an animal's existence is unpredictable and the Beastfriend believes that someone with compassion should act *now*, and not in a hundred years! Not when it comes to freeing animals from the wretched servitude of humanoids. 

Beastfriends have a great affinity with *therianthropes*, that is shape-changers like lycanthropes and ursinethropes, and can spot them with a simple Nature check (DC 8). Some Druids make the transition and become therianthropes themselves, although this is frowned upon by the Druidic order, as the affliction is a full-blown curse, and Beastfriends who do this are often shunned or even hunted down by other Druids. 

Beastfriends are sometimes former herdsmen, grooms, hunters, or other professions that deal with animals, and they have undergone some change or understanding that causes them to change their priorities and champion the creatures they once oppressed.


# Mechanics

Beastfriends double their proficiency when using the Animal Handle skill, or when using Nature to obtain lore on natural creatures, and can automatically succeed on Handle checks with domesticated animals, unless the animal is under severe stress/trauma. If the creature is wild, but non-hostile, the check can also be automatic if the DM desires. This applies to any normal animal, even if magically enlarged or giant-by-birth (dire creatures and the like). 

Hostile wild creatures, and domestic animals trained to fight increase the DC needed by up to 10, depending on the situation. 

Beastfriends speak languages common to all beasts, birds, and reptiles. Fish and insects are not able to be communicated with.

# NPC Examples

* **Illis Trench**: This Human Druid was once a son of a shepherd until he felt the Call. He travels with a pair of herding dogs (Frick and Frack) and a small herd of sheep. Trench has learned as much farm medicine as he can and serves as vet and ally to the many rural folk that he meets on his travels. Forced to confront cruelty, the Beastfriend becomes a dangerous foe, and the dogs can attack as well as herd, and are well-versed in tactics. 

* **Wulu Vespers**: This Elven Beastfriend is a loner who dwells in the deep desert with a huge colony of desert vipers and lizards. More madman than sage, he will entreat visitors to sit among his friends and not to fear. Those that run are attacked and killed, but those who accept his hospitality are unharmed. He babbles nonsense mostly, and likes to send visitors off into the worst parts of the wasteland, in the hope of being undisturbed again. Wulu has lost his taste for humanoids, and rarely speaks at all except to shake a large rattle that he carries at all times, and it serves as his divine focus as well as his tool for speaking to the snakes. 

* **Grenna Hunchtower**: This Gnomish Beastfriend is old and kindly, and lives in the alleyways of the city. She is friend to the stray and the exiled and has amassed a huge pack of dogs and cats who follow her like a queen and protect her as only they can. She has a reputation as a ""crazy old street lady"", but those who have treated her with kindness and talked with her have found a wise and thoughtful being who understands that her place in Nature is to shepherd what she can and let Nature's hunger take the rest, as is it's due. Grenna has allies among the vermin world, if needed, and can marshal an army in the thousands. She hates horse-owners and will go out of her way to free the mounts and Polymorph the owners into horses themselves. She likes to ride these victims around the town at high speed, whooping and hollering. She has been arrested more than once. 


# Plot Hooks

* A traveling zoo is passing through the area. If the party attends, the show is attacked by 2 Beastfriends and their canine allies. If the party does not attend, they will espy the Druids leading a docile line of animals through the area (perhaps while camped). In either case, the Beastfriends will attempt to free the animals and escape with as many as they can. If they kill the zoo workers, all the better. 
* A friend of the party sends a letter inviting them to his birthday party in a nearby city. It takes place first at a racing track - dogs are the main event today, and the friend treats the party to a good time, and wins some money. After the race, on the way to the pub to continue the party, the friend is murdered by a snipers crossbow and a letter is found on his body from someone threatening his life. It seems the friend wasn't just a racing fan, but a breeder and owner. The letter orders him to stop what he is doing or else. It isn't signed but there is a bird's clawprint hastily stamped in blood at the bottom. A cabal of Beastfriends is taking down all the animal entertainment in the city simultaneously - there are 5 active cells on a schedule of 10 days. 
* An awakened horse comes to the party and explains that it is a Druid, stuck (cursed) in this form. It begs for help and promises to reward the party with information or whatever you like. The Druid attempted to kill a Hag and failed. She is not close, but not too far either. She is ready for a counter-attack. 
* The party comes across a weeping Druid, surrounded by the corpses of hundreds, perhaps thousands of rabbits. The whole area looks as its been dug up. There is a disease spreading. Its infected the rabbits first, and the Druid says that foxes and wolves are showing signs of it now as well. If asked, the Druid used the Dig spell to uncover the destroyed warrens. The Druid asks for help, and will recall a host of birds (mostly raptors) that he calls, ""the flock"". The birds do not feed on the bounty before them. The Druid speaks to and (mostly) controls them, but cannot predict the stubbornness of birds. The disease is natural, but amplified. Rabies 2.0. Its a mutation of evolution, nothing more. Its going to infect all the mammals if left unchecked. 
* A murderous pack of Wererats has been discovered by a Beastfriend. The Druid has attempted to negotiate their withdrawal from the area, but they have refused, citing good hunting grounds. The Druid has escalated and turned most of the area's rats against the *verminthropes*. The party comes across an open battle between the Beastfriend and a massive swarm of rats, and a group of Wererats caught out in the open. If the party intervenes, they later discover that the Wererats have been turning others, boosting their numbers. If they do not intervene, they find out the same thing, only one of the party members gets infected.

",1,Druids Conclave: The Beastfriend
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,25,536,"**The Lore:**

In addition to letters and numbers, Gnomish children also learn their gears. Cogged gears, toothed gears, worm gears, spiral gears. And not just gears, but catchments, levers, valves, fittings, springs, wires, clasps . . . all the basic types of mechanical pieces that make up the Gnome's mechanical alphabet, the Codex Mechanicus.

Gnomish manufacturing is highly individual and original, but the basis of all early work is the same. One gnome's #4 Toothed Gear should be interchangeable with another's. And the way they learn the parts of the Codex is through rhythm.

A #4 gear is a series of deft movements and sharp blows with hammer and metal chisel: *tap . . . turn, tap,* **BANG**,turn-**BANG**, *swipe*. Continue this same rhythmic pattern for 32 repetitions, and a 32-toothed #4 gear sits on the workbench.

But the true application of the Codex Mechanicus is not in individual pursuits. Instead, this precision allows groups of gnomes to work together and produce parts with an expected fit and function. This, then, is a Gnomish Orchestra.

A piece of Gnomish orchestral music is not only for listening to the rhythms and tones produced from the artisans at their workbenches but also encodes a thing; it is the instructions for its creation. Gnomes gather into distinct sections: Forge (the slow and steady pulse of the bellows requires steady rhythm but little imagination), Wire (the delicate swings require to draw metal and shape it, or the heavier work of creating springs), Gears, Structure, Casting. Some other sections such as Leather, Wood, or Cloth may be independent sections or part of the Miscellany section, depending on the work performed. Each has a Procurer, who oversees the construction within their Section and then delivers the goods to the Assembler, who may have a few Sub-Assemblers, depending on timing and construction.

An orchestral performance is a celebration of an orderly workshop, an appreciation for the rhythmic patterns created, and an exercise in good design. Truly great composers construct pieces where the crescendi of activity and rhythmic complexity coincide with important or meaningful stages of construction, and a virtuoso Assembler can conduct the orchestra to make sure that all Sections produce their goods on a timeline that builds to those points. The Assembler calls intermissions at their discretion, during which time stocks of raw materials are refilled and the audience is invited to view the progress of the construction - but not the individual players' workbenches, of course. The culmination of a Gnomish orchestral piece is usually a large soiree where the finished piece is displayed. Some famous pieces even have the constructed item serving the drinks or carving the food.

So, then, a group of Gnomish school-children at their graduation may perform not a Sonata in G Minor, but instead perform Brickbottle's Ironing Board in Brass and Mahogany.

**The Application:**

This came out of a question to my Gnomish character's player - how is Gnomish music different that Dwarven? He answered that it was a lot of rhythmic tapping and interlocking patterns, like tapping with a hammer or banging on a workbench.

This could be a sort of technical Thieves' Cant. It could be tapped out with a blind man's cane, or put in the irregular drip of water from an unknown spring. It can play into the creation of individual tinker's items. Why did Davros Gogsmacker use five #4 gears when clearly three #6 gears were called for. Is the difference of 2 some sort of code?

The components of the Codex Mechanicus translates back into letters and numbers in a sort of pig-latin-esque manner, so that simply stating ""#3 Worm gear, two lengths of drawn copper wire, a #1 Catchment"" might spell a word. It is long and laborious, but the rhythmic pattern that denotes those same components of the Codex Mechanicus could also be banged out on slave's manacles, a ship's line, or a tavern cup. Other unsuspecting races won't know the information.

In this application, comprehension is based on intelligence (how well do you remember the Codex? How quickly can you decipher the components being conveyed?) while 'speaking' relies on Performance. Maybe your character did poorly in their school's graduation orchestral performance and gets stagefright when trying to play to an audience that understands the Codex.

But it would also allow a Bardic character a deeper dimension to their performance, and a way to tie that directly into a tinkering skill. New creations are new compositions, and can be passed on to other gnomes with high fidelity. Could also have a fighter use it to communicate with tinkered creations or allies, or plenty of applications for a rogue coordinating with other gnomes through cyphered letters or handing off an individual contraption whose components are the code itself.",1,"Gnomish Orchestral Music, or Tinkers' Cant"

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,49,1780,"# Quick Tips For Running a Campaign Using Level Ranges

**Try to plan a campaign per level range**. Most DnD systems are not so granular that you need a hard start at one level and a definitive stop at another. However, using the level scales as a guide can make your job much, much easier.

**Take breaks between campaigns**. Give periods of extended downtime between campaigns (in-game, not necessarily real-time). This will allow your players to cultivate lives, property, and income without awkwardly inserting love interests, small jobs, and shopping into an otherwise urgent campaign.

**Escalate the threats from one to another**. You don't want to reel in a dollar and have your players chase it, give them small victories along the way. But having one threat lead into another will help establish *why your players* are involved.

**Go from tactics to strategy**. Establish that their responsibilities are increasing and emphasize *strategy* as time goes on. Wandering into an enemy encampment works for early levels, though they may need to play it smarter than simply entering enemy tents without a sword drawn. However, make them think about long-term strategy in approaching bigger, more vexing foes. For example, if they want to raid a dragon's lair, going in by themselves with the intent of fighting the dragon the first time around is going to get someone killed.

**Make them feel the weight of their sword (or wand)**. Characters deserve titles or renown as they level up. Keep a log of notable things that happen during the campaign and proliferate the news of those deeds as they increase in level. If a player lands the killing blow on a hill giant, they deserve the epithet ""The Giant-Slayer."" If the characters are captured by the dark elves and manage to escape, they should be aware of how those actions inspire others. Titles are the simplest method, but one that always makes the characters feel special is meeting a fellow adventurer who started traveling because of legends of the player characters.

Your characters will be handling ruffians, resolving conspiracies involving dozens of people, or otherwise encountering threatening but somewhat mundane phenomena.

***Anchor for scale****.""Seven Samurai*."" Freeing a local village from the threat of a group of bandits.

***Example.*** A town built on the side of a mountain has not been heard from for some time. A knight and his retainer went to investigate, but have not returned in two months. The players navigate the wilderness and encounter beasts and malevolent undead until they reach the razed town and find an angered, rampaging yeti.

* players will not usually have many allies yet or be a member of an organization
* players will be acquiring their first common or uncommon magic item in this campaign
* players should be able to reasonably acquire property by the end of the campaign
* players will certainly be recognized for their deeds by local lords during this campaign

# Levels 5 - 10 (Heroes of the realm)

Your characters will be confronting conspiracies for the throne, invaders threatening an entire fief, or curses that may claim the lives of hundreds.

***Anchor for scale****. ""The Fall of Ako Castle.""* Confronting a ruler who has shown despotic behavior.

***Example***. The town in the mountains was ravaged by the yeti because of frost giants encroaching on its territory. Those giants are attempting now to annex the surrounding region, and thrust the local duke out of power. The characters must resist the giant's tyranny and eventually duel him to end his reign. In the process, they take possession of the realm as its true protectorate.

* players will gain the attention of organizations such as mage guilds and knightly orders
* players will have allies and the ability to both muster forces and receive supplies or support from local townships
* players should have property and stakes at this point
* players should have somewhat powerful magic items by the end of this campaign
* players will be acquainted with nobility and powerful figures in the course of the campaign

# Levels 11 - 16 (Masters of the realm)

Your characters will be defending against invasions that put a kingdom's existence at stake, supernatural enemies with hegemonies of their own, or threats to the natural order of a nation.

***Anchor for scale****. ""Henry V.""* Overcoming an apparently insurmountable foe.

***Example***. Now the rulers of a duchy, the players learn the truth that the giants were spurred on by a prophecy that now comes into fruition. The dragon that once ruled the land awakens and lays claim to the kingdom that was once his, and now the players must resist the dragon and his growing influence over their allies. They eventually defeat the dragon and become the rulers of the kingdom itself.

* players should become either among the leaders or the leaders themselves of their respective organizations
* players have strong allies and can exert an amount of control and influence over the surrounding lands
* players own not just land and property, but will certainly have noble titles at this point
* players will come into possession of artifacts or legendary items in the course of this campaign
* players should attain significant political power by the end of this campaign
* players should be recorded as legendary figures or even minor deities by the end of the campaign

# Levels 17 - 20 (Masters of the world)

Your characters will be approached by gods for help defending against planar threats, overthrowing primordial evils, or making peace between deities.

***Anchor for scale***. *""Titanomachy.""* Restoring order to the world (reverse divine intervention).

***Example***. After having their names recorded in history as legendary figures, the players learn that their defeat of the dragon decades prior foretold the end of the world, a sort of Ragnarok, and now the Mother of All Monsters has been freed from her binds created by the gods themselves. The players must work with the gods and end the threat or risk the end of the world. They travel to the Underworld and meet her in not-Tartarus, where she leads armies of undead. With a little divine intervention, the players defeat her and reverse a prophecy made by the gods centuries ago, putting them in the ranks of the divine.

* players should be consistently interacting with divine elements or otherwise recognized as minor deities
* players have the support of not just their kingdom, but even old rivals, as they are now fighting very real world-ending threats
* players possess not just physical property, but are cultural and historical influences
* players should be armed with ancient artifacts and legendary weapons, or forging their own
* players are expected to be recognizable around the world as its saviors by the end of the campaign
* players will have earned a place among the divine and may even be worshiped or at least venerated by the end of the campaign",1,What I've Learned After My Tenth Multi-Year Campaign From Levels 1-20
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,22,421,"Hi r/DnDBehindTheScreen, I've recently been having a massive upsurge in desire to innovate in my game, and to share those innovations with others!

With that in mind I've recently implemented a system in my game that I think a lot of you may find interest in. Skip to the end if you want to just read about the system itself (I talk a lot).

# Genesis

So this idea came about because, at heart, I am a worldbuilder. I have my own setting which I love, and am constantly working to expand and refine it. Now the issue here is that I am very in-depth with all of this - a common refrain for DMs is 'don't design the entire world, design a small area of it and work outwards from there'. But I LIKE coming up with factions, cities, tensions, and obscure items of history; its not irksome to me to put hours of work into my setting.

But I'm well aware that players very much cherry-pick their interest in things like this. I feel the same way when involved in others' games, and its entirely natural that a 20 minute lore dump (no matter how original) makes your eyes glaze over. With that in mind I've found it very important to take a 'show, don't tell' approach with regards to lore.

With that in mind, I wanted another way to introduce items of lore and background to the setting - and so I designed this one by shamelessly stealing from other media.

# Inspiration

The two main sources of inspiration are *Skyrim* (the video game, in case anyone was lost) and *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* (slightly more obscure, a different gaming system in the OSR vein).

The Elder Scrolls lore is incredibly detailed and complex, but if you read into supplemental material its even more involved. Thankfully you are able to do so as much or as little as you so choose, because there is SO MUCH supplemental material in the in-game texts that will enrich the world. I imagine a great deal of players won't know what the Warp in the West is, let alone a kalpa - and that's entirely OK. Just as there's different types of video gamers there's different types of tabletop gamers, but the issue is that D&amp;D is cooperative; if one player **wants** a lore dump and the others don't, its not fair to force that on everyone.

The other inspo was an item in the LotFP book *Vornheim* (I believe - either way check it out, its brilliant). Essentially the phrase was 'snakes are books'. The skins of snakes contain information, which can be deciphered with a snake-reader. This fired my imagination to the extent that it has informed a great deal of my world - snakes aren't the only animal that has a strange dual purpose, and there was a metaphysical event millennia ago called 'the Great Ordering' where the gods forced these purposes on natural creatures. There are plenty of similar articles on Reddit that I've drawn from for this - songbirds eat lies, jackals hunt child murderers - but that's by the by.

# How it works

I will explain exactly how this system applies in my game, and obviously you are free to adapt it to your own as needed.

Essentially not all snakes are books; only those with certain colourations (due to the intermixing of bloodlines in the time since the Great Ordering). My players will come across 'jewelled snake skins' in loot, or can perform a Survival check each day in order to try and find such a snake in the wild.

The skins contain knowledge. Essentially anything that has ever been written down that was valued by the one writing it could find its way onto one of these skins, and the magical effect has not diminished since the Great Ordering; this means the text translated could be from yesterday, or from 2000 years ago.

These skins are ran through an ancient artifact called an anguisolar (faux-Latin here) over a 10 minute period. I describe it with a lot of pseudo-magic terminology, a gem refracting light out of the snake skin and typing up a scroll of knowledge. But the basic outcome is as follows:

|*d100 Roll*|*Outcome*|
|:-|:-|
|1-20|Fragments of knowledge (recover 3 such for a reroll)|
|21-40|Manual - Generally a fairly useless find (a shopping list or diary), I won't write these out. Players can discard these or sell them if I assign them an arbitrary value.|
|41-90|An item of lore. I have a BIG list which they roll on next, with just a skeletal title for each entry. This means they can roll, but I won't have to actually write up the lore entry until they have found the specific one.|
|91-94|Low-level spell scroll|
|95-96|Magic item (a book), or a usable recipe|
|97-98|Mid-level spell scroll|
|99-100|High-level spell scroll|

The benefits of this are many. I upload items of lore into an ever-growing folder in our campaign Google Drive, and the players can read as much or as little of this as they want. Meanwhile, even the players who aren't interested have something of use to find, whether that be simple loot to sell or some far more powerful and magical. You can throw something in that is of direct impact on the current quest line, or a new plot hook. **Important to note:** the table changes based on the skin. Your average snake rolls on the above, but if you're analyzing a dragon or a basilisk, you're almost guaranteed something useful.

It begs the question: why not just have them raid a library or something? Well there are several reasons. The first is that I just think the idea is a cool one, and it fits the world very well. Secondly, there's a hard limit to the amount of information a library can hold, and that information can decay - the way I have set this up there is absolutely no such limit.

Finally, no matter where the players might find themselves in the world they will be able to find a snake like this - but at the same time I can arbitrarily limit the number of jewelled snake skins they find. If someone mentions they haven't used the anguisolar in a while, I can throw jewelled skins in as loot somewhere. If it gets to be a little much, they could over-hunt the population of snakes and have to move to a different region to find any more.

# How to apply to your world

It should be fairly simple, and feel free to change whatever you wish. You can edit the entries on the table if you want to include more or less lore compared to usable loot, and the bare-bones system is adaptable.

Why not get one of your players involved? If they enjoy writing and want to have more input into your setting, there's no reason they couldn't come up with their own lore items (subject to your supervision of course).

As an anecdote when I introduced this one of my players said 'are there really that many snakes in the world? I've never even seen a wild snake in this country.' I was of the opinion they were far more common - and from that moment on snakes were certainly a common sight in my world.

If that's an issue for you (and it shouldn't be), then snakes don't have to be books - maybe butterflies are books, or weasels. I don't really care.

Just have fun with it if you give it a go :)",1,"[Stolen System] Snakes Are Books - or, How to include further lore in your setting"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,42,623,"I’m ~~stealing~~ borrowing the post formula from one u/DeathMcGunz to talk about a lesson I learned early on from video games that has carried over into my DM toolset, and that has helped me recognize at least one area of true, unique potential for tabletop RPGs. The earliest, clear example of inspiration for me is Brave Fencer Musashi or Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, but Monster Hunter is an excellent modern-day example.

##1. Everything is useful if you believe hard enough

* Monster Hunter makes everything in its world useful for *something*. We can take this philosophy and tweak it a bit, since we have the luxury of not being a video game, so we have that human element: adaptability.

* Your party will, eventually, loot something you didn’t account for from a monster, maybe even go out of their way to obtain it. This is the result of years of conditioning from RPGs with crafting systems. Never know when you might need a mimic tooth, after all.

* Don’t shut that down. Lean into it. The players in question are effectively handing you their investment on a silver platter. *Take it.*

* Sidenote: this can become a very useful outlet for a character with proficiency in Survival if they don’t get to use it often. The best parts of the monster can often be the most delicate...

* **Example**: Your party defeats the minotaur skeleton you set as a mini-boss. As they're deciding what to do next, one player says ""Minotaurs are good at charging right? I'm gonna take its skull, maybe I can turn it into a battering ram or something."" You did not prepare to have that minotaur skull *be* anything, but you decide to run with it, telling them that it's certainly possible to do something with the skull.

##2. Help them there, but make them work for it

* Part of the appeal of crafting is the achievement of creating the thing

* Monster Hunter lets you see what you’re making long before you have everything required to make it, encouraging you to hunt and hunt to gather materials

* While that can work depending on the group and campaign, another route you can take is turning the item creation into a quest; whether the challenge is finding someone knowledgeable enough to *make* something out of what you’ve found, or doing a favor for the crafter in question in place of an exorbitant fee, the reward will feel all the sweeter.

* **Example**: That same player takes the minotaur skull to the local smith, but they have *no clue* what to do with the thing. They have heard of a crafter's guild in the capital that makes all sorts of exotic items, maybe they could help you out? Thing is, the roads to that city have been strangely treacherous lately...

##3. Items with personality

* Items that do interesting things beyond a passive numbers boost tend to be more interesting and memorable to players

* Monster Hunter and its ilk often design weapons and armor to be inspired by the things they’re made of, i.e. a creature that breathes fire might be turned into a fire-resistant cloak or a set of daggers that can erupt in flame

* This not only gives your players more interesting options in combat beyond “I’m gonna hit the guy a little more reliably now!” but also gives those items an *identity*, which can get players way more invested and attached to an item; in my experience, a +1 sword always gets dropped as soon as the fighter realizes they can turn a jawbone into a weapon, magical or no.

* This can also have the side-effect of making encounters more memorable if they resulted in a newly-scavenged item; those bulettes you threw at your party to kill time because you didn’t prep can become a treasured memory if the fighter gets a set of bulette-plate armor they slide around on as a result.

* **Example**: After dealing with the gang of Grungs waylaying the road to the capital, the player is able to get their minotaur skull to the craftsman's guild; as a gesture of gratitude for clearing a main trade route for them, they make this player a helm from the minotaur's skull, fashioned so that the skull frames their face. They can now make a charging gore attack while wearing the helm, and get advantage on strength checks when charging an enemy (flavorful and reminiscent of the creature it's made of). The player *loves* this, charging becomes a defining aspect of their combat strategy, and the helm becomes a prized possession. Months later, your players *still* mention the journey to get that helm made.

##4. Making it yours

* Take these philosophies and get creative and wacky, the rules are what you make them

* In Monster Hunter a majority of what you’re hunting is organic parts from big beasties; this is not a restriction for you

* Clearing out a mine full of kobolds and finding a rare ore to make a shield or trinket works just as well as using a mimic’s teeth to make an amorphous dagger for stirring up player investment

* Adjust the nature of reward based on the players you have--maybe those Owlbear feathers will feel more rewarding for your party as a bribe to a local noble rather than a new cloak. The time-honored trick of letting your players give you ideas works wonders here.


* **Examples**: Harvesting a bottle of gelatinous cube slime and having it refined into a potent acid, taking a collection of rare fungus samples from the underdark (you said ""there are mushrooms dotting the floor"" and the druid got excited) and being able to use it to convince a royal apothecary on the surface to get you into an exclusive event at the palace, etc etc.

---

This approach to item design has proved wildly effective for getting more combat-oriented players invested in the game world and has given combat encounters an extra sense of excitement and tension to them: I’ve had more than one occasion where a rumor of a deadly, terrifying monster has spurred a group into action when they otherwise would’ve moved on because “what if we can make something *super cool* out of it?”

It's also worth noting that it's just really fun to make items this way. You haven't lived until you've given a roll-player barbarian a nervous breakdown because they can't decide between weapons *they love*.

---

Lastly, a few examples of items I've made in the past.

##Scorpion Whip
*uncommon magic weapon, whip (requires attunement)*

This leather whip is a blackened brown color, and has a handle shaped like a scorpion. At the whip's end is a large, menacing stinger.

This weapon has 1d4 charges, and regains 1d4 charges each dawn. On a successful attack, you may spend 1 charge to make the stinger inject potent venom into its target. The target must make a Constitution save, taking 3d10 poison damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.

##Rune-Carved Behir Horn

*rare wondrous item, arcane focus (requires attunement)*

This Magic Item can be used as an Arcane Focus, giving a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the caster's spell save DC. When casting an evocation spell that deals a damage type other than thunder or lightning, you may have that spell deal lightning damage instead.

In addition, the horn contains 3 charges, and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. As an action, you may spend a charge to cast the *Spider Climb* spell, targeting yourself.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,87,973,"Many druids work to maintain the natural order, or their perception of it. Some become forces of nature themselves, embodying the elemental forces they revere. Others dedicate themselves to maintaining the Grove, an enduring font of life energy where the Circle convenes. It is a place of worship and governance for the druids, but for the surrounding lands, it can be much more than that; a focal point of the surrounding environment, at once both absorbing and exuding the living energies around it in a self-sustaining feedback loop. The lands feed it, and it feeds the land, and all the while, the druids ensure its health and well-being, like volunteer antibodies on a larger scale.

**The Grove As A Power Source**

Paladins and clerics, even nature clerics, draw their power from deities directly as divine energy. Wizards, sorcerers and warlocks wield arcane might. But druids and rangers draw energy from the more nebulous source of nature, at once both alike and different than both the arcane and divine. I’d like to take this time to posit that a druid’s power stems from her Grove, which is itself an embodiment of her homeland and the aspects of nature she works in service of. With the Earth itself as a conduit, the druid draws his power from the Grove at any distance, provided the Grove is healthy. Should it be destroyed, the druid’s powers will diminish until he claims (or is claimed by) a new Grove.

Mechanically, I suggest treating the Grove as a sort of demigod or creature on par with the most formidable creatures - potent enough to grant Lair Actions to its Archdruid within it’s sphere of influence, and creating region effects appropriate to its biome.

**In the Face of Oblivion**

But what happens when the unthinkable happens, and a Grove faces certain destruction? Then the druid is faced with a dire choice: allow nature to take its course and destroy the Grove, or fulfill his or her duty and preserve it. The loss of the Grove could be catastrophic for the druid and the land they defend, and not just on a physical level; their very purpose, the thing which they’ve dedicated the course of their life towards, is suddenly stripped away, and the druid must either adapt or wither. 

The alternative, then, when a coming threat is judged to be unnatural, or if the druid is unable to accept the fate of the Grove, is transplantation. They may take a clipping, seed or sapling from the Grove and escape, seeking a new place to put down roots as a seed may drift on the wind. With luck, they find a complementary area and settle down, reconstituting the Grove and establishing a new base of power for the Circle while strengthening the new land. And if luck isn’t with them? Then the druid may find herself pushed into an inhospitable climate in a foreign land, forced to establish their new Grove before it perishes. It is here that the druid himself may become a threat to the lands around him, as he and his Grove become an invasive species.

**A Stranger Brings a Strange Land**

From NWF.org: “An invasive species can be any kind of living organism—an amphibian (like the cane toad), plant, insect, fish, fungus, bacteria, or even an organism's seeds or eggs—that is not native to an ecosystem and causes harm. They can harm the environment, the economy, or even human health.”

A new Grove is no less insidious, but for the scope. In the early stages of implantation and growth, the Grove will need to be carefully guarded by the druid, and the few spells it can grant each day will be bent towards preserving it amid an incompatible ecosystem, such as an oak Grove taking root in a desert oasis. But after a point - weeks, months, even years later - the growth may reach a critical mass where the power it lends to the druid is no longer more than it can produce, and it can become self-sustaining. It is then that the true damage begins - the Grove draws in energy from the land, but the energy it exudes is filtered through its own paradigm, and the process of terraforming begins. Slowly, the soil quality turns, precipitation patterns change, transplanted insects and diseases may ravage the locale, and native plant life is driven out by the enhanced over-Grove-th (I’m not apologizing for that pun.) Gradually, even the temperature around a Grove may normalize towards that of its original home.

Needless to say, the local druids will not be pleased that there are now 3 miles of marshland in the middle of their steppes, or a temperate forest jutting from the desert dunes. Assuming they haven’t already done something about it.

**Call and Response**

With this in mind, a foreign Grove taking root can be as devastating to the surrounding lands as whatever cataclysm originally drove it there in the first place. For local druids, it is most likely to be treated as an infection, to be burned out early and aggressively lest it get out of hand. If it cannot be peacefully transplanted, then it might trigger an armed response by a local Circle, or an [Avenger](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a4x6p7/druids_conclave_avenger/). 

Further complicating matters is the fact that these things do not happen in a vacuum. Instability in a region environmentally can contribute to instability politically. If the transplanted Grove brings more temperate weather to a harsh clime, a local lord may see it as a boon, and act to defend and exploit this new asset. On the flip side, an invading “hostile” climate such as arctic tundra or disease-ridden swamp were to gain a foothold in an otherwise standard fantasy European-ish kingdom, disrupting viable farmland or hunting grounds, the local druids may very well have the local army at their backs.

**The Hu**

The Hu are a Quartet of Valor Bards who accompany The Hun Khanate's raiding parties into battle. The raiders fight to the tempo of the Hu's music and are empowered thanks to their magic. By passing orders through specific songs or changes in Tempo, the Raiders are able to work together more effectively as well as use the noise to drown out any orders the enemy may be trying to give. 
Each member of the band is able to offer their own unique buff to their fellow raiders as well as serve as passable combatants should the need arise. 

The band came together several years prior during the celebration of a successful raid against the neighboring City State of Qin. After combining their musical prowess off the field of battle, the group began working out ways to become more than the sum of their parts and help their comrades attain victory in all their engagements. Through constant practice and the blessing of their Khan, the Hu were eventually given command over their own raiding party and drilled their small army to respond to commands issued by musical cues.

By default the Hu use the following buffs in a fight:

**Kublai Temur** casts *Healing Word*

**Ogedei Berke** prefers *Heroism*

**Chagatai Bolad** favors *Bane*

**Delbeg Altan** uses *Bless*


When the band is playing together, they are able to cast first level spells for free and have advantage on concentration checks. In addition, they are able to function similar to a Hag Coven in that their spells slots and known spells are combined. Additionally, while playing together, the Band can spend a single use of bardic inspiration to pass out 1 dice for each member playing. As an effect of how loud they play, all characters within 300 feet of any member of the band are only able to hear the music and are considered deaf to all other sources of noise for the duration of the song. 

**Kublai Temur** is the leader. They play a Morin Khuur in the shape of a black and sapphire stallion. They also provide vocals. Spells they lean toward are Summon Steed, Fly (on the mounts), Expeditious Retreat, and Greater Invisibility.

**Ogedei Berke** plays rhythm on another Morin Khuur. This one is carved to have a fiery Nightmare galloping off of the neck. Ogedei likes to use Crown of Madness, Plant Growth, and Dispel Magic during battles.

**Chagatai Bolad** is the bassist. They play a deep pitched lyre in the shape of a bow and arrow. They prefer to cast Melf's Acid Arrow, Magic Missiles, Flame Arrows, and Swift Quiver.

**Delbeg Altan** plays the drums from Horseback. Their instruments are the ribcages of various beasts and leather made from the skin of fallen foes. Delbeg is a master of battlefield control specializing in spells like Otto's Irresistible Dance, Confusion, Eye Bite, and Programmed Illusion.

In combat The Hu position themselves behind their troops (lightly armored skirmishers on horseback with sabers and shortbows) and begin to play. Be default they use their standard 1st level spells as listed above, but during protracted engagements they are not hesitant to bring out the bigger magic. Ideally they are close enough to a combat that their music makes it impossible for their enemies to pass orders while their own can respond to cues delivered in song. Each member of the group is a capable fighter, but they have to stop playing to enter combat. The exception to this is Chagatai Bolad who's lyre doubles as a light crossbow. An adjutant is able to load it for him while he plays.

For lower level parties adjust the number of members in the group and remove some of the higher level spells like Swift Quiver and Eye Bite.",1,The Hu: Battle Bards

# The Loot

## Aeon Disc

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

Rumoured to have been created by a devout archbishop of Helm, the Aeon Disc is activated automatically the first time a character that is attuned to it would take damage. The damage is negated and they become immune to all damage until the end of their next turn, however they also cannot deal any damage during this time and if they attempt to, it is negated as well. This ability recharges after the character takes a long rest.

# Black Mist Blade

*Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)*

This magical longsword is a deep black colour and, if looked at closely, appears to be slowly swirling. The handle of this weapon is a shining silver in stark contracts to its blade. While wielding and attuned to this weapon you gain the Shell ability.

**Shell:** You may use a standard action to target a willing creature within 30 feet granting them 15 temporary hit points that last for 2 rounds, ending at the start of your second turn after. At the end of this duration or if the Shell ends early, it erupts outwards dealing 3d8 necrotic damage to all opponents within 5 feet. All character affected must make a Constitution Saving Throw of DC 11 + your proficiency bonus, taking half damage on a success. This ability can be used two times per short rest.

# Blade Mail

*Armour (Scale Mail), very rare (requires attunement)*

This armour looks perfectly polished and is decorated with a mane of sharp spikes protruding from around the collar. You have a +2 bonus to AC while wearing this armour. Additionally, you gain the Reflect ability.

**Reflect:** You may activate this ability as a bonus action, causing sharp spikes to grow out of the armour in all directions. For the next minute, when you are hit with a weapon attack you may use your reaction to cause the armour to send a force blast back at the attacker. The attacker must make a Dexterity Saving Throw of DC 11 + your proficiency bonus. They take force damage equal to the damage they dealt to you on a failure, or half as much on a success. This ability can be used 2 times per short rest

# Brooch of Disruption

*Wondrous item, very rare*

A character in possession of this brooch can activate it as an action, creating a 10-foot-area maelstrom originating from a point within 30 feet. When a character begins their turn inside the swirling storm, they must make a Dexterity Saving Throw taking 3d6 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. While inside the maelstrom, a character attempting to cast a spell must make a Concentration check of DC 10 + the spells level. On a failure, the spell is not cast (the spell slot is not used but their action is). This effect can be used once per long rest.

# Buckler

*Armour (shield), Uncommon*

Once per encounter you can activate this item as a bonus action and choose up to 8 willing characters within 40 feet (you may target yourself). This shield coats them in a protective barrier, granting them a +2 bonus to their AC until the end of your next turn.

# Butterfly

*Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)*

Scaling items begin with a base form but can reach Enhanced and Ascended forms, gaining more power as the character they are attuned to uses them and grows. Scaling weapons advancements are directly tied to their attuned character, meaning if a weapon reaches its Ascended form and then a new character attunes to it, the item reverts to its basic form again, however it remembers progress characters have already made with it.

*“Some people say that Avandra is flighty and undependable because she never issues decrees or commands and has so few temples where her followers can gather. But if you think for even a moment that what they say is true, then you should see how long your luck can last after you steal someone’s autonomy.”*  
*-Athtar Reylana, Fortune Keeper*

# Divine Names

Of all the deities, Avandra is referred to by more names than any other. Common monikers and epithets include Lady Luck, The Traveler, Waylander, and Mistress of Fortunes, but she is also often referred to by improvised titles associated with luck, travel, and change.

# Domains

Like the other Prime Deities, Avandra is associated with a specific Ideal that she is the ultimate expression and personification of. She has several domains that fall within her power, but the core of her identity is the Ideal of Autonomy.

**Autonomy.**   
Freedom and the ability to make one's own way is the core ideal of Avandra. This ideal represents self-determination, independence, freedom, and opposes reliance on others, subjugation, and anything that might interfere with somebody's ability to choose their own path.

**Luck.**   
Making choices means taking chances, and so the domain of luck is commonly regarded as part of Avandra's portfolio. Because of this, anyone that gambles, takes risks, or goes for a long shot will often pray to Avandra for extra luck in their endeavors.

**Travel.**   
A part of the core concept of freedom involves exercising that freedom. While some of Avandra’s devout followers settle down and stay in a particular location, she encourages her followers to explore their freedom and experience the world.

**Discovery.**   
Part of having freedom is using it to explore and discover things in the world. Finding new locations, new paths, new creatures, or discovering any other hidden things lend power to Avandra.

# Dogma

As a goddess of freedom and autonomy, Avandra’s dogma is short and sweet. She imposes as little as she can to encourage her followers to make their own way in the worlds they travel.

**Forge Your Own Path.**   
A person’s path through life should always be whatever and wherever they want. Nobody else should wield any power or authority over making that path for them. There is no more abhorrent thing than to steal someone’s choice.

**Promote Independence.**   
Encouraging others to make their own decisions and take charge of their own fate is the best thing you can do to serve others around you. Whenever possible, support others in making their own choices and finding their own paths.

# Tenets

Followers of Autonomy also preach a the following additional tenets to the general population:

**Follow the Winds.**   
Exploration is one of the purest forms of freedom. It comes with risks, but not being bound to anything oppressive is a reward in itself. Travel the roads if you must, but get out in the world and explore everything you can.

**Avoid Dependance**.   
Always make your own decisions about your own life. Do not let others manipulate you or make a decision for you.

**Experience All You Can.**   
Experiencing a variety of things gives you a better wealth of expertise to draw on that can help you make better decisions about the path you choose for yourself.

# Allies of the Faith

Avandra’s allies share a great deal of similarity to her. As a being of freedom, her followers often spend a great deal of time in places that also support the following Ideals:
##Church of Solitude
Often, a life of wandering is also a life of solitude, and as such, many followers of Avandra also respect Lolth and the Ideal of  Solitude. While Lolth’s clergy err much more on the side of avoiding others, those that serve Avandra rarely feel lonely when they spend time alone. 
##Church of Cultivation
Because so many of Avandra’s followers live in wilderness, they are around the flora and fauna that live in them. If these followers live in areas where such life is healthy, they often will admire Cultivation as well. 

##Church of Desolation
Worshippers of Avandra often find themselves in empty areas that are void of civilization and, on occasion, void of life itself. Because of the frequency with which wanderers will find such places, they share a close bond with those that serve the Raven Queen.


# Enemies of the Faith
As a goddess of the ever-changing nature of whims and freedoms, Avandra opposes the following faith traditions.  

##Church of Honor
Because Avandra values freedom, she has difficulty working with Bahamut’s rigid standards of Honor. There is only one oath that is acceptable in her realms, and she will honor no other such promises. 
##Church of Harmony
Erathis’ tendency for maintaining power structures and positions of authority makes her a challenge for Avandra to work with. Rigidity is great for peace, but it is not a helpful thing for freedom and those that would seek to expand the freedoms of others in the world.. 
##Church of Domination
Easily the biggest enemy of Avandra, Gruumsh and his teachings of domination have no place within Avandra’s worship. There is nothing more antithetical to her teachings. Those that follow Domination and push for its authority would seek to impose that authority onto others: restricting their freedom in the process. 


# Clergy &amp; Temples

The majority of those that have dedicated themselves to Avandra work alone or in small groups. Ranks within this faith are really only indicators of experience and dedication, but there aren’t any specific benchmarks for earning a title.Because of how much followers of Avandra value autonomy, they never issue commands or directives. Even when they work in groups with a distinct leader, everybody is there of their own volition and is free to leave if they want to. They can, however, sometimes feel selfish, due to the focus on their own autonomy.

**Favored Ones:**   
The fledgling followers of Avandra are referred to as Favored or Favored Ones. They are the most likely ones to be found in settlements. Diverse in their races, backgrounds, and abilities, Favored Ones often find themselves drawn to wander far and wide.

**Windguide:**   
Those who have followed the dogma of Avandra for long enough, and performed certain requests from her and her Champions are eventually bestowed with the title of Windguide. These individuals can occasionally be found tending to small shrines in the wilderness, but also have a powerful wanderlust.

**Fortune Keeper:**   
The most experienced clergy of Avandra are called Fortune Keepers and, although it’s possible for any dedicated worshippers to achieve this title, the majority of its members belong to races that have naturally longer lives. Many Fortune Keepers can actually be found within cities tending the very few temples and shrines that exist within settlements. Those that do settle down often become storytellers and work to inspire others around them to create their own paths.

## Temple Designs

Proper temples to Avandra are rare, and when they exist, they are more like open shrines with minimal structures around them. There are not generally any typical rooms for shelter and sleep, although occasionally shrines in the wilderness might be protected by a rocky overhang or a dense tree canopy.At the minimum, a shrine to Avandra will contain a small altar or pedestal with her symbol carved into it. These spaces are almost always open to the sky or a natural ceiling above, and lack constructed walls. They also vary widely in terms of accessibility; some are easy to find along well traveled roads, and others can be found in the depths of the earth or the peaks of the tallest mountains. There isn’t any rhyme or reason to where these shrines are erected in the wilderness, but they do sometimes seem to mark special locations.

## Common Symbols &amp; Icons

Mortals use many different symbols for the Mistress of Fortunes, but the most common ones generally consist of a pathway across a calm landscape, flowing lines to indicate a gentle breeze, or a set of double doors that has been left slightly opened. On occasion, the symbol for the Plane of Limbo, where she resides, are also used.Her dedicated worshippers often dress in neutral and earthy tones - a practical color scheme for adventuring and wandering, but some of those that tend towards more regularly travelled paths will wear brighter colors that suit their fancy. Often her followers will carry an item that they discovered in the wilds as a sacred symbol of the Ideal they hold so closely. For Clerics and Paladins, these can function as a holy symbol.

# Holy Days &amp; Festivals

Avandra has two festivals that celebrate her and the Ideal she personifies. Both of these holidays are celebrated in ways that are deeply personal to those that participate. Some celebrate on their own in the solitary wilderness, and others celebrate together in larger cities where there are often more things to experience and investigate.

## Dawn of New Paths

Dedicated to the first step of the journeys through life, this Holy Day is generally a massive festival where people can experience anything their heart desires. Merchants unveil new exotic imports, new foods are served everywhere, and even some illicit substances can often be partaken in the open as long as nobody causes another person harm because of them. This holiday is most often celebrated in early spring.

## Day of Broken Chains

Dedicated to freedom and choice, the Day of Broken Chains tends to be more somber and melancholy at times. It is dedicated to remembering those that lived or died in some sort of prison or captivity, and there are many vigils and services held in their honor. This day is generally celebrated in winter, during the first new moon of the season.

# Avatars &amp; Champions

As a deity of choice, changes, and autonomy, Avandra communicates with her followers through whatever messenger is willing to carry whatever news she sends. Tales of a particular entity that serves her are rare, and most accounts of divine messengers are inconsistent with each other.

## Avatar of Avandra:

When Avandra herself appears to mortals, her form is often in some state of flux due to her subconscious shifting of preferences. Her skin, hair, and eyes may fade from one color to another, and shouldn’t be limited to naturally occurring tones. Likewise, her clothing style can also change as she wills it, but she usually sticks to looser outfits that are easy to move in.

## Champion: Alain Brightmoon

Alain was a halfling woman that grew up as a slave in a brutal environment, and she still bears scars from the heavy metal chains she wore during this time. At some point, she escaped her life of servitude and dedicated her herself to serving the Goddess of Freedom. Eventually she was named a Champion of Avandra and was given the ability to change her form to whatever she desires. Some think that Alain is the first Changeling, but this is generally regarded as just a rumor.

# Known Sects &amp; Cults

Avandra’s worshippers tend to fall into one of two general sects and, although they can be referred to by the following names, there is no formal organization within the followers of Autonomy.

## Sect: The Unguided

The Unguided are more of a category of people that follow Avandra than a more cohesive denomination. They tend to be filled with wanderlust, and though their meandering across the world, gain a special knack for finding hidden places. They usually pride themselves on not needing a guide and their uncanny ability to find things that would normally be obscured.

**Optional Rule: See the Unseen.**   
Windguides and Fortune Keepers that belong in this group are supernaturally good at noticing hidden things. Windguides can use an action to detect secret openings, paths, or other similarly obscured places that are in line of sight and not hidden by magic. A Fortune Keeper can locate any hidden places within 120ft, even if they are magically hidden. Both Fortune Keepers and Windguides can perform do this even when blinded.

## Sect: Chain Breakers

A very private, insular, and secretive sect that follows Avandra, the Chain Breakers care more about freeing people in prisons or slavery than almost anything else. In areas where slavery is more prominent, membership in this sect is often punishable by death.

**Optional Rule: Catch Me if You Can**.   
Windguides and Fortune Keepers that belong to this sect are practically impossible to capture. Once per day, a Windguide can use an action to channel the power of Autonomy to automatically free themselves from any kind of nonmagical bindings and have advantage to avoid spells that would dominate, restrain, or paralyze them. A Fortune keeper can extend this ability to target one creature within 30ft of them. Additionally, a Fortune Keeper can never be held against their will unless a rare or rarer magic item is used, but a Fortune Keeper has advantage on saves to avoid the effect of any such item.

Additional notes:

1. Freedom vs. Anarchy: Avandra doesn’t get along easily with heavily structured civilizations due to the affinity that most governments have with imposing on personal freedoms in one way or another. However, she doesn’t advocate for anarchy; instead she promotes personal choice. A few of her most dedicated followers live and thrive in cities and towns with powerful governmental authorities. Her followers, however, do not necessarily feel exactly as she does and may hold more active grudges towards governments and officials.",1,Autonomy: Avandra
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,45,"# Intro

This post describes a scenario that takes place in the Fall — characters get lost in an enchanted forest, rescue a few innocents, and get invited to a celebration hosted by the Autumn Princess. One of the party’s adversaries has called in a debt owed by the Autumn Princess, requiring her to torment and trouble the party as they wander the woods. My party is a group of mystery-solving high school students, but feel free to change the flavor text to suit your campaign.

I’m running this adventure in Monster of the Week, but I’ll include parenthetical suggestions for roll conversions to D&amp;D 5E. I’m not going to include many monster stats; there are only a few combat encounters, and you should tailor them to the capabilities of your characters.

# Overview

The characters are on a field trip in the woods to enjoy the last vestiges of the fall foliage. They have a few conversations with NPCs on the bus ride over, and arrive at the parking site at 8am. They are told to be back by 4pm because the sun sets early this time of year. The characters will wander through the woods having encounters and probably getting lost. They will have opportunities to rescue some of the NPCs they met on the bus. They may obtain invitations to the Autumn Princess' celebration that begins at twilight, around 5pm. The scenario ends when the characters either leave on the bus or complete the celebration encounters.

There are only a few combat encounters in the scenario, and characters should learn quickly that being rude or aggressive to the faeries will not get them what they want.

**Premonition:** If any of your characters have a premonition-like ability, give them a vision of three faceless students swinging dead from the trees in a leafless forest. These represent the three students that the party will need to rescue from faerie mischief.

# Time

The scenario begins at 8am when the bus drops off the characters at location 1. Unless specified otherwise, traveling to and encountering a location for the first time takes about 30 minutes; subsequent travel between locations that have already been visited takes 15 minutes. The characters have 8 hours to explore the forest before the bus leaves, which should give them enough time to visit all 13 locations unless they waste time or get delayed. The bus will leave at 4pm; if the characters or any named NPCs aren’t present they will be replaced by fey imposters. (Resolve this as a follow-on adventure if desired.)

The characters should be allowed to keep accurate track of the time.

# NPCs

There are four main human NPCs (along with dozens of other students you can make up if needed). The characters should talk with all of them on the bus ride to the forest. The three students described below will be encountered in the forest and will require rescue.

**Teacher: Barry Johnson**, the teacher leading the field trip. He stays with the bus and is generally unhelpful to the characters, except to remind them to be back by 4pm.

**Woodsmen leader: Jaime Bass** is the leader of a student club called the Woodsmen. He is cocky and overbearing, but not unfriendly. The Woodsmen believe in dominating nature: hunting, camping, fishing, survival. They don’t get along with the Ornithologists.

**Ornithology Club leader: Ramiro Ballard** is the leader of the student ornithology club. He is arrogant and smug, but not unfriendly. The ornithology club believes in protecting and preserving nature, taking nothing but pictures. They don’t get along with the Woodsmen.

**Gaian mystic: Joanne Cobb** is a spiritualist student who believes that nature is imbued with supernatural power. She is eager to commune with the ""nature spirits"" in the forest, and is happy to talk at length about the blessings of Gaia. She has no real knowledge about any of the supernatural occurrences in the forest. She doesn’t like the Ornithologists or Woodsmen, who in return think she is goofy at best.

**Faeries:** The characters will encounter numerous faeries in the forest. All the faeries know that the the party’s adversary has forced the Autumn Princess into playing tricks on the party, and they’ll hint at this more as the day progresses. All the faeries should be played as tricky and condescending, but they’ll be impressed by clever, witty, tricky characters with good manners. They generally have no desire to fight, and will flee if threatened or attacked. The faeries can be in many forms: pixies, satyrs, dryads, talking animals, leprechauns, etc. Use whatever form suits you for each faerie.

# Invitations

The characters will likely obtain invitations to the celebration being thrown by the Autumn Princess. Each invitation is automatically inscribed with the name of the character who first touches it, and each character will need an invitation with their name to attend the celebration. The characters will discover the location of the celebration during their exploration in the woods.

&gt; ""The Autumn Princess cordially requests the presence of &lt;character name here&gt; at her Fall Foliage Celebration this evening at twilight.""  

# Locations overview

The forest is colorful and bright, and the leaves are just starting to fall in great quantity. The leaves and branches rustle in every breeze. The forest floor and the paths are covered in a thick layer of crackling, dry leaves. The air is cool and crisp, and the sun it bright and clear. It’s a beautiful fall day!

There are 13 numbered locations in the forest, and it may be helpful to think of them as if they were placed in a circle around a 13-hour clock. Most locations have three exits: left, right, and backwards. Unless otherwise specified, the left path goes to the location +2 from the current location, the right path goes +3 from the current location, and the backwards path goes to -5 from the current location. (Left and right go clockwise, backwards goes counterclockwise.) This means that the players can’t easily return to where they just came from, as the “backwards” path doesn’t go back to where they left. As mentioned above, assume it takes 30 minutes to move to a location and encounter it for the first time, and 15 minutes to move between locations that have already been visited.

For example: From the bus (location 1), if the characters go left they will arrive at location 3; if they go right they will arrive at location 4; if they go backwards they will arrive at location 9. (Imagine a 13-hour clock, and move counterclockwise 5 spaces from 1.)

Each location has a description that includes a “landmark” element that occurs in a quantity that corresponds to the location’s number. For example, location 1 has one bus, and location 3 has three big trees. You should make these elements obvious to your players. Don’t make the navigation puzzle too hard! Give them hints that movement through the forest is *weird*, but that there is a method to the madness.

If the players decide to go off-road instead of following a path, each character should roll +Cool (hard Wisdom saving throw) and take 1 harm ignore armor on a partial success or 2 harm ignore armor on a failure. Then roll 1d12 and move them to that location. (You can’t get to location 13 without following a path.)

## Location 1: The Bus

Exits: Left: 3. Right/middle: 4. Backwards: 9. (Left and right both go clockwise; “backwards” here can be portrayed as a counterclockwise path along the trail.)

The bus parks in an otherwise empty parking lot at the trailhead at 8am and the students all scatter into the woods. Mr. Barry Johnson waits here; he doesn't see anything unusual and is not particularly helpful to the party, but he has water and snacks. He can provide first aid or call an ambulance if necessary. He reminds the students frequently that the bus will leave at 4pm.

There are three paths into the forest, and a map of the hiking trail. The map shows that the trail goes in a circle approximately 6 miles in circumference, with the trailhead at the north of the circle. The map shows several landmarks if you head clockwise: a waterfall, a scenic overlook, a camping site, and then you return to the trailhead. If you head counterclockwise, you can visit the landmarks in reverse order. (This map is generally correct, and should provide a useful topology for the players.)

## Location 2: Cottages and tea party

Left: 4. Right: 5. Back: 10.

In this clearing there are two quaint cottages, each with a white picket fence and a small, well-tended garden. On the lawn between the cottages is a table set for a tea party, and four figures in fancy clothes are sitting and arguing: a young couple named Bill and Billie Robin, and an older couple named Jim and Stacy Keen. (They’re all faeries.) As the characters approach they discern that the figures are arguing about etiquette. 

If the characters are respectful and courteous they will be invited to have tea with the foursome. Each character rolls +Sharp (medium History check), and on a partial success that character has behaved properly and improved their etiquette; on a complete success that character has also impressed their hosts and can get a question usefully answered. (Characters who succeed will receive +2 forward (advantage) for the feast etiquette check at location 13 during the celebration.)

## Location 3: Three trees

Left: 5. Right: 6. Back: 11.

Three large, ancient trees grow at a fork in the trail. The tree by the left fork bears apples, the tree by the right fork bears pomegranates, and the tree by the backwards path bears pinecones. A character can eat an apple to restore a max of 2 harm per visit. A character who eats a pomegranate rolls +Weird (medium Constitution saving throw); on a complete or partial success the character can see into the invisible world of faerie for several minutes; on a partial success or a failure the character is shocked by the prismatic beauty of the faerie realm and takes 1 harm ignore armor. The first character who eats a pinecone discovers an invitation with their name on it.

Characters can pick one of each fruit per person to bring with them; trying to pick more fruit causes the trees to curl up their branches and pull the fruit away. (The pomegranates may be particularly useful at locations 10 and 12.)

## Location 4: Four statues, four paths

Left: 6. Right: 7. Back: 12.

Four imposing stone statues stand in a small clearing, one by each of four paths: a lion to the left, a leprechaun to the right, a dancing couple backwards, and a human child by a narrow fourth path that heads into the woods. If the characters take the fourth path into the woods, roll 1d13 to determine where they end up.

A dejected gnome sculptor named Grimly is sitting on the ground. He looks up with expectation when the characters arrive, but then slumps down again when he sees who they are. He ignores the characters unless they address him directly. Grimly is upset because his apprentice borrowed his sculpting tools to obtain some gems from a nearby cave and hasn’t returned. He offers the party his invitation to the celebration if they can return his apprentice and tools to him. (The tools are at location 8; the dead apprentice is at location 9.)

## Location 5: Waterfall pool

Left: 7. Right: 8. Back: 13.

This location is centered on a quiet pool with a beautiful waterfall, wherein five dryads are bathing and preparing for the celebration. When the characters approach have everyone roll +Cool (medium Stealth check) to sneak up on Ornithologist Ramiro Ballard who is hiding in the bushes taking pictures of the dryads. If the characters fail the +Cool check or otherwise make noise confronting Ramiro Ballard, the dryads notice and squeal in shock. 

Ramiro Ballard panics and runs into the woods, and the dryads confront the characters. Each character must succeed at a +Cool roll (hard Wisdom saving throw) to resist the allure of the dryads. Any character who fails is irresistibly drawn to a dryad and kisses it; characters who pass may still choose to kiss a dryad. Characters who kiss a dryad must roll +Charm (medium Charisma check); on a success the kiss pleases the dryad, but on a partial success the character is also charmed; on a failure, the dryad mocks the kisser and dismisses them. Whichever character succeeds by the most receives an invitation to the celebration, and a promise from the dryad to meet there. Charmed characters must make every effort to see the dryads again at the celebration.

Ramiro Ballard returns safely to the bus and is eager to publish the pictures he has taken of the dryads unless the players prevent it (+Charm (hard Persuasion check) to convince him, or some other method to steal the camera, etc.).

## Location 6: Traps

Left: 8. Right: 9. Back: 1.

There are six traps scattered around this clearing, one of which has caught a ferocious lion by the hind leg. (Needless to day, lions are not native to the area.) The lion growls and snarls at the characters, and swipes at them if they approach. Two characters working together can free the lion if one protects the other by succeeding on a +Tough roll (medium Strength check) and the other succeeds on a roll appropriate to their method of opening the trap (+Magic, +Cool, etc.; medium Slight of Hand check). Lion swipes do 2 harm and negate one hold from a successful roll if the characters don’t work together.

If the lion is freed it roars in thanks and drops an invitation to the feast before bounding into the woods. The lion can be heard roaring in the forest for the rest of the scenario, but doesn't pose any more danger to anyone. He will show up again at the celebration.

## Location 7: Rainbow’s end

Left: 9. Right: 10. Back: 2.

A rainbow plunges through the trees and ends in this small clearing (rainbow == seven colors). At the base of the rainbow is a small, locked chest that can be opened with success on any appropriate roll (+Tough to break it, +Magic to disenchant it, etc.; medium Pick Lock check). On a success the chest opens and the characters find a pot of gold and an invitation to the feast; if it’s only a partial success, the red cap (below) appears immediately. On a failure, the sunlight shifts and the rainbow disappears until/unless the characters leave and return.

If the gold or invitation is taken the characters will be hunted by the red cap named Friendly Joe who owns the chest. Each time the characters travel to a new location (excluding 13 after the celebration begins) there is a 25% chance that Friendly Joe appears and attacks to recover his belongings. Health 8, 2-harm close attack or 1-harm area-effect rainbow blast that gives -1 forward to attack the red cap. Friendly Joe will fight to the death, but he doesn’t actually die, he just explodes into a burst of bloody, rainbow mist and shows up again at the celebration.

## Location 8: Dark grove

Left: 10. Right: 11. Back: 3.

This area of the forest is dark, creepy, and covered in cobwebs. The characters hear distant cries for help but can’t discern their direction; they will need to create a light source of some kind to pick any direction other than backwards (to location 3). If they create light they quickly attract Woodsman Jaime Bass who has been lost here, as well as a group of large spiders (8 legs) that do not attack, but watch them all closely from the gloom.

With light, the characters will see bundles wound up in the cobwebs. If any character messes with the webs this provokes the spiders to shoot them with webs; each character must roll +Tough (hard Strength saving throw) and on a failure they get stuck. Spend 10 extra minutes escaping the webs for each character who fails the test, or 5 minutes per partial success. If they search the webs, success on +Sharp (medium Perception test) will reveal several desiccated bodies as well as the sculptor’s tool box (from location 4) in the webs. The box was dropped here by the apprentice, whose body is at location 9.

Jamie Bass is eager to leave the forest and returns safely to the bus. He is obviously traumatized, and the characters should discern that he will eventually share his supernatural experience unless they help him somehow (+Charm/Sharp (hard Persuasion/Deception check) to reassure him or convince him he didn't see anything).

## Location 9: Cave

Left: 11. Right: 12. Back: 4.

There’s a dark cave here with a small humanoid corpse covered with spider webs lying at the mouth. If the characters avoid the cave and corpse, nothing happens. If the characters enter the cave or inspect the corpse, they are attacked by a 9-headed hydra that bursts out of the cave with a roar.

The hydra has Health 12, 1-harm bite ignore armor. When it is reduced to half-health it attempts to retreat into the cave, but will fight to the death if cornered. If it is killed the Autumn Princess will be upset, since it is her pet (-2 forward on all celebration tests (disadvantage)).

The gnome corpse is the sculptor’s apprentice from location 4, but the tools aren’t here (they're at location 8). The corpse’s clothing is covered in webs from location 8, and an invitation to the celebration can be easily found in the coat pocket. In the back of the cave is a shed hydra skin that will be valuable for magic rituals of various sorts.

## Location 10: Scenic overlook

Left: 12. Right: 13. Back: 5.

The path leads to a high clifftop that overlooks a river far below. This scenic overlook is home to a zephyr, an invisible wind fairy. When the characters approach the overlook they hear a voice crying for help from over the edge of the cliff; it can sound like any of the NPCs that haven’t been rescued yet. If anyone approaches the edge, the zephyr will attempt to blow them off. Each character near the edge rolls +Cool (medium Dexterity saving throw) to avoid being blown over; characters not near the edge can roll +Cool (medium Athletics check) to Help Out another character and give +1 to their roll. Any character blown off the edge feels like they’re going to plummet to their death, but actually lands on an outcrop 20 feet down and takes 2 harm ignore armor. There are 10 bones scattered on the outcrop. Each character who falls needs to roll +Tough (hard Athletics check) to climb back up, taking 0 minutes on a complete success, 10 minutes on a partial success, or 20 minutes on a failure. (Characters can all climb at once, so only the worst result actually advances the clock.)

After the zephyr attempts to throw the characters off the cliff it laughs at them uncontrollably until they leave the location.

## Location 11: Mushroom ring

Left: 13. Right: 1. Back: 6.

Joanne Cobb the Gaian mystic is meditating here in the middle of a circle of 11 large mushrooms. Her eyes are closed and she is totally unresponsive. Any character who wants to investigate her must step into the circle and succeed on a +Sharp roll (medium Charisma saving throw) or become entranced themselves. A character who steps into the circle can get close enough to roll +Sharp (medium Arcana check) to investigate her, and spend holds to discover that she isn’t breathing and is in a magical trance. Entranced or not, everyone who steps into the circle of mushrooms has a kaleidoscopic vision of dancing lights enveloping their body and then pouring into their eye sockets. If anyone avoids the trance or stays outside the circle, they can wake everyone up with a magic ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform and requires success on a +Weird roll (medium Arcana check). If everyone is entranced they wake up 30 minutes later outside the circle, along with Joanne Cobb.

Joanne Cobb is grateful for being rescued and asks to accompany the party. If they refuse, she sets off through the woods on her own. If they agree, she mysteriously disappears among the trees when they move to another location. Either way, she returns safely to the bus and won’t stop telling everyone about her mystical experience unless the party convinces her to keep quiet with success on a +Charm roll (hard Persuasion check).

## Location 12: Clearing

Left: 1. Right: 2. Back: 7.

This large clearing is filled with elaborate music with no discernible source. A dozen pairs of invisible faeries are dancing in the clearing, practicing for the celebration. Success on a +Sharp roll (medium Investigate check) can help the characters figure out what’s happening with sound and touch clues, and a magic ritual that takes 10 minutes and requires success on a +Magic roll (hard Arcana check) can reveal the faeries. (Or the characters can eat pomegranates from location 3 or use some other method to see the invisible.)

If the characters are polite and well-mannered, when the faeries are revealed they will invite the characters to dance with them. Characters who decide to participate in the dance must roll +Cool (medium Athletics check); on a success they do well and learn the dance that will be performed at the celebration, gaining +1 (partial) or +2 (complete) forward (advantage) if they dance at the celebration. The faeries laugh at characters who fail the check.

## Location 13: Feast / Camp ground

Left: 2. Right: 3. Back: 8.

This location is a large campground gathering area with 13 trestle tables; there are no humans here, but dozens of faeries.

*Before 5pm/twilight:* A hoard of faeries is setting up for the celebration. Most of the faeries are too busy to talk to visitors. A large, well-spoken ogre named Crom will eventually approach the party and tell them that the feast doesn’t start until twilight, and they should return then. He doesn’t much care if the party stays to watch preparations, but he tells them they have to leave before twilight if they don’t have an invitation from the Autumn Princess.

*After 5pm/twilight:* Crom will not let the characters stay without invitations. If the characters all have invitations with their names on them, they are admitted to the celebration. If the characters have the right number of invitations but not the right names, the group must attain one success on +Charm rolls (hard Persuasion check) per person without their name on an invitation. If the characters don’t have enough invitations Crom will tell them to leave. If they refuse to leave, Crom will reel back as if he is going to punch them, but then throw faerie dust on them that knocks them unconscious. The party wakes up at location 1 the next morning at dawn.

If the party is admitted Crom seats them at main table. Faeries that the party encountered in the forest are all in attendance, including the Cave Hydra, the lion, Friendly Joe the red cap, the zephyr, the tea partiers, the dryads, the sculptor, the dancers, and even a few spiders lingering high in the tree branches. They are all peaceful at the celebration, if not friendly.

Shortly after the party arrives trumpets announce the arrival of the Autumn Princess who appears in a whirlwind of crackling leaves. The Autumn Princess is powerful, friendly, and beautiful; the party guests adore her. She greets her guests and wishes them the joy and comfort of the season. When she finishes speaking, an avalanche of leaves blows onto the tables, and each leaf turns into a magnificent plate of food.

A faerie feast is an elegant affair; each character must roll +Sharp (hard History check) to use the proper manners; characters who learned etiquette at location 2 get +2 forward (advantage) on this test. Those who completely succeed gain the attention of the Autumn Princess. If anyone succeeds even partially, the Autumn Princess tells them that she has enjoyed playing with / tormenting them throughout the day, and that she now considers her debt to the party’s adversary discharged; she hopes that the group enjoys the rest of her party.

After the feast is a formal dance, and each character who chooses to participate must roll +Cool (hard Athletics check) to perform correctly; characters who learned the dance at location 12 get +1 or +2 forward (advantage) on the test. Those who completely succeed gain the attention of the Autumn Princess. Those who fail are the object of mockery.

If any character got complete successes at both the feast and the dance, they have impressed the Autumn Princess and gained her favor. After the dance the Autumn Princess will call on those she favors to kneel before her. She praises those who kneel and bestows on them the title Knight of the Falling Leaves. This boon entitles the bearer to a seat at the Autumn Princess’ celebration every year and will give the bearer a reputation with other fey creatures (positive or negative, depending on the relationship of the fey with the Autumn Princess).

The celebration continues throughout the night, and the characters may interact with the other guests if they desire. Just before dawn they all fall asleep, and when they wake up at sunrise no sign of the faerie court remains.",1,"Fall Foliage Celebration, a faerie adventure"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,58,1276,"One of my biggest issues when I first started DMing was remembering NPCs. I'd have to make someone up on the fly, or forget a quirk for a guard the party had taken a liking to, and it always felt terrible to inadvertently give my group a peek behind the curtain. To compensate for my lackluster memory, I developed a template for NPC generation that's relatively short, sweet, and hits all the most important points for your standard non-player character. The template goes as follows:

* Name - Occupation or Role (Race and Class, if applicable)  
* 3 General character traits  
* 3 values, one of which must be unusual given what you've put down so far (that's my personal preference, anyway)  
* 1 quirk
* A secret or plot hook, something the players can pursue if they take a shine to this person  
* 1 bond of some kind, good or bad

This gives you everything you need to have a rough idea of how the character would act or react, plus you've got some juicy quest or gossip for any player that decides to invest in this little corner of your world. On top of that, it all fits comfortable on a 3x5 note card which makes them ridiculously easy to organize!

This method has been not only wildly helpful for me in terms of remembering details of my NPCs and keeping them organized in my head, it's also made it much easier for me to create more complex, fleshed out characters, which increases the chances that your players will *become* invested in the first place. It also serves as a straightforward template, so you can make up a character as you need them, write a name down on a note card, and just fill it out when you have 5 minutes to spare. It's really changed my prep game, and maybe it'll help you out too. Here are a few examples of my own:

###Harla Dunhain - Mercenary (Female Dwarf Fighter)  
#####-Tough, Friendly, Hot-headed  
#####-Values: knitting, fresh water, being active  
#####-Likes to show off her strength  
#####-Framed for murder in Kor'Kruil, is a wanted criminal
#####-Friends with Corine Welby, a fellow mercenary

---

###Tonk - Orphan (Male Goblin)  
#####-Blunt, Skeptical, Surly  
#####-Values freedom, good food, feeling useful  
#####-Loves to draw but is shy about it  
#####-What's left of his family has been enslaved in the nearby woods, wants to free them but doesn't know how and is scared to go alone  
#####-Was taken in by a local innkeep, Varkin Sol",1,Note-card NPCs: A quick and easy template for fleshing out and referencing your NPCs
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,24,153,"No Dnd world is complete without a few badasses who are in charge of everything. The headmistress of the ancient mage academy, the wizened old fighter who has slain 13 dragons singlehandedly, and the necromancer who threatens to rule the world. Having extremely powerful NPC's is both fun for the DM and the players, and creates a world that is more believable and entertaining. Being able to interact with these nigh-omnipotent figures is an incredible aspect of Dnd, and gives the players a goal to aspire to and become great themselves.



However, these ultra-powerful figures can be hard to handle, as they can severely unbalance the campaign if left unchecked. If the headmistress were to go on a single adventure with the party of Level 5 characters, she would completely dwarf them in scope and power and make the session no fun for the players. A villain who is nearing demigod status, and is intended to be the endgame goal of the players, is someone who will rarely interact with the players in any serious fashion, as doing so will mean an easy total party kill (TPK). Today I am going to offer some tips and tricks on how to incorporate ultra powerful figures into your campaign, without upturning the balance of the world. 

#Powerful Allies

Giving the players powerful allies is one of the coolest things we can do as a DM to help the players. When you tell them that an Ancient Gold Dragon is on their side they will feel invincible. But the problem lies in the fact that this ally, is someone who can realistically never join the party. If you have to start throwing demons at your players to make the encounter more challenging, one swipe later and an unlucky party member may have to start rolling up some new stats. But this doesn't mean you can't introduce powerful allies to the party, you just have to think it through first.



One of the most iconic examples of a powerful ally done well is Gandalf in Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is clearly the most experienced member of the group and was much stronger than everyone else there. And yet despite Gandalf's immense power, he plays a very small part of the story. There are 2 reasons for this. First Gandalf had other more pressing concerns to deal with. In the Mines of Moria, the party encountered the Balrog, a demon that would wipe the party. Had Gandalf not intervened, and told the party ""Fly you fools"" we would have had a much different series as a result. Distracting the overpowered character with a task that only they can do can keep them out of the parties way.

The second thing is that his goals are slightly different from what the parties goal is. There are many different ways to make their goals different yet still in line with each other so that they are allies. In the case of Gandalf, he could not have the direct goal of ""Bring the ring to Mordor"" as he is physically incapable of that. Instead, Gandalf had similar motives that were in line with what he wanted to happen. Gandalf wanted to defeat Saruman, and then he wanted to save Gondor, doing all of this to create a powerful distraction so that Frodo and Sam could deliver the ring to the volcano. He never directly helps the party members, but indirectly helps them by achieving goals that still aid the party in their quest. 



#Dominant Villains

The direct opposite of the ally is, of course, the villain, and making these characters the most powerful beings in the world is part of the fun. But we come across the same problem where these ultra-powerful characters are too much for the party to handle, and so this villain that the party was supposed to be hating since day one, doesn't get to have any true interaction with the party. You can't create someone who kills anyone who displeases them and then introduce to them the party, as they will inevitably become displeased with them. 

Fortunately, dealing with powerful villains in relation to the party is much easier than dealing with allies. The first thing you can do with a villain that is extremely powerful is to never let the party ever directly interact with them. Sauron's presence in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is limited to the point where the party defeats him without even encountering him. By using surrogate villains and armies, you can still have the villain be a massive threat of the campaign, without putting the risk of a TPK on the line every time the players have to interact with the bad guys.



Another way to handle the party full of weaklings is to show the party that there is no way they can directly take on this kind of villain yet. Warning them at how powerful the villain is is largely going to be ineffective, as they will just choose to charge right in anyways. Instead of telling them the villain is dangerous, show them the villain is dangerous through other methods. Show the aftermath of a town after the villain swept through, introduce a powerful ally and then have the villain tear them to shreds, or even have the villain beat them within an inch of their lives in an attempt to humiliate them. And if none of the above methods work, feel free to kill your players the next time they choose to travel to their castle and taunt the villain. If they do not understand the gravitas of the situation after you have given sufficient evidence to suggest otherwise, they deserve to roll a new character. But only do this if you have sufficiently warned them, otherwise the players will feel like their deaths were cheap.

#Conclusion

Handling powerful NPC's is a daunting prospect. The amount of unbalance they can bring to a campaign can be staggering if not done right, but the reward of doing so is very much worth it. Handling powerful allies usually involves distracting them sufficiently so that they don't get tangled with the affairs of the party while dealing with powerful villains usually involves convincing the party to stay away from them until they are ready to handle them. How do you guys handle your powerful NPC's? I'd love to hear what everyone has to say in the comments below.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,59,384,"Yesterday, I commented on a post [Power Choice, not Power Creep](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a4qs2b/power_choice_not_power_creep/) and mentioned a system of magic tattoos that I created for a campaign a while back. A few people replied, asking me to post the full list of tattoos, so here it is! This system was created for 5e, and is balanced accordingly. I have done my best to make sure that there is minimal overlap or interplay with class features, so if there is, it is likely intentional.

While some of these penalties might seem rather harsh, that is the intent. The goal of this system is to create options that, instead of scaling by level, scale by situation. Tattooing a Sigil or Glyph shouldn't be something done lightly, and activating it should be relatively rare. Part of the risk associated with using certain Sigils can be negated by metagaming, and while that is unfortunate, it is unavoidable. 

So far as flavor goes, I usually describe the tattoos as appearing to be plain black ink that crawl and slither across the skin when activated. There are a few tattoos that have additional flavor text written in their descriptions, and as always in D&amp;D, the specific beats the general. 

&amp;#x200B;

# General Rules

These rules apply to all tattoos on the list, unless otherwise noted in the description of a specific Sigil or Glyph. 

* Sigils are significantly stronger than Glyphs, and therefore have much higher penalties than a Glyph would.
* Unless otherwise noted, activating a Sigil or Glyph is a Main Action &amp; can only be done on your turn.
* Any damage taken by using a Sigil is instantaneous, and ignores all resistances, immunities, or vulnerabilities. 
* While a person might choose to have multiple Glyphs, only one Sigil can be tattooed on a given person. The patterns and symbols involved in creating the Sigil are significantly more complex, and take up much more of the skin; multiple Sigils simply wouldn't fit.
   * A Sigil and a Glyph can both be tattooed on the same person.
* Sigils and Glyphs are tattoos, and therefore intended to be permanent additions to the body. Removal can be made available at DM discretion, but I personally recommend keeping them as permanent. This helps keep some of the effects balanced.

# Sigils

* *Ignis Anima*: Focusing your energy through the Sigil, select one target that you can see and, as an Action, kill them. Simultaneously with their death, take damage equal to 1d6 x 10 (10,20,30,40,50,60) percent of your target's remaining HP when you activated the Sigil. 
   * E.g. Fighting an Ancient Red Dragon (MM pg. 97) that has 546 HP, you choose to activate this Sigil. Roll 1d6, multiply the result by 10, average being 40. The Ancient Red Dragon is dead, and you take damage equal to 40% of 546, which would be 218.4, rounded down to 218. 
* *Blade of the Reaper*: The Sigil glows with a deep violet aura, which lances out and strikes down your foe(s). Select up to 3 targets that you can see to be reaped. Permanently subtract the sum of their CR from your Max HP. If this lowers your Max HP below your current HP, the difference is considered Temporary HP.
   * E.g. Fighting a CR10 Deva (MM pg. 16), a CR18 Demilich (MM pg. 48) &amp; a CR13 Adult White Dragon (MM pg. 101), you choose to activate this Sigil. You have 78/114 HP. Insta-Kill these 3 creatures, and subtract 41 from your Max HP. You now have 73 Max HP, and 5 Temporary Hit Points, for a total of 78/73 HP. 
* *Overload*: The next spell you cast is upcast at 9th level, but uses the default spell slot. The spell is an automatic critical hit, and does maximum damage. At the end of your turn, subtract 1 from your Spell Casting Ability; this is recovered after a Long Rest. This Sigil can only be used in conjunction with spells for which an attack roll is made. Spells for which the target must make a saving throw are incompatible. Activating this Sigil is a Bonus Action.
   * E.g. Inflict Wounds, 1st level, Melee Spell Attack. Activate this glyph, cast it as a 9th level spell, but still only use the 1st level spell slot. Auto-crits at maximum damage, which means 10d10 = 100, double the dice, 200. At the end of your turn, subtract one from your Spell Casting ability. 

# Glyphs

* *Glyph of Power*: By sending power through your body, you can temporarily exceed your limits. Take 1d6 damage for each point needed to succeed on an Ability Check, Attack Roll, or Saving Throw. If you use this ability more than once per long rest, permanently subtract 1 point from your CON Score per additional use. This Glyph can be activated at will, following an Ability Check, Attack Roll, or Saving Throw. 
   * E.g. If you rolled a 17 on a DC20 Skill Check, you can choose to activate this Glyph, take 3d6 damage, and beat the DC. 
* *Glyph of* &lt;Ability&gt;: There are 6 of these, one for each of the 6 Ability Scores. Runic symbols are tattooed across your body, enhancing your natural ability. The Glyph provides a bonus equivalent to your Proficiency Bonus to the relevant ability score; this Glyph is always active. These symbols, while not taking up much space, conflict with each other; therefore, only a single ability can be enhanced in this way. After each Long Rest, make a DC8 saving throw for whichever ability has been enhanced. On a failure, the benefits of the Glyph are halved. 3 successful saves in a row remove this requirement, but 3 failed saves in a row permanently halve the effects of the Glyph.
   * E.g. If your 2nd level Rogue has a DEX of 15, for a +3 mod, and gets this Glyph, their new DEX score would be a 17, for a +4 mod. After each Long Rest, they make a DC8 DEX Save. 
* *Glyph of &lt;*spell&gt;: This Glyph functions similarly to a reusable spell scroll, in that the same etchings used to create a spell scroll are applied to one's skin. This allows the bearer to cast that spell, regardless of whether they could normally do so. The price to cast this spell is paid in blood: 1d8 per level of the spell. For this, Cantrips are considered to be 1st level spells.
   * E.g. To give your Monk the ability to cast Eldritch Blast, they can get this Glyph tattooed on their body, and take 1d8 damage for each casting of Eldritch Blast. ",1,Magic Tattoos
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,15,321,"# Conflict

Creating rich and deep worlds is a matter of taking your time and laying down some basic framework that will allow you to create depth, and not width. You can sprawl all you want, by creating tons of things, but if they are not well-designed or even well-contemplated, they will be shallow and worthless.

Depth, not width, is the watchword of the day. 

So how do you create depth?

My mentor DM taught me a phrase and I'm going to teach it to you. The phrase is, ""layers upon layers"". What this means is you need to always have many layered elements in your worldbuilding. 

For example, let's say you want to create a Merchant's Guild. They regulate the prices among the merchants, ensure that they don't get gouged from suppliers, trade contacts, share the load when prices fall and share the wealth when prices rise. Pretty standard stuff. Pretty boring too. You need depth. Conflict is the easiest and most basic way to create depth. There could be many, many rivalries within the Guild. Individuals vs individuals, individuals vs groups, groups vs groups, and so on. Some people could be in several different of these internal factions, working against more than one opponent. It can get messy really quickly, so don't go too overboard on your first attempt. 

I would suggest you add 3 conflicts to any of your organizations. Some examples of conflict could be:

* Monetary
* Power
* Religious belief
* Class differences
* Racial differences
* Philosophical differences
* Romantic
* Conspiracies

These aren't the only ideas of course, but they should get your mind ticking over about what you can do in your own games. 

Let's keep this example going, though. Let's add 3 conflicts to our Merchant's Guild. There are 8 choices in my list above, so lets roll 3d8 and see what we come up with. 

Power, Religious Belief, Monetary. Nice. Now let's flesh these out. 

**The Merchant Guild of Berenthal**

The guild is comprised mostly of wealthy humans, with a few demi-humans who have clawed their way up through the brutal economic environment of the trade hub of Berenthal. While they put on a united front in public, in reality the guild is fractured along racial lines, with the House of Greenleaf and Greymountain pitted against the other 6 Human Houses. The Elven and Dwarven factions, respectively, control most of the raw precious metals trade and this has given them a slowly-gaining edge over the other factions, and as a result, the Human factions have been plotting against them in secret, hiring assassins, and attempting to sabotage the production facilities high in the Bluestone Mountains. 

However, not is all brotherly love within the Human houses either. House Smithfield are staunch Yorgonites - followers of the God of Wealth, Gambling and Excess, and their naked greed for power has angered the other houses, who are mostly devout followers of Ikshil - God of Commerce and Trade, and these Houses have gone so far as to contact allies high in the Faith to assist them with crushing House Smithfield before their rampant excess brings them all down. The Temple of Ikshil has sent word to the Emperor, and soon a Royal Accountant will be visiting Berenthal, much to the glee of the faithful Houses. 

Within House Greymountain, the Dwarven collective is experiencing its own schism - the cost of minting currency for the government has spiked due to sabotage efforts from 3rd party provocateurs hired by the Human Houses, and there is fear that they will lose their contract and suffer massive income losses. To counter this, a small group of vocal merchants within the House has proposed that they start diluting the pure gold coins with copper, and save on production costs and overhead. The majority have shouted them down, however, citing ancient Dwarven traditions like Honor and Fair Play, but the vocal minority has argued that those will mean little if they are all destitute and gutter-bound!

---

So you can see with a few simple conflicts, this one single faction is suddenly a lot more interesting. There are lots of things at play, and each of those things ripples out into the world and touches other things. D&amp;D, like nature, is a web. Use it to your advantage. 

# Personalities

Much like organizations, individuals should have ""layers upon layers"" built into their personalities and life stories. NPCs can be created fairly quickly and then given a splash of depth by utilizing similar types of conflict in their lives as in the above illustration. A Human Fighter could have money problems, relationship problems, or problems with a co-adventurer/worker. All of these things add depth to the NPC beyond being a quest-dispenser or repeater-of-3-lines-of-dialogue. 

A quick and easy way to create an NPC is to use of the hundreds of random generators out there, available freely online. I tend to just do my own version by adding 3 traits to my NPCs. The traits are ""Calm"", ""Stressed"" and ""Afraid"", and these are the general attitude/behaviors they exhibit under the trait's condition. So for example, to our Fighter we add conflict and traits:

Tom Slashem

* Calm: Friendly, cheerful

* Stressed: Quick-to-anger

* Afraid: Suspicious and murderous

* Conflict: Owes 300 coins to the local rogues guild for gambling debts

* Conflict: Discovered his wife is cheating on him with his superior

* Conflict: In a bitter rivalry with another guardsman over watch assignments/rosters

That took about a minute, and already this guy is a thousand times more interesting than ""Fighter NPC"". 

You can add ""layers upon layers"" with NPCs that intertwine with other NPCs, or with the PCs themselves. If 2 NPCs work together in a tavern, there's a good chance they are interconnected somehow, either through conflicts or bonds. 

# Bonds

Conflict is not the only way to tie things together. Mutually-beneficial ""bonds"" are a great way of tying friendlies together instead of enemies. Bonds can utilize a similar list as the one mentioned in the Conflict section, and are a simple matter of choosing or rolling a few and taking a few minutes to write them down. 

Let's add some bonds to our Fighter and our Merchant Guild.

**Merchant Guild:**

* Bond: 3 members of the Guild believe that there is a conspiracy to devalue the currency (they are correct)

* Bond: The Guild has close ties with the Mages Guild, with whom they do a lot of business and contract out security forces

* Bond: All Guild members have to go through a secret initiation which is designed to foster friendship and cooperation

**Fighter:**


* Bond: Is good friends with a Captain in the Night Watch, both are from the same neighborhood

* Bond: Has a mutual crush on a married waitress, neither will act on their feelings, but they enjoy spending time together

* Bond: Belongs to a sect within the Fighters Guild that worships Triklamon, the God of Warfare, and has secret meetings

Now you have even more depth. We haven't added any more outside factions. We haven't sprawled into width, we've deepened, into depth.

These are simple things, but if you take the time to create a small list of ideas for yourself, you can quickly create layers upon layers of interesting worldbuilding that will resonate in your narratives in ways you cannot predict. *Magic.* 
 

# Talk is Cheap

One facet of information is that a lot of it is bullshit. Lies and half-truths abound in the real world, and so they should in your D&amp;D games. People lie all the time, about the stupidest things, and if you can get into the habit of lying to your PCs about things that both matter *and don't matter*, then you will be creating depth in your world that you cannot buy. Once the players understand that everyone has an agenda, and that nothing is black-and-white, then you will see your players change, and start to comprehend the idea that getting to know someone and using critical thinking is a lot more interesting than a cookie-cutter ""quest dispenser"". 

Lie to your party. Tell the truth when the NPC feels safe enough to do so, not upon meeting a stranger!

# Persistence is Key

A good method for worldbuilding is to be patient and persistent. A lot DMs like to change worlds every time they run a campaign, and that's a totally valid way of doing it, but it does seem like a lot of work. For me, I spent nearly 3 decades with the same world, and I just kept adding layers and layers to it. One of the side-effects of using the same world was this idea of persistence. When something happens, it changes something, and that thing remains until acted upon again. 

For example. If you have a party go into a dungeon, spring traps, make camps, kill monsters, and carve graffiti, when a second party goes through the same dungeon in a few (real-time) months or years, they can see the sprung traps, the skeletons, the old campfires, and the faded graffito. That is verisimilitude writ large. It creates a very solid and affirming idea in the players' minds that what they do matters. That they will be remembered, even if it is in death or dickbutts scratched into a dungeon wall. 

This can apply to many things. The key is to keep really good notes and make sure you track these changes. If you print out your fancy new dungeon, keep notes in the margins about what the party did here and use them when another party comes through. *Trust your past self to help out your future self*. 

If the world continually resets, or is retconned, or wiped away somehow, you are robbing your worlds of depth. Let the past inform the future. You'll thank me for it later.

# History Matters

Writing history for worldbuilding is an exercise in mental masturbation that we all indulge. Its very seductive to create rich and deep and sprawling history, but the the mistake a lot of DMs (and writers) make is that they then try to wordvomit these facts on to their parties. Their eyes glaze over as the DM starts to read from his extensive notes, and let's be honest, they don't care. I wouldn't care either, because its disconnected from who I am as a character. I want my history to be Shown and Not Told. If this is some ancient Elven forest, then describe it to me, don't tell me what the strange sigils are on the trees - let that be a mystery or at least part of some mythology. If you give me 3 paragraphs about what exactly they are, I'm going to be less invested because you just told me the truth of the matter, and when is history ever as clean and straight-forward as that?

History matters, but only when its part of the canvas upon which you paint. History can, indeed, give your worlds depth and ""life"", but not at the expense of player investment. The only time the player is going to care is when it affects their backstory. Go as nuts as you want having conversations about culture, beliefs, traditions, laws and the like of the faction the character belongs to, but don't ""info dump"" this on them during the game. 

History can be as involved with conflicts, bonds, and whatever else you want to use to connect it all together, and don't be afraid to write histories that might not necessarily be The Truth by whomever wrote it down. In fact, I would encourage you to do that. Sometimes the truth can never be known, and Mystery drives drama, and drama is why we play. 

---

To sum up, creating depth for your worlds and making things feel real is a matter of adding layers and layers to the basic frameworks you have put in place. Don't be afraid of going deep! Depth, not width, is what tricks the mind into believing the illusion. Good luck!

###***Introduction***

This is a small dungeon, designed to look like an ant nest. Note that this is a side-view of the colony (as though it were in an ant farm); this is not a top-down view. Up means up, it does not mean “north”.

Each square on the grid paper means 10 feet. The black lines indicate zones with very warm updrafts.

When I originally ran this dungeon with my players, I had a mix of Thri-Keen and giant ants inhabiting the tunnels. 

This dungeon is intended as stealth mission; get to the queen and kill her without triggering alarm responses from any of the workers or soldiers. This will require out-of-the-box thinking and subterfuge on the part of your players. If you’re running the dungeon as a stealth mission, I strongly suggest that you do something to make it very explicit that there are going to be severe consequences if the ants get angry. I suggest having an ant, covered in some kind of scented oil, attempt to enter the colony and get ripped apart by her sisters. 

You can also run this as a fierce battle through waves and waves of rottweiler-sized ants. Or a mix of stealth and slog-battle. Up to you.


#***Adventure Hooks***

- The players are hired by a local Lord to clear out the ants plaguing his peasants.

- A Myconid from a rival colony wants the players to infect The Queen with deadly spores.

- The players stumble upon the nest during an adventure in The Underdark.

- A crazy wizard wants the players to capture The Queen alive, and bring her to him.

- A group of bandits have somehow figured out how to use the ant nest as a safe place to hide out.

#***Myconids and Giant Ants***

Some giant ant colonies foster communities of myconids in their nests. These myconids enjoy the favor of a vicious collective of insectoid guardians, and in return, they tend to the vast mushroom gardens that keep the ant colony fed. Myconids also serve as apothecaries for The Colony; they are experts at applying different fungi towards disease prevention, and they often mix medicines in case of disease outbreak within The Colony. Symbiotic myconids will usually infect a few dozen workers with a slow progressing, but ultimately fatal, growth of myconid spores. This creation of a hybridized ant-myconid facilitates communication between the two communities, and also serves as a host for the next generation of myconids. For the ants, the occasional loss of workers is worth the service that they receive from the mushroom folk. However, Myconids are NEVER allowed to be in close contact with The Queen, or any ants from the breeder-caste. 

#***Castes***

When I ran this dungeon, I kept my ants very simple. They’re extremely instinct-driven animals that mainly respond to chemical stimuli (pheromones). I had three broad classes of ants; workers, soldier and breeders. You can, of course, go pretty crazy with this, and make many more subcastes. For the sake of my sanity however, let’s stick with three main castes, and just a few special sub-castes.

**Worker:** Roughly the size of a large dog. Generally will not attack players, unless provoked. Will voraciously eat mushrooms, sugary substances and anything bloody. If provoked, they will fight back. If injured, they will emit alarm and injury pheromone. If they find something that they consider to be food, they will emit swarm pheromone. The most numerous ant by far.

**Special Worker (Honeypot):** These are workers that have been overstuffed with food, and act as living food repositories. Their abdomens are grossly swollen; up to 5-6x the size of a normal worker ant. They are fairly helpless and unable to move as a result of their weight. Honeypots hang from the ceiling, and regurgitate liquid, sugary paste at the request of other ants. A single  honeypot usually has 2-6 soldiers nearby. Honeypots will explode if their abdomens are injured; this can be very dangerous for anyone that gets the sugar paste on them (Consider the area of effect like that of a *Fireball* spell).

**Special Worker (Fungal Worker):** These are workers that have been infected with Myconid reproductive spores. These spores grow very slowly, and allow the ant to perceive the Myconid spore-based communication, and facilitates cooperation between the Ant colony, and the Myconid tribe. When the reproductive spores inevitably take over all brain functions of this worker, it will seek out the colony’s Myconid allies. Within a few days, the worker’s body will shut down, and explode as several young myconids emerge from the corpse. Fungal workers can be distinguished by the fungal growths that poke out of their skin at irregular intervals. Fungal workers are NEVER allowed near The Queen.

**Soldier:** About 2x the size of a worker. Has very large, very sharp mandibles. She will attack anything that smells unfamiliar, or anything that smells like blood. If agitated, she will emit alarm pheromone fairly easily.

**Special Soldier (Bombardier):** The same size as all the other soldiers. However, its body contains a volatile mixture of chemicals that become very explosive if mixed. When attacking, the ant will turn her rear end toward the target, and hose the target down with a sticky, burning acid. Assign acid damage as you see fit, I recommend looking at the various black dragon breath weapons for ideas on how to scale the damage. If a bombardier is slain by fire, piercing, or acid damage, her body should explode in a shower of indiscriminate acid. Bombardiers are uncommon, and should NEVER be seen near The Queen, or near honeypots. Bombardiers smell faintly of sulphur.

**Breeders:** Slightly smaller than a worker, and has wings. Will flee from anything that presents a threat. If attacked, they will try to escape and emit copious amounts of alarm pheromone. These are the only ants that are potentially male.

**Special Breeder (Queen):** The Queen is about 5x the size of a worker ant, or about the size of a horse. The Queen is fairly immobile, and is usually surrounded by a small swarm of workers and soldiers. She is constantly laying eggs and eating. If The Queen emits alarm pheromone, her workers will form a tight ball around her, with their mandibles facing out towards the threat. Meanwhile, her soldiers will become extremely aggressive.

##***Pheromones***

Pheromones are how the ants communicate. We can get almost as complex as we want with pheromones, but I decided to just stick to a few basic pheromones/messages that the ants may want to send to each other while your players are invading their nest.

**Alarm Pheromone:** This is what the ants emit when they are scared, or highly agitated. The scent of alarm will send any nearby soldiers into an aggressive frenzy until the threat is dealt with. Woe be to any players that get caught up in a cloud of alarm pheromone. Alarm pheromone is a sharp, stinging scent that lingers for quite some time. 

**Food Pheromone:** This is a pheromone emitted by workers that have found food. It is a call for other workers to come and help the worker tear apart whatever has been found, and drag it away to the nest. Food pheromone is a soft, musky scent that does not linger very long. 

**Home Pheromone:** This pheromone is emitted constantly by all members of the same colony. This pheromone is how ants identify those who belong, and those who do not. The subtleties of ‘home pheromone’ are lost on non-insectoid characters; it mostly smells like vinegar.

**Injury Pheromone:** Any injured ant will emit this smell. Soldiers will become very agitated when they sense it; workers will usually attempt to tear the injured ant apart and drag it to the trash heap. The exception to this is when The Queen is injured. Injuries to The Queen will cause workers to repeatedly lick her wounds, and attempt to seal them with salves made of pulp, saliva and earth. Injury pheromone is metallic-acidic smell that lingers.

**Royal Pheromone:** This pheromone is constantly emitted by The Queen. Soldiers in the vicinity of The Queen will be alert and very active. They will repeatedly run their antennae over any individuals near The Queen, to make sure that they smell like friendlies. Workers in the vicinity of royal pheromone are highly active, seeking something to feed or clean. Royal pheromone smells like damp mushrooms. 

**Swarm Pheromone:** This is a pheromone that is emitted by workers when they want other workers to follow them, or come check out what they have found. A more abstract interpretation of this pheromone would be that it is an expression of curiosity. Swarm pheromone is a very subtle, rank smell and does not linger very long.

#***The Colony***


**Upper Layer**
These rooms are considered fairly “low-security”. Soldiers will be relaxed, tired and generally inattentive, if your players do not cause too much trouble. 

**Entrance A**

From the surface, entrance A will look like a series of badger-hole sized openings in the earth. Hot, stale air with a vinegar-like smell will be blowing up out of the holes. These are vents that are specifically designed to allow heat to escape the warmer depths of the colony. If the players attempt to dig (or move earth) down through this area, they may create a small sinkhole and find themselves tumbling down into the nest. 

**Entrance B**
Entrance B should look like a very typical ant mound kind of entrance. However, if your players decide to enter from this side, they should be very careful, as there is a 160-foot drop down this entrance. The gravel that comprises the mound around this entrance should be very loose, and it will not offer much in the way of “grip” for pitons and rope. A steady stream of workers and soldiers should be going to and from from this entrance.

**Entrance C**
This entrance also comprises of a classic ant hill mound made of loose gravel. The tunnel leading down here is slightly curved, and offers the easiest ingress to your players. HOwever, this is the most highly trafficked entrance. Workers and soldiers will constantly be coming and going. Every so often, soldier ants will “scan” passers-by with their antennae to make sure they smell friendly. Entrance C immediately leads to the Worker Barracks, and to the tunnel that leads to the “Shroom Room”.

**Worker Barracks**

This should be the first major room that your players stumble their way into. It is a very large, expansive room where workers and soldiers will rest when they are inbetween jobs for the colony. Honeypots hang upside-down from the the ceiling in this room (their mouths face the floor). Hungry workers will climb on the walls and ceilings to tend to the honeypots, and get sugary paste from them. This is a very busy room, with many ants going to and fro; it can be considered “low security”, and even soldiers present here will not be on guard (unless your players begin upsetting the Honeypots).

A large tunnel in the floor of this room will lead down to larvae room 2. At the far end of this room is a series of large, undesignated rooms that are multipurpose. Tunnels leading down to the egg room and larvae room 1 can be found in these undesignated areas.

**Multipurpose Rooms**

These are the two rooms directly beneath entrances A and B. The room near entrance A is stiflingly hot, and dry. Room A might be a place where the ants dry out meat, or otherwise utilize the heat that is being vented out of the egg room. Room B is simply a mass gathering room where the ants communicate with each other (via pheromones) before heading out to seek food, water or other resources. Room B is also where food is distributed by workers returning from a find. This room should be should be crowded and smelly.


**Middle Layer**

Security increases here, especially in the Egg Room, and heading towards The Queen’s chamber. Soldiers will be slightly more willing to start alarming in these higher security areas.

**Heat Vent**

This is a long tunnel that leads straight down from Room A into the Egg Room. The Ants sometimes block this tunnel with collections of debris, and mulchy-paper-saliva glue so that the egg room can be warmed. Usually, the tunnel is open, and gusts of hot, damp air blow up this tunnel and out of Entrance A. Your players may attempt to climb down this tunnel, but it may be difficult if the updrafts are particularly strong. They may also find that the tunnel is blocked with logs, branches and insect paper. Unless workers are actively working to block or unblock this tunnel, it should be free of ants.

**Larvae Room 1**

This room, like the egg room, is kept very warm, but the temperature is not as highly regulated as the egg room.

In this room, hundreds of larvae squirm about on the ground, or in alcoves in the wall. Workers bustle about the room, feeding the increasingly hungry larvae, and eating the cast-off pupae that the larvae leave behind. Depending upon the different foods and pheromones that these larvae are exposed to, they will develop into a different specialized caste. Once the larvae are about the size of a small dog, and have begun their final pupation, the workers will take them to Larvae Room 2.

**Larvae Room 2**

In this room, ant pupae are stacked wall-to-wall, awaiting the emergence of the final, adult form of the young ants. This room is filled with a damp, earthy smell coming up from the “Shroom Room”. Young worker ants that only recently pupated will be put to work in the shroom room. This is a fairly low-security room; soldiers do seem to care very much about what is going on in this room. However, the players may encounter recently pupated soldiers who edgy, and not particularly well socialized.

**Shroom Room**

This is one of the more expansive rooms in the colony (z-axis people!). In this room, the ants cultivate a small forest of mushrooms to keep the colony fed. The entire floor of this room is a mix of compost, which fosters the growth of favorable fungi. If you are so inclined, you may populate this room with a small tribe of myconids that are living in a symbiotic relationship with The Ants. If there are myconids in this room, there should also be several “fungal workers”, in various states of growth progression. The Myconids will not be hostile to the players, unless they percieve the players to be a threat to the colony. If a threat to the colony is perceived, the Myconids will attempt to halt the players at all costs. It should be noted that the Myconids and the Ants are incapable of direct communication without the help of a fungal worker. There is large hole in the “Shroom Room” that leads to the colony’s trash heap. There are dozens of vents that allow warm air to flow out from The Queen’s Chamber into the Shroom Room; these vents are small enough that only a “Small” or smaller creature might fit.

*Variant:* You might have a faction within the Myconids that wish to be free from the rule of The Ants. They may aid your players into reaching The Queen. 


**Lower Layer**

The Trash Heap, Egg Room and The Queen’s Chamber are down here. Nobody cares what goes in/out of The Trash Heap, but the Egg Room, and The Queen’s Chamber are the highest security areas of the colony. Players should expect vigilance and apprehension from the soldiers here.

**Trash Heap**

This room is a gigantic pile of refuse, offal and discarded ant corpses. It is extremely low-security. It may be inhabited by injured/dying ants, oozes, or fungal ants that have become infectious, sterile and aberrant. Depending upon the CR level that you wish to run, this refuse heap may be inhabited by a Roper, Nothic or other cave-dwelling aberration. There should be no healthy ants inside the trash heap, but streams of workers on their way to deposit trash may be found.

**Egg Room**

This is the room where newly-laid eggs are incubated. Clusters of football-sized eggs are glued to the walls, floor and ceiling by ant saliva. This room is swarming with workers who clean the eggs and tend to compost heaps that generate heat to warm the room. The ants are very particular about regulating the temperature of this room, so as to foster optimal egg growth. There is a very large vent-tunnel in this room, that is occasionally blocked with debris, or held open, to adjust the temperature of the room. Soldiers in this area would be highly suspicious of anyone who approaches a cluster of eggs. When an egg gets close to hatching, workers will take it into Larvae Room 1. Because this room is so close to the Queen’s Chamber, soldiers will be somewhat on-edge in this room. If players approach the tunnel leading towards The Queen’s Chamber, the soldiers may become agitated and very curious about what the players are up to.

**Thri-Kreen Tunnel**

In the game I originally ran with this dungeon, this tunnel was home to a Thri-Kreen raiding party that was hiding out in the ant colony. However, if you wish to just run a straight-up ant colony, then this tunnel should be packed with Soldiers. It is extremely high-security, and they will not allow anyone to enter The Queen’s Chamber if they do not smell like a worker. Additionally, if the players have any lingering scents of Myconid on them, the soldiers will become highly agitated, as Myconids are NOT allowed near The Queen. There should be a steady stream of workers carrying food into The Queen’s Chamber, and eggs out of the chamber.

**The Queen’s Chamber**

This is the room where The Queen is kept. This room is kept very clean, so as to minimize infectious agents near The Queen. Workers and soldiers constantly swarm The Queen, cleaning her, feeding her and carrying away the eggs that she is constantly laying. The swarm of activity keeps this room very warm, which is why the walls are pockmarked with vents that lead into the Shroom Room. Soldiers in this room will constantly scan workers (and the players) with their antennae, and attack anything that smells amiss.",1,Giant Ant Colony - A dungeon for any level!
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,11,73,"I have made an Arcane Weather effect for an upcoming campaign I'm running and thought I would share it here. It can be pretty brutal, which is intended. I also drew inspiration from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/89kjis/arcane_weather/) awesome post, so thank you to those great authors too.

Roll 2d100 to calculate the effects of an Arcane Storm. On a repeated result, double the strength and duration of the effect.

Every time the creature finishes a long rest they must make a second DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a part of their body becomes paralyzed. Once they have failed 5 saving throws, including the initial save, their entire body becomes paralyzed. A Lesser Restoration or Cure Disease spell halts the progress or Rot, but does not cure it. A Greater Restoration spell or an ancient herbal remedy are the only known cures.

If a creature replaces the temporary hit points with temporary hit points of another source, they are treated as having used all of the temporary hit points.
46. **Blinding Fog.** A thick black fog creeps through as this gale passes overhead. The fog is heavier than air, and easily pours beneath the earth into unprotected caves and cellars alike. Any creature that the fog touches must make DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded. The effect lasts for 1d4 days, however if a creature rolls a natural 1 on their saving throw the effect is permanent.
47. **Sleep.** The wind of this storm tempest carry gentle music atop them, imperceptible to anyone not attuned to the ethereal plane. All creatures caught in the storm must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be overcome with exhaustion. Affected creatures gain one level of exhaustion, and must repeat their saving throw after one minute. On a second failure, the creature falls Unconscious for 4d10 hours. Unconscious creatures cannot be woken by regular means and require a Lesser Restoration spell, or similar effect, to rouse them. Creatures that cannot be put to sleep, or cannot be put to sleep by magical means are immune to this effect.
48. **Entomb.** The wind carries crystal dust upon it which seek out any living creatures. Creatures caught in the storm must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw each minute or have their movement reduced by 10 feet. If a creature's movement speed is reduced to 0, they are entirely encased in the crystalline substance and are considered Petrified. This effect lasts for 2d8 hours as the crystal substance gradually returns to dust.
49. **Deluge.** While any storm can carry with it the threat of flooding, these storms create cyclones in their paths. The storm generates 6d4 cyclones, each of which wrecks havoc as it moves slowly across the land. Creatures within 50 feet of the cyclone must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and be pulled into the cyclone. Creatures that succeed on their saving throws take half damage and are not pulled into the watery vortex. Creatures within the vortex take 4d8 bludgeoning damage each round, and can reroll their Strength saving throw at disadvantage at the end of each round. Additionally, water covers the landscape and rises by 1d4 feet per hour.

Creatures in the area are bathed in bright, white light and must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw each minute. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 radiant damage and is stunned. Stunned creatures can repeat their saving throws with disadvantage at the end of each round. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not stunned.

Creatures caught in the storm must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw each minute, taking 4d4 bludgeoning damage on a failure or half as much on a success. The pearls contain the memories of those who have died in past storms. If a creature uses an action to consume the pearl, they gain a significant memory from the life of a random fallen creature. The memory is of a significant event in that creature's life and lasts no longer than 5 minutes. Pearls that are not consumed melt into the earth in 2d4 hours, causing life to sprout in their place.

# The Avenger

Druids who have seen great trauma done to the wilderness will sometimes harden their hearts and become Avengers. They are a grim folk, who rarely speak unless necessary, and never explain their actions to others. 

Avengers do not take the traditional ""defensive"" mindset of most Druids. While others are slow and contemplative, loathe to act too hastily for fear of upsetting the Balance, the Avenger makes their decisions ""within the space of seven breaths"" and lets the rest of the Order pick up the pieces. 

Avengers utilize all their powers to wage war on those who would wage war upon the wilderness and all its gifts. There is no strategy or tactic they will not consider. They show their enemies no quarter. They are the fury of Nature, personified.

Avengers do not make friends, although they will work with temporary allies to achieve a goal if the Druid's goals are also advanced. They are poor collaborators, however, choosing to go their own way, regardless of the advice or strategies of others. This makes the Avenger a liability at times, but more often than not, the Avenger's methods are effective and their leadership decisions are sound. 

Beasts and Plants are but another tool in the Avenger's arsenals. While they have extreme respect for them, in the end the Avenger's righteous crusades make life and decisions easy, regardless of the being's place in the Balance. This makes Avenger's hard to trust sometimes, and they have been formally sanctioned by the Grand Druid on countless occassions for their recklessness and callous attitude, but until you have seen the fire-scorched remains of thousands of acres of virgin forest, the floor lumped with the blackened shapes of countless creatures, who can judge an Avenger's motivations?

Avengers will often be seen among armed groups, from Royal Armies to village posses, and they will almost always been in a position of leadership, or at the right hand of someone who is. Their force of will and charisma are hard to resist - such do they burn with righteous force.

Most often though, Avengers work solo. They are the D&amp;D version of the true eco-terrorists, fighting a war on behalf of nature itself. They Avenger is ruthless and single-minded, and prone to holding grudges. They have no problem with destroying an entire village or expedition if the people ignore the Avenger's warnings. 

Usually an Avenger will publicly denounce the wrongdoers and give them a chance to stop their activities. If that fails, then the transgressors begin to disappear or are publicly displayed after their violent deaths. If this fails, then the Avenger declares War and will wipe out the entire contigent and encourage nature to reclaim the area and restore the Balance. 

In truth, Avengers rarely restore any kind of Balance. They are a chaotic sect within the Druid philosophy and large amounts of time and resources are spent cleaning up after their campaigns.

# Plot Hooks

* The village where the party is staying is challenged by an Avenger, who denounces them for overfishing and overhunting. The Avenger says this is their last warning and vanishes into the night. In the next few days the villagers start disappearing.
* An Avenger approaches the party and says that she sees they are heading through (terrain) and requests their help with clearing out a den of monsters. She will run off to execute the plan as soon as it is formed, and refuses to wait.
* The party comes across an Avenger burning the crop fields of a local village. The Avenger, if asked, says that these fields are proscribed and cannot be farmed, as per the ancient Compact. If threatened, the Avenger will flee, only to return and carry on their arsonist activities the next day.
* The party stumbles across a fresh battlefield. An Avenger is walking through the field, dispatching the mortally-wounded with a dagger slash to the throat. There are hundreds of dead here, and dozens of wounded crying out in pain. A murder of crows watches from a nearby tree.
* The party discovers a local hamlet (a village with orchards) under siege by an Avenger and a pack of wild animals that appear to be under its control. The animals are savaging anyone caught in the streets, and trying to break into the locked and shuttered houses. The Avenger is purging this hamlet for defying his orders to stop logging the nearby forest.
* An Avenger and 3 brown bears confront the party while they are camped and says that open flames are forbidden here, since there has not been a burn-off in 3 years. If challenged, the Avenger will order the bears to attack and being casting.

# BTS tell me about the shops found in the City of Gandahar!",1,The City of Gandahar: Shops Megathread
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,15,57,"The language system in D&amp;D has a long and storied history, which I will not go into here, but know that incorporating them into the game has always been a bit clunky. Simulating a real language in game is difficult, at best, and there have been myriad methods, strategies and discussions around how best to implement them. 

Unless you are multi-lingual, there is no immersive way that doesn't feel cheap and meta, that's been my experience, anyway, and I've seen a good 2 dozen DMs try, struggle, and ultimately fail to do it effectively - this includes myself. 

What I like to do, instead, is have language inform my worldbuilding. 

# Tongues &amp; Dialects

Mother tongues are the base language for each race. Humans speak Common, Elves speak some form of base Elvish, and so on. Monsters can be included in this if you want to get granular and have racial tongues for them, or they can be grouped loosely into categories and have a common tongue that covers the category (e.g., beasts, fey, constructs, etc...)

When a speaker of one tongue meets a speaker of a different tongue and if the language is common for the area, then they recognize what the language is, but they cannot understand one another. Period. You are either fluent in the language or you are not. No ""half-understandings"". No halting words in a simulated ignorance - ""you come go now"". That's where you fall into the swamp. Don't do it. Make it binary. Yes or no. 

The party may know that the mysterious stranger is speaking Low Elvish, for instance, but no clue what they are saying. The reverse would be true for the Elf if the party was speaking Common. 

If the language is not common to the area, then there is no information given. Its just ""a foreign tongue"" (tongue being loosely used here). 

You can break your tongues into Dialects, which are individual changes to the vernacular and lexicon based on region, belief, or some other individual identity. 

For example, in a huge trade city, there may be a Common dialect among the people in the Dock District, or among the nobles, or people who live near the garbage dump. Individual clans of Gnomes out in wilds may have Gnomish clan dialects. These are still considered tongues, but they give you a bit more depth in identifying where the speaker is from. 

That's where the worldbuilding I mentioned comes into play. Language tells you a lot about a person's background and heritage (usually). Its true, that many people speak multiple languages in D&amp;D, but its safe to assume a Dwarf will speak Dwarven, or some dialect, and that the Dwarves generally live on X continent in the X mountains (or wherever). 

This is a sneaky way of info-dumping on your party. Say the party are locals, but have never met a Dwarf, personally, although they interact with them, and have heard them speak. 

One day they meet a peddler, a Mountain Dwarf, and the Fighter in the party is a Hill Dwarf, or a well-spoken Human that knows Dwarven. The peddler speaks in ""Rocklan"", a Dwarven dialect particular to his clan's part of the Big Mountains range. Both party members would recognize the language, and be able to speak and understand it, but they also get some worldbuilding info along the way. You tell them that they recognize the dialect and do a quick dump and proceed with the scene. Sneaky eh?!

# Cants

A cant (or argot) is a secret language, usually associated with religion, like Druids or Clerics or secret or illegal organizations, like Rogues, or class-based organizations, like Rangers. 

Cants allow individuals that understand it to speak in complete obscurity, when an observer that does not speak the cant is present. Its a foolproof code, and cannot be broken, including magical means (Comprehend Languages, for example). 

Cants can also inform worldbuilding, by identifying members of a group. For example, if the party Mage is having a drink and hears two shady looking characters speaking ""gibberish"", he knows that they must be speaking Theives Cant, but cannot understand a word they say. You could info dump here, giving a bit of information about what little the locals know about the Guild. 

The thing to remember about Cants is that they sound like regular speech, they are just in code, and without knowing the code analogues, its impossible to decipher. 

If you want to see a great example of actually use Theives Cant in-game, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8k8g8k/oh_yes_thieves_can_cant/) by /u/DreadClericWesley (a long time BTS citizen).

Cants, remember, are secret languages, and the translations are closely guarded, and will change over time as the culture evolves. 

Cants can be used for any organization that wants its members to be able to communicate without being eavesdropped - since the Cant is a code, magical means like Comprehend Languages will not work on them. 

# Pidgins and Jargon 

Pidgins (or patois) are crude forms of language between two people that do not share a common tongue. A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from a multitude of languages as well as onomatopoeia. The lexicon of any pidgin will be limited to core vocabulary. 

These types of languages usually arise around trade, since there is a common need to understand one another for commerce. This is the only time you should ever try and simulate a language at the table. This is when you use the ""caveman talk"", and it should be used very sparingly, and among groups that share a common area but have vastly different cultures that would not facilitate contact except to foster trade. An example would be a tribe of Duergar who come to the surface to trade minerals for fresh beef from the human cattle farms.

Comprehend language will work on Pidgins, since a ""third"" language is being created. 

Jargon is specialized language in a tongue that people of the same profession, usually, use to ""talk shop"". Two rangers talking trailcraft might be speaking common, but the listener might not understand due to context and slang. An apt example would be two people discussing a D&amp;D combat scene while a non-gamer listens in. Hearing words like ""initiative, AC, HP, Dex saves"" and the like is not going to be understood. The gist of the activity might be able to be gleaned, but not its exact meaning.

If a player hears someone speaking Jargon, they will be able to recognize what the person's occupation is, most likely (except in the rarest of cases), but be unable to discern any meaning from it. Like cants, Comprehend Language does not work on Jargon.

All these examples are ways for your party to identify people who are speaking these things, and can be used to foster mystery if two individuals are speaking softly in Druidic Cant in a crowded pub, for example. Languages are designed to foster questions in the listener's mind. ""What are they saying? Who are they? Why are they here?"" 

You cannot buy interest like that, and the nice thing is, its built into the very concept of language. Mystery creates interest which leads to drama, n'est pas? Always a good thing. 

See you next time!",1,"Languages: Tongues, Dialects, Cants, Pidgins and Jargon"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,89,844,"Major DND benchmarks can be obtaining one's first magical weapon, teleporting the party, tooling over an entire adventure with Wind Walk and making half the party look like sideshow clowns when the first +3 Greatsword enters the mix. 

&amp;nbsp;

Magic Items are a core part of the game and many classes are balanced around them. Most fighters are unable to pick a high level monster's nose without a magic weapon in hand. Many magic items come in the form of generic boosters that should be used in all situations. The 20th level Paladin is gonna whip out Excalibur to settle a brawl, friendly duel or scalp a giant rat because why not. Rocking a +X item is part of him and there's no reason not to use it. Nobody is awed or surprised when he uses it because it has unlimited charges and is a default part of his character. 

&amp;nbsp;


Now instead let's give the Paladin a conditional weapon. Something that is limited by the situation it can be used in, charges of ammunition or presenting threats and tradeoffs when used. When they pull out their Divine Double Barrel Shotgun for which only 3 rounds exist, or the sword that takes off 10% of your maximum life span whenever you swing it, or a weighing scale that can discern the truth of any lie told by anyone once before they break in half then! Then there is a little more gravitas. We can also make power budgets much more interesting. A Magical Staff that can cast 9th level Spells but every time you cast it time re-adjusts itself to ensure that you never meet a loved one can actually be as strong as a Staff of Fireballs since it will be more potent but used more rarely. 

&amp;nbsp;


When you design or select boons for your players focus instead on choice than on flat power. Think about giving them unique new options, not just making them incrementally better at what they do normally.

I'll round this out with some examples of Conditional, Ammunition, Perilous and moral elements that can allow you to still give your players fun gamebreaking shit while also keeping power creep in check and keeping special powers special. 

Conditional Item: *The Silver Forked Tongue* Allows you to speak one and only one lie to each Greater Devil of any power level you meet and they will believe it.

So in some campaigns and situations this is totally busted and will break open your campaign, but there are layers to it. Your Campaign could only have one or two of these entities, they could be incredibly difficult to access, they may be aware of this item and become wary of it, or even capture a player and have them used it in an enclosed environment to waste their one chance. Players might be more receptive to cool story lines if they involve diplomacy with Devils because they can use this cool item. You could argue that this takes power away from Deception focused characters but on the other hand this item is the apex of that type of play where you can commit a hilarious or unprecedented act of trickery that thinks along the Deception focused line that character would love.

&amp;nbsp;
 
As a DM you could make this item easy or hard to use. Graazt could give them an audience as a casual greeting or they could have to wade through hordes of monstrosities to reach a creature this would apply to. It gives the DM and players options and freedom of choice without just straightforward buffing them. This is an option that the whole party can enjoy using and is far more powerful when used in its specific niche way than the +2 Wand of the War Mage you were going to give them instead. 

Ammunition: *The Dead End Sawed Off* +3 Weapon 1d20 Damage Dice 120/120 range and allows you to for free use a WeaponMaster Maneuver with a d12 as the relevant die. 

Honestly you can make this shit as busted as you like because you're gating it's uses. You can have it only run off of extremely rare ammunition, or have it be a brittle and worn weapon that will fall apart after X uses. The main objective is to have a weapon that is amazing and feels good, but is only brought out for special occassions. Nobody is womping on rats with this thing when they had to pull their last three cartridges out of Jubilex's gall bladder. Your players will be faced with real decisions using this thing. Is a victory really worth using their vital weapon? Would they rather throw this fight than use their ultimate weapon? Adding shit that doesn't just recharge when they spend a few hours wittling in a portable mansion will add a lot of drama, decisionmaking and strategy to your campaign.

&amp;nbsp;

Perilous Item: *The Portable Road to All and Every*: Can cast the Teleport Spell once per long rest but it can target up to 30 creatures. Regardless of the location and it's relevant barriers, protections and wards the spell cannot fail or be prevented and mishaps can only occur on 96-97-98-99-100 of your D100 Roll. However if a Mishap does occur the party will be isolated in a pocket dimension and forced to fight the Horrible Eldritch CR 23 God Between the Cracks to the death before they can leave.


&amp;nbsp;

Teleportion can really derail a campaign and troll a DM so here we can add this fun caveat. Odds are your players are never going to roll the horrible situation but they probably won't use this item willy nilly. However this also gives them a choice. Do they risk being erased from reality to escape a pack of rust monsters? Are they willing to trust fate and put their lives in the hands of the dice? When they become powerful enough to fight this enemy do they use the item willy nilly? Do they still risk it when they are somewhat injured?  This one is very weird and very extreme. Many players and DMs won't want to risk their long running campaign on a 5% TPK chance but it might scratch an itch for some people. You can have all kinds of variations of this. It might queue up a horrible ghost they'll have to fight before they rest or it might reduce their luck or threaten them with a horrible curse. It might tax the party a portion of their HP or just punch them in the face with a bigass clockwork hand. 

Moral: *The Monster Masher*: Taking one action point this wand at a creature between CR 5 and 15. The monster must make an Intelligence Saving throw of 15. If it fails the monster dies and three exact copies of the monster are created and sent to random locations.

This is a pretty indirect example. The Froghemoths they bounce around could get eaten by bigger monsters, fall into volcanos or wipe out several different villages. You could make these more dramatic by directly hurting the world or the people. This is definitely the most risky and problematic method but it can reap some great and dramatic rewards.

By expanding on options for your players you can give them more room to grow, more objectives to play around and more rope to skip or hang themselves with. See how much more excited your players get about morally dubious and obviously dangerous new items and see how you can expand choice and potential, create more cinematic moments and highlight the strengths of your players without egregious overshadowing by supporting Power Choice instead of Power Creep!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,48,"While the meaning of Linjenwood lies in its very name, few know of its true purpose and origin. Mostly due to the fact that reaching it alive is a feat on its own. The ""woods"" begin as you near the very center of [""The Eye""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9jmi1c/where_giants_come_to_die_the_eye/), the land of dying giants.  From a distance, one could mistake it for a dead forest, though at a closer look, it becomes clear that not a single tree had set its roots in this deadland.

&amp;#x200B;

Thousands of towering trunks stand at a distance from one another, all bare, most without a single branch. Instead, they are ridden with cracks, metal and wood reinforcements, shield-sized iron studs and dried bloodstains. These are old and battle-worn weapons - clubs, maces and mauls. It's quite clear, that they're meant for no other than giants.

&amp;#x200B;

At the very center of the Linjenwood lays a ravine, where giants come to die. In their final piligrimage, they bring along their weapon, so that it may take its rightful place and be used again in the ages to come. As one ventures deeper, finer arms begin to appear - spears, axes, warhammers, swords. The [Ordnung](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ordning_(social_structure)) dictates how close to the center you may place your weapon. Of course, extraordinary hill giants might have earned a place near the center, while dishonorable cloud giants may find their heritage left at the far edges, forever soiling their name.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole process is guided by ogre shamans that dedicate their entire lives to memorize vast patches of the ""forest"". They know the name and the story behind every weapon. They pass judgement when a new weapon is to be placed or an old one relocated. They take charge when a giant that has come of age visits the Linjewood for the first time. The ogres find them a proper weapon, and with it - their name, for each weapon holds the name of its first bearer, which is passed on until the end of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Finding ones name and weapon is perhaps the most formative moment of a giant's life. They usually make the journey after a certain rite of passage, varying on where they hail from. They may take up a sword of grand lineage and forever live in glory, or get a lowly club and be consigned to a burdened fate.

&amp;#x200B;

* No two giants of the same name may live at once.
* Each weapon has a unique name engraved into it. Usually in giant or dwarvish, though there's always deviations.
* If a giant kills another giant, they may take their weapon and name. It is also highly honorable to take their corpse to The Eye.
* Ogre shamans know the name and story of every weapon in their assigned region. Most likely know of other regions as well.
* Ogre shamans live off donated goods from dying giants or piligrims, they work as the electors, lorekeepers and weapon-upkeepers of the Linjenwood.
* A giant tells his story or has his story told when it comes to die. This decides whether the weapon stays in place or moves up/down in the order.
* A new weapon is seldom made and competition for a new, untarnished name is fierce.

&amp;#x200B;",1,Linjenwood - The forest of Battle
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,40,567,"Many years ago, a group of mages devised a way to imbue food with magic, creating a magical jam that tasted really well and had powerful magical effects. Their organization produced and sold their jams all over the world and the planes, rapidly becoming one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the universe, their recipes a closely guarded secret.

Kingdoms fell and rose with a word, wars were fought and legends created, at the direction of those mages. The wealth they amassed was rivalled only by the greatest archfiends and oldest dragons. 

Their magical jam was called **Spelljam** and the people creating them **The** **Spelljammers**

But with power came enemies, and in the end, the Spelljammers were destroyed by a coalition of forces from all over the planes. The spelljam factories destroyed, and the secret recipes lost in the chaos.

Lost, but not forgotten. Today, centuries later, many people still look for the lost recipes. Owning even a single one, becoming a new Spelljammer, could bring immense wealth and power to anyone.

There are 8 recipes, one for each school of magic, each with different powers, taste and value. 

-----------------------------

 **Finding a recipe**

It's no easy task: the recipes have travelled all over the universe, some buried in forgotten ruins, other hidden in a dragon's hoard. They could be in a secure vault, or at the bottom of the ocean carved into the bones of a dead Leviathan. They could be hidden by a family that has passed it down from a generation to the next, or in the hands of a great demon willing to sell it to the highest bidder. Finding a recipe should be an adventure in itself.

And perhaps someone else has already found one and begun producing it. 

-------------------------------------


**Creating the spelljam**

The ingredient of a Spelljam are fruits, sugar, water, a number of herbs depending on the type of jam being made. The jam requires a number of arcane components and a magical circle, then a spell of the correct type needs to be cast every day during the preparation process. The spell energy is absorbed by the jam, so it doesn't do anything.

The exact procedure changes for each Spelljam.

The spell needs to be of at least level 3, weaker spells don't have enough power to give to the jam and will create a tasty but non-magical paste of little value.

Higher level spells will produce tastier jam.

Level 9 spells add special effects to the jam, creating what's known as a ""True Spelljam"", these are extremely rare and their taste is divine, the few that tried them were barely able to describe it, crying in joy or laughing uncontrollably. 

-------------------------------------

**Consuming the Spelljam**

A portion of Spelljam can fill a small bowl, and be eaten easily by any person. The magical effect acts without requiring any check. Spelljam never spoils naturally, but can be ruined if exposed to powerful magical energies. 

Eating more than one serving of spelljam is dangerous: one must wait before the effect of the magic is over, or they risk an overdose.

If one tries to eat more than one serving, they must pass a **DC 20 constitution check**. In case of failure they will puke all the jam, lose its effect, and gain one level of exhaustion for the next 24 hours. While sick they are also unable to eat more. Attempting to eat more will just cause them to puke with no effect, wasting the jam.

If one passes the skill check, they gain the effect of both jams.

If one then tries to eat a third, fourth or more portions, the DC grows by 10 for each attempt, and so do the levels of exhaustion gained in case of failure 

(**Example**: If one eats 4 spelljams, they'll have to pass a DC 20  a DC 30 and a DC 40 check, and gain 1, exhaustion if they fail the first, 2 if they fail the second and 3 the third.)
  
-------------------------------------


**The 8 Spelljams**

Each spelljam has a description of its taste, with the testimony of someone that ate a portion of it. 

A list of ingredients (for one serving), a preparation time, an effect and a special effect when a 9th level spell is used, plus a location where it can be found.

These recipes are lost, so many of their details are unknown and will be left to each DM imagination. This list just wants to give a few examples.

**WARNING**: some of these effects may be stupidly imbalanced, I just did whatever seemed flavourful, feel free to change or disregard anything seems too much or too little, I'm well aware they are nowhere near balanced.

- **Abjuration**

*Bit embarrassing to say, but... it felt like I was being hugged by me mum, felt like everything was ok and all the bad in the world was gonna go away, just felt like curling up and sleeping while sucking me thumb. God I'd kill to have more.* - Barolon Marbleshield, Dwarf Noble.

**Look and taste**: The magic of protection, it's a thick light-blue jam, cold to the touch. When eaten, it gives a warm and cosy feeling that spreads all over the body, and the sensation that everything will be alright. It was a very popular jam.


**Ingredients**: Water; Sugar; Cantaloupe; Hydrangea flowers that grew around a nursery;  a tear of happiness. Pearl Dust.

**Preparation Time:** 1 week.

**Effect**: For 24 hours, +2 to AC and advantage on all saving throws.

**Location**: Unknown.
_____________________

- **Conjuration**

*No known description of its taste*

**Look and taste**: A jar of conjuration spelljam is empty. When mimicking the act of eating from it, the jam will appear in one stomach. It has never been tasted and isn't clear if it's possible to do so. Never was a popular jam.

**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, five of any fruit but collected in five different plantations. Wolf hair, gryphon feathers, 1 gemstone that has been teleported at least 3 times. 

**Preparation Time:** 1 week, but the spelljam will disappear during the process, meaning the Spelljammer must mimic the preparation, pretending the jam is still there. Very hard to make. 

**Effect**: Unknown

**True Spelljam effect**: Unknown

**Location**: It is said the recipe will appear if someone just calls for it in the right location. Some say it's a certain mountain in the astral plane, others of a busy market in the underworld.

- **Divination** 

*I felt the stew my grandma used to make, but it also had a bit of the broth I had to eat when I was in college, it tasted like this morning breakfast and then, it was really weird, I felt the taste of a stake and a soup and a fried eel they make in 3 different places in Waterdeep, but I've never been there, I'll go to Waterdeep next year. How do I know what I'll eat there? I don't know how, but I know.* - Jimbo Hhappyfoot, halfling merchant.

**Look and taste**: Transparent liquid, similar to water, when looking at it directly. If looking with the corner of your eye you could see any colour or shape. It tastes like everything you've ever tasted and will ever taste. It was the rarest and most expensive jam, by far. Also the most complicated to make.

**Ingredients**:Water, sugar, twenty grams of uncut diamonds. Something you wore yesterday, something you were gonna wear tomorrow. Peaches. Lotus flowers.

**Preparation Time**: 77 days.

**Effect**: Minor foresight, equal to the spell of the same name but lasts 1 minute. For 24 hours, gain effects equivalent to the spells *See invisibility*, *Find Traps*, *Tongues* and *Detect Magic*.

*I ate it and I told myself, Findal, you like this. And I did. Never felt so confident in my life. I was like - I asked myself, Findal, you're smart, why don't others do what you say? I really felt like I should be the king of all elves, you know?* Findal, elf criminal accused of attempted regicide and conspiracy to overthrow the kingdom.

**Look and taste**: The magic of control, it's an almost solid grey goop, of unclear taste. People just seem to ""know"" it tastes good, but aren't able to explain why. It just does.

**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, apples, used manacles, three meters of rope, 250 gold coins.    

**Preparation Time**: 10 days.

**Effect**: Extreme confidence, that gives immunity to all fear effects, advantage to resist all types of mental compulsion and advantage on all skill checks to influence other people. May cause extreme recklessness. 

**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours, Once every hour, you can create an effect equivalent to the spell ""Dominate Monster"" just by speaking and giving an order. 

**Location**: written on a napkin by an unknown author, currently at the bottom of a drawer in the house of Mr. Hermann schmidtz, restaurant owner in Baldur's Gate.

- **Evocation** 

*Was as if an army of devils started dancing on my tongue, it was really weird, kinda exhilarating in a way, but I couldn't eat anything else all day. If I had been 20 years younger I may have loved it. Maybe with some drugs too.* - Tobias, human leader of a thieves guild.*

**Look and taste**: The magic of creating all elements, it's a mess: a dozen different colours swirling and twisting without mixing, some points are cold and other hot. The taste is at the same time bitter and sweet, salty and sour, umami and tingly, it's spicy and mint-fresh. Ozone, iron and sulfur. All at once. Popular with young people and artists.

**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, grab a dozen different types of fruits with your eyes closed and throw them in. Rust scraped from a kitchen tool, sand and half a glass of wine. 

**Preparation Time**: 2d4 days.

**Effect**: For 24 hours, all elemental damage is reduced by 3. 

**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours, one randomly selected element deals no damage and instead heals you.

**Location**: Elemental plane of fire, City of Brass, carven in a red dragon skin hidden somewhere.
_____________________

- **Illusion** 

*What's a spelljam? What? This isn't a roasted pig? What about the potatoes? Are you crazy?*

**Look and taste**: Illusion Spelljam isn't jam. Instead, it will take the shape, texture, smell and taste of some other food. What it turns into seems to be random, and changes randomly. It's always very tasty food tho. Somewhat popular, but hard to explain to your clients what they're actually eating.

**Ingredients**: glycerin, salt, an apple painted blue, a Pear painted red, a green pumpkin and a yellow watermelon. 5 pounds of Pyrite. One counterfeited signature. 

**Preparation Time:** The recipe says 7 days but it can take anywhere from 5 to 9.
 
**Effect**: For 24 hours, effect equivalent to the Invisibility spell, advantage on all checks to discover illusions. Also you'll instinctively learn ventriloquism. 

**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours you gain True sight and Greater Invisibility. 

**Location**: There are more than 700 reported copies of this recipe around the world, all different.

- **Necromancy** 

*The most disgusting broth I've ever had to eat, felt like death itself had set camp on my tongue and was taking a dump after a night of vodka and roasted beans. It was so bad all the other bad things in my life started tasting kinda good in comparison, so there is that, I guess.* - King Julius the Fiftieth.

**Look and taste**: A thick, black and green boiling paste, smells and tastes horrible. It requires a Constitution check with DC 15 to not throw up when eating it. The positive is, after that you can eat anything. You could drink swamp water and feed on a rotting rat carcass and not only you won't get sick, they will taste pretty good too. Actually good food will taste like heaven. Still not a very popular jam.

**Ingredients**: Water where a dead body has been for at least a week, no sugar. Rotten Avocado. Jewellery stolen from a grave worth at least 200 pieces of gold.  

**Preparation Time**: 3d6 days.

**Effect**: Permanent immunity to all natural sicknesses. For 24 hours, immunity to natural poisons, advantage on saving throws against magical poison, sickness and death effects.

**True Spelljam effect**: Permanent immunity to all sicknesses and poisons, for 24 hours damage reduction 5 against acid and advantage against death effects and on all saving throws to not die. You will appear to be dead to any scrying or investigation spell.

**Location**: Unknown.

- **Transmutation** 

*No way to describe its taste (see below)*

**Look and taste**: Transmutation Spelljam looks like another type of Spelljam. The only way to realize you've eaten transmutation and not a different variety is from its effect. Otherwise, it's in everything identical to some other version.

**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, tomatoes, apples, cherries. 1 kg of lead, 1 kg of gold.

**Preparation Time**: 20 days. 

**Effect**: For 24 hours, Once per minute the subject can cast one between Gaseous Form, Alter self, feather fall, Meld into stone or Stone shape. They can also turn up to 1 cubic meter of inanimate material they touch into another material of the same type(liquids into liquids, solids into solids etc.)

**True Spelljam effect**: Like above, but instead of once per minute the spells can be used once per round. The subject also gainst the ability to cast Once either Mass Polymorph or True Polymorph. 

**Location**: Owned by the Largeshow family, a wealthy gone family attempting to produce it. ",1,Spelljammer - Magical Jams and how to make them
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,32,249,"World War I was set up to happen years before Franz Ferdinand was shot, due to complex pacts between leaders and the dissatisfaction over division of colonial land. America did not invade Iraq to “spread democracy”, they did it to gain control of Iraq’s oil supply. And Russia is not annexing Crimea and provoking Ukraine by seizing their ships because their presence was an actual danger, they did it because Putin’s approval ratings are falling 

There’s always an economics or political reason behind any war or conflict. It’s very rarely about ideals (even the first crusade can be argued to have been more about defending the Byzantine Empire than taking over Jerusalem). So please, the next time you’re writing a plot centered around a war, don’t make it about two gods being angry at eachother… again. Your world and story will feel much more realistic if you use some elements from the real world.

Today I’m going to present one simple economic theory you can use as a reason a war might start.

# Hume’s Mechanism - Requirements

Also called “[Price-specie flow mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price–specie_flow_mechanism)” describes the drawbacks of limiting trade between countries. It’s an old theory (1749) that has some outdated requirements, so it doesn’t really apply to today’s world. But luckily, most DnD games aren’t set in today’s world. The requirements are:

- [The Gold Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard). Countries must be using gold as a currency (or money that has its value tied to gold). DnD settings use gold, silver, copper, electrum and platinum pieces which is also fine, but for simplicity we’ll assume they only use gold.

- Lack of action from the [central back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank). If you have a somewhat competent central bank like the FED, ECB or BoE set up in your game, then you probably already know enough about this topic to just stop reading  right now. However, most of us don’t have a central bank in your DnD setting at all, so we can continue.

- [Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism). Mercantilism is an economic policy which was typical for European countries in the 16th-18th centuries. Countries that adopted mercantilism seeked to increase their wealth by exporting more goods than they import, thus inreasing the amount of money (gold) in their lands. Although many DnD worlds are set in this time period, their creators for some reason haven’t used this popular policy to create conflict.

I want YOU to use Mercantilism. As we know today, it only lead to conflicts between countries. But people didn’t know that 400 years ago – well to be honest, the leaders probably did, they just didn’t care. Mercantilists seek to increase exports of goods and decrease imports of goods. They do this by applying large [tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff) on imported goods (increasing their price for sovereign citizens – making them less likely to buy imported goods) and offering [subventions](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/subvention) to potential exporters.

# Hume’s Mechanism - Implications

What ends up happening is that your citizens do indeed sell more to citizens of other countries than they buy from them, drawing more money (gold) into your country out of theirs. Now here comes the tricky part: Hume’s Mechanism.

People in your country having more money (gold) than they did before means 2 things:

- **They are WILLING to pay more for things they want to buy.** Would you pay 10$ for a loaf of bread if you only had 100$? Probably not. But would you pay 10$ for a loaf of bread if you had 1.000.000$? Sure, why not.
- **They WANT to be paid more.** Are you going to do some back breaking work for 10$/hour if all you have is 100$. Ofcourse you are, that’s a lot of money for you. Are you going to do some back breaking work for 10$/hour if you have 1.000.000$? Why even bother?

Now these are some extreme examples, but they’re just here to get the point across. Meanwhile, the country that you are exporting into has less money (gold), so the exact opposite is going on over there. That’s why overall prices in your country will rise, while the overall pricess in the foreign country will fall.

# Hume’s Mechanism – Consequences

Now because prices keep falling in the foreign country and prices keep rising in your home country, people from your home country will prefer to buy goods from the foreign country. You have more money and their prices are cheaper, so you’ll get more stuff if you buy from them. This makes it more and more economically expensive for the government to keep up mercantilistm in the form of subventions and more and more politically expensive to keep up mercantilism in the form of tariffs (your people will be angry if you try so hard to stop them from taking a foreign citizen's better offer).

So eventually the foreign country will start importing more goods into your country than you export into their country. This means your country is losing money (gold) and the foreign country is gaining money (gold). This will keep happening until the foreign country becomes the rich one, you become the poor one and the roles are reversed.

One such cycle could take up to 20 years to complete. That would be about 10 years of you being the rich country and 10 years of you being the poor country. If you’re the country on the positive side of this exchange, that’s great for you. But if you’re the country that’s going to suffer for 10 years, what do you do? You’re losing money, which means two things: you can’t afford to buy goods or resources from other countries, where they might have been cheaper before &amp; you are experiencing deflation, which disincentivizes your citizens from spending money (gold), as it will be worth more in the future – and a lack of spending causes recessions (like the financial crisis we experienced from 2007- 2013).

# Hume’s Mechanism – Solution

How do you solve this? How do you stay on the rich side rather than dropping to the poor side of this cycle? How do you get out of the poor side of this cycle? Simple, you get more gold into your country.

- You can apply mercantilist economic policies like the other countries are doing. Tariffs &amp; subventions. But if ALL countries do this, then the benefits end up canceling eachother out and all you are left with is a global economy where countries refuse to trade with eachother (that’s how the Great Depression happened).

- You beat the shit out of other people and steal their gold. Why did Spain need to massacre the population of South America? Because they had gold that Spain wanted. Simple investment: if you get more money (gold) from the people you attack than you lose due to the costs of war, then you do it.

Do you explain this to your people? While to me (and hopefully you) this is interesting, most people won’t find this a fun read and won’t be very convinced by it. So what do you tell your people instead to get the hyped up about going to war? We need to honour a friend’s friend’s request and avenge their prince. We need to liberate the people of that country over there. We need to protect out borders from our neighbours.

## Important

And remember boys: While Mercantilism was a very widespread ideology, Hume’s mechanism is just a theory. Very rarely did it actually happen in real life. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use it as a reason a war might start in your world, where you can make sure all the requirements are set for this to happen. Also, this example is not something you should use to explain today’s economics. Sure, there’s some protectionism going on, but nothing like what used to be normal.

Some of this was **very** simplified. If you need additional explanations or want to debate any of this, drop a comment.",1,How to Start a War? Economics with Burning
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,45,152,"In my campaign setting, wizards guard their true names carefully. A wizard’s power derives from studying and learning and speaking the true names in the tongue of creation. They understand what secrets lie in dusty tomes. One might spend a lifetime in search of a single word, to unlock unimaginable power, magic never before seen. Yet their strength is also their weakness.

The evil archmage, thought untouchable in her tower, may be defeated by investigating, tracing, tracking, and finally unveiling her origin. She may have returned to her pathetic little home town. Burned it to the ground. Killed all who ever knew her. Yet her name may live on. In the memory of a distant traveler. In a closely guarded diary. In the whisper of a ghost.

What tangible advantage comes from knowing the name of a wizard, though? Does it offer protection from their magic? (Advantage on saving throws.) Does it reveal or impart a weakness? (Vulnerability to damage, or bonus psychic damage.) Does it infuriate them, terrify them, or bind them to the speaker? (Crown of Madness, Compulsion, Antipathy/Sympathy, or Dimensional Anchor.) What do you think? How can this theme be mechanically represented?

To answer this question, I looked at the power of names in fantasy, such as in A Wizard of Earthsea or Harry Potter. (Spoilers follow.)

In A Wizard of Earthsea, names are used both as a weapon and as a symbol of trust and friendship. &gt;!When standing alone against an ancient dragon, the protagonist gambles his life “on a guess drawn from the old histories of dragon-lore learned on Roke, a guess that this Dragon of Pendor was the same that had spoiled the west of Osskil in the days of Elfarran and Morred.” His guess holds true. A deal is brokered with the dragon, to spare the people of the archipelago.!&lt;

At one point, the protagonist’s closest friend gives him a great gift: &gt;!the knowledge of his true name. “No one knows a man’s true name but himself and his namer. He may choose at length to tell it to his brother, or his wife, or his friend, yet even those few will never use it where any third person may hear it.” And, “If plain men hide their true name from all but a few they love and trust utterly, so much more must wizardly men, being more dangerous, and more endangered. Who knows a man’s name, holds that man’s life in his keeping.”!&lt;

We probably all know the power of names in Harry Potter. &gt;!Practically everyone lives in fear of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, cringing when the taboo is broken. Dumbledore, however, is different. “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” Harry eventually goes one step further, addressing the villain as Tom Riddle, reminding him of his humanity, his vulnerability, his mortality. The thing he fears the most.!&lt;

It seems obvious how this could make for a great quest in D&amp;D. Fear of mortality is the driving force behind the archetypical lich. Invoking its true name could be so much more than just psychologically powerful, it could be essential to defeating it. And the process of discovering that long forgotten name should thus be arduous, convoluted, and comparable to the process of locating its phylactery. 

So what do you think? What are other examples of the power of names in fantasy? How can these ideas be implemented into the game, both in terms of plot and mechanics?

I finally got to play with my Labyrinth mechanics I've built for our adventure and everyone thought it was super fun. The basic idea is that you use a Deck of Cards to represent your Labyrinth and all the crazy things that can happen as you try to navigate it. You can encounter monsters, disarm traps, get lost, and find your way out, all with minimal explanation. I think when we ran this tonight it took about 15min total, maybe less? My party managed to avoid the monster placed inside the Labyrinth, but only slightly. Each turn they bantered back and forth about which actions to take and when, and there was a lot of critical thinking employed to try and manipulate the Labyrinth deck in their favor. I have a party of 4 so the rules are kind of built with that in mind. I believe this will work just as well with a larger party, but there might be a breaking point there somewhere.

# The Adviser 

Druids often find themselves in positions close to those in power, due to their knowledge of the wilds and their ability to commune with plants, animals, and nature spirits, in addition to their knowledge of medicine and healing. In historical-Earth terms, Druids were often looked to to settle disputes over law or tradition, and in D&amp;D this can translate into Druids being seen as a sort of ""legal or technical adviser"" to a Baron, Earl, Duke, King or Queen, or any sort of political power - from tribal leader to Emperor. 

Druids can steer their employers to certain ends, if they are clever, getting natural areas mandated as ""Royal Preserves"", or ending the egregious stripping of natural resources within political boundaries. A Druid may educate a leader's children in the arts and sciences of wilderness management and herbalism, hoping to shape their futures (and perhaps even guide them towards becoming Druids themselves). The Druid will attempt to shape policy and attitudes towards the preservation and sustainable cultivation of nature and its resources.

If the Druid is advising a powerful political entity, like a king or queen, they will ask for sanctions against poachers, loggers, or miners, especially in areas where Dwarves and Gnomes are prevalent. If the Druid is advising a tribal or village leader, they will argue strongly against letting allies hunt, fish, and log in the boundaries of the tribe or village's influence. 

In times of disease, disaster, or war, the adviser will take a pragmatic approach to all things, and the death of innocents is often seen as a balance to the death of the guilty. If hundreds should die so that thousands may live, so be it. Druids take the long view of the cycle of life, and often have ""hundred year plans"" that they try to secretly pursue and enact. 

In any case, the Druid is a wily political foe. With magical resources available to them, there are very little in the way of secrets that can get past a Druid's scrutiny. The ability to speak to animals and plants alone is a powerful espionage device that allows the Druid to have ""eyes and ears"" everywhere. 

The Druid Adviser is not always ""attached at the hip"" of their employer however. A Druid, able to keep an eye on things through magical means, often will ""show up"" right when they are needed or an important decision is to be made, only to later disappear for weeks or months at a time - traveling throughout the lands (often in disguise) and gathering information that could be useful to himself or his employer. Some may take the form of local animals and hang around the area, remaining disguised and seeing what transpires in their absence. 

Druids that take on the role of Adviser often have proficiency in Deception, History, Insight, Perception, and Persuasion to assist them in their ""courtly duties"".  

# Spell Packages

# NPC Examples

* **Borr Mapleleaf**: This Halfling adviser is a militant hothead who has been pressing his superior to take up arms against the Dwarven encampments in the mountains who have been pulling gold and silver from deep mines and have refused to pay taxes on their finds. Borr has sent many spies among them and knows they have slandered the ruler's name. He is quick to anger and loathe to forgive.
* **Ancya Kvetch**: This Human adviser has steered their territory towards a kindly and harmonious relationship with the wilderness that surrounds it. She is a gracious and soft-spoken woman who has never been seen to lose her temper. She guards a dark secret.
* **Goodberry Sundawn**: This Elven adviser has a ""500 year plan"" to reshape the territory that they oversee into a garden paradise. Goodberry is a ruthless and cunning foe who has spies in the hundreds. All who would try and oppose her have been murdered or disappeared. Nothing and no one will get in her way - not even the King she serves.


# Plot Hooks

* The party has wandered into an Adviser's territory and the Druid secretly spies upon them until they leave their influence. If the party transgresses (hunting too much, destroying natural resources), the Druid will inform their superior and a group will be sent to detain them.
* A local ruler has a pet raven that never leaves his side, and is often seen talking to it. Though the ruler is beloved and his rule just, there are many who believe him to be slightly mad. At night, strangely, the raven can be seen flying in the local area. 
* A baron's adviser has been murdered and the locals are up in arms, going from house-to-house and shop-to-shop, accosting any strangers and accusing them of the murder. The adviser's kin (several mid-level Druids) are on hand to assist in the interrogation. False clues have led the mob to the party themselves.
* A king has declared a large section of the forest ""Royal Lands"" and the local foresters are protesting outside the city walls. They are drunk and angry and ready to riot. The king's adviser has a spy planted among them - a favorite hunting dog named Blue. 
* A local village elder has just welcomed a Druid into his inner circle - a forester's child who has shown the gift of animal affinity, and declared the child their trusted adviser. There are some, however, who suspect the child is not what they seem.",1,Druids Conclave: The Adviser

**Temple of the Muad'dib** (yes...Muad'dib, like from Dune...the Spice must flow (I liked the word, sounds cool))

&amp;#x200B;

The temple has been abandoned for centuries, in it's day Pilgrims  would come to the temple to follow in the footsteps of The Muad'dib (in my world, the Muad'dib were a group of 5 people that saved the world from the Elder Gods, but feel free to make the temple serve whatever purpose you need it to).

&amp;#x200B;

The party comes upon a 7 sided temple buried deep in the jungle, vines creep up the sides of the brown sandstone. A large staircase stands before them leading to the temple's chapel. The 5 walls have engraved murals showing the Elder Gods ruling over the sentient races, the Muad'dib rising up and traveling the world finding the Places of Power where they sacrificed themselves to banish their oppressors from this world (obviously this is all flavor for my campaign, make it whatever you want). The chapel contains long unused pews and an alter, on either side are hallways leading to the living spaces used by the temple staff. Behind the alter is a stairway leading down.

&amp;#x200B;

The stairway leads to 6 sided room, one wall contains the stairs, the other 5 have an engraving of a Muad'dib.

**Hunter: Aznar Thunderdelver**

* **Clue:** Aznar taught us that we the prey, when pushed hard enough, can become the predator
* **Entrance:** As you walk down the tunnel you feel a pressure in the air pushing back at you, almost as if you’re walking through a thick liquid. As you push on, you feel a tingling in your skin and eventually a “pop” in your ears. Behind you, the temple hallway behinds you appears through a heat haze, everything is slightly out of focus. The branch of the temple ends in a large cylindrical cavern with no visible ceiling. The side walls are just barely visible. You stand at the top of a 200’ waterfall the empties with a dull roar below you. Stretching before you is a canopy of trees reaching forward further than you can see. Small tropical birds fly above the treetops providing spots of reds, yellows, and oranges on an otherwise green canvas.
* **Trial:** Survive in the jungle, reach the monument at the far end. (The point is to make the party feel like they're being hunted, if they stop to fight, more enemies keep coming after them. They need to survive for 3 days before they meet the big enemy)
   * Hunted by 8 velociraptors:
      * Perception checks/passive perception to see glimpses of something hunting the party
      * Skill check to outrun them (5/7 successes DC 18)
      * Failure means combat with 8 velociraptors (use Allosaurus stat block)
   * If the party rests, they get attacked by 3 shambling mounds
   * DC17 Survival checks to make their way towards the far end of the trial. Failure means they lose a day. The whole trial takes 3 days.
   * Fight the King of Feathers from ToA (T-Rex that can summon swarms of bees)
* **End of the tunnel:** Statue of Aznar. At the base are the magical coordinates

**Warrior: Arbella Morningfall**

* **Clue:** Arbella teaches us that when we need to fight, fight with honor
* **Entrance:** The hallway opens to a 60’ octagonal pit. Above the sides are bleachers looking down. Seated among those bleachers, a spectral crowd cheers as you enter. On each wall stands a large stone statue of a warrior.
* **Trial:** 1 Statue comes to life for each player that enters the arena. Use Hill Giant stats (maybe nerf HP depending how fight is going)

**Survivor: Egos Lithtaur**

* **Clue:** Egos teaches us that we need to master our fears if we want to survive
* **Entrance:** You walk down a long winding stone hallway that descends further and further into the ground. As you walk along an almost palpable darkness encroaches on you, those with darkvision realize they can’t see into it. Magical light is unable to pierce the veil. You continue moving forward only to realize there is no one around you. You can no longer see or hear your friends
* **Trial:** Each PC starts having horrible visions related to their backstory. They must complete a skill challenge (2/3 successes DC15-20 depending on how they use the skills) to pass the trial. Anyone who passes links up with the group in a well lit cave with the teleportation runes on a wall. Anyone who falls is mentally/emotionally shaken for 1D4 days (disadvantage on skill checks and WIS saves)

**Healer: Galtan Cleves**

* **Clue:** Galtan teaches us that helping life is much harder than taking it
* **Entrance:** A shimmering portal stands before you. When you walk through you find yourself in a frozen wasteland. A biting cold wind whips up the snow around you. You hear a mighty roar (everyone rolls Insight check, DC15 - the creature sounds like it’s in pain)
* **Trial:** A yeti comes out covered in pulsing black boils. The veins on his arms and chest are also black. The party rolls initiative. They need to heal  the yeti with magic or hold him down and lance the boils (I made my party us 5 levels worth of healing spells total). If they kill the yeti, other arctic creatures approach with the same boils. When they heal/lance the boils, they hear a psychic scream in their heads. The first creature to be completely healed will lead the party back to its cave where the teleportation runes are written on the wall.

**Artist: Artin Goold - Halfling:** (this is the puzzle taken from another user, it was a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfompGbslrV_YvQ4ktPnY7vg-_blkIZ72hPcXLEWZdQ/edit) with 60 dungeon puzzles)

* **Clue:** Artin teaches us that beauty comes from finding order in the chaos
* **Entrance:** You enter a large round domed chamber. There are small goblets of floating lights dancing along the ceiling cascading the room in a myriad of different colors. In the center of the room you see three empty pedestals, along the wall, you see small shadowed alcoves evenly spaced. In the alcoves are a small statues.
* **Trial:** The party must place the correct statues on the pedestals. Placing the wrong three results in a roll on the wild magic table in the Sorcerer section of the PHB. When the correct statues are placed on the pedestals, the dancing lights on the ceiling rearrange to become the teleportation runes the party needs.

9. Rooster",1,Here's a 5 room dungeon my party is currently in
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,82,1438,"I used to think the idea of a dungeon, let alone a MEGADUNGEON, was boring. Going from stone room to stone room, fighting orcs. I was fourteen then, and it wasn't for another 4 years, when Dark Souls came out, that I learned the beauty of the Megadungeon. 

1. Megadungeon as a style of play
--
* In Dark Souls, you measure your progress in several things - areas cleared, bonfires lit, and bosses defeated. In Megadungeons, you measure your progress in rooms cleared. 
* Dark Souls uses the idea of a room as a metaphorical thing. A room is any place where a thing is located. Firelink Shrine and the NPCs are a room. The cemetery below is a room with the skeletons which do not stay down. Keeping it simple like this can make designing a Megadungeon much easier. 
* Dark Souls tells story through this process - each region has a tale told by the order of its rooms, and the encounters in those rooms. While designing your own megadungeon, think in these terms. How can the rooms and the encounters tell a story? 
* In this way, Megadungeon is a style of play, rather than a location. It's a style of play that focuses on the ROOM and the ENCOUNTER and how those are linked together to tell a story.
* Continuing the war example: the battlefield region could have 1.) foxholes filled with terrified soldiers, 2.) a trench with wounded men clogging the route, 3.) front lines with constant machine gun fire and an incompetent commander, 4.) no man's land, with enemies charging with bayonets. This tells a story of the region, and the players that move through it will forward the story of the Party.

2. The Beauty of the 5e Adventure Day
--
* Dark Souls is a game of attrition. Resources are your only way of survival. Health, Stamina, estus, spells, etc. This. Is. DnD.
* In 5e, health, HD, spells, potions, etc. are the resources you need to continue adventuring. 
* In Dark Souls, reaching a bonfire is a goal because it means rest and replenishing resources. In 5e, this is the adventure day.
* The adventure day - typically - says that a party can handle 5-8 encounters from easy-hard difficulty before needing a long rest. During this day you can have short rests to expend HD and replinish certain abilities.
* You can use this in your Megadungeon game to create story. Nothing is more exciting and tension driven in Dark Souls than when you're running low on everything and having to decide whether you are going back or moving forward in hopes of a bonfire.
* Take this example and place safe spots (bonfires) in your Megadungeon. Place them at the end of Adventuring days. 

-----------------------------
EXAMPLE
--
* Taking a look at Dark Souls as an example of excellent design - From Firelink Shrine to the first bonfire, there are 5 necessary encounters: the undead on the stairs, the undead playing dead, the undead where the dragon lands, the crossbow undead, and the undead with the shields and spears. Each one takes place in its own ""room"", with the crossbow-men being able to fire down on you while taking on another encounter. 

* Not only this but there are 3 optional rooms for extra xp and treasure - the rat in the sewer guarding the humanity, the secret jump to get the treasure in the building, and the hidden NPC downstairs which sells stuff.

* THAT'S the perfect example of how to design an adventure day. In DnD that entire thing might take a session, maybe two, depending. And when you start looking at Dark Souls like that, you can see that all areas are the same. And they USE the Adventure Day to build tension. Sometimes making them shorter, and sometimes forcing you to go 14-15 encounters before reaching the next one.

---------------------------------

2a Adventure Day Continued
--
* When designing your regions for your Megadungeon, use the idea of the adventure day to add another layer to the story. The layer which taxes the PLAYERS resource management. With this, you have both layer of the game engaged - the characters and their buy-in, and the players with their character sheets.
* 
* Continuing the war example: after crossing no-man's land, the opposing force is pushed back and the Party can finally rest before being awoken by artillery the next day.

3. The importance of NPCs
--
* Dark Souls uses NPCs for very few reasons - covenants, buying/selling, and optional story. But all of these impact the world of Dark Souls, a lonely world where you make it on your own.
* Let this influence your own NPC design. Let the theme of your world influence your NPC design. 
* Ask yourself what role they fill. Are they here to buy/sell? What would a buyer/seller look like in your world?
* In this hypothetical war campaign, a buyer/seller would be the guy at the barracks, or a medic on the field, or the guy riding around in the jeep with all the bullets. 
* The other NPCs, keep their story on an optional level, but don't be worried about having NPCs reappear, like when Big Hat Logan shows up after being freed. 
* Have NPCs disappear, like the Cleric that stands near the back of Firelink. If this draws interest, then great, if not, then that's one less NPC you have to worry about.
* NPCs as optional stories in the War Campaign could be a soldier that joins the squad, a tank sergeant that keeps needing help, a daring spy that is offering coin for info, a cartographer that needs help mapping the enemy territory. People that can enrich the world, but aren't necessary if the party isn't interested.
 
4. Locks, Keys, and Gates
--
* Dark Souls has *some* backtracking, to say the least. There are doors that can't be opened, paths that shouldn't be traveled, creatures which can't be beat. These require you to go do some other shit then come back later.
* When designing your regions, don't hesitate to put in rooms that need a key. Just like the room, the key can be metaphorical. 
* In the War Campaign, a key can be a new rank that gives access to new areas/information, it can be a commanding officer that you have to get in good with, it can be an injury that puts you in a new location for recovery. 
* 5e has some locked gates built in - certain spells such as Fly allow access to the air in a new way. Water breathing potions/spells give you access to new locations. Druid wild shapes could give access to animal areas previous unallowed. Paladin oaths can give you access to locations.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,18,"Hey y'all, I created a pantheon of more or less morally grey nature deities for my current campaign, and I'm going to attempt to post them all here sometime, in no particular order. This is the second in the series: The God of the Sea, Death and Souls: Toharik

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Name(s):** Toharik, Tahuari or Shai'harok. All cultures know Death, and have their own name for him.

**Titles:** The Fallen King, Lord of Souls, King in the Sea, the Undying Tide, Keeper of the Bloody Curse, Triarch of Death.

**Domains:** Sea, tides, souls, death, entropy and erosion, inevitability, fate, doom.

**Mythology:** In the beginning, there were the two Primordial Beings: Arkir, the Earth, and Toharik, the Sky. Toharik was male to Arkir's female, soul to her body. And yet the earth was barren and the sky was a formless, empty void.
The two fell in love, and together they bore children. Life-giving rain fell from the sky, and from the womb of the earth, the first true life emerged in the shape of a single plant.

Excited about their creation, the two Primordial Beings then gave life to two more litters of children: first the ancient Beast Gods, ancestors of dragons and all modern beasts, and then the triplets [Yivra](https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9pdea7/yivra_mother_sun_and_the_queen_above_the_clouds/), Reak and Vraek, ancestors of the giants. And their children named them Mother Earth and Father Sky.

The earth was crawling with life, and the sky was filled with song. The world was vibrant and alive. But it was not to last.

A rebellion led by Yivra against the primordial gods saw Toharik, the Father Sky murdered; his heart torn out and his life-giving power absorbed by his daughter, who ascended and transformed into the Sun.

Toharik fell to the earth, and with his last breath he uttered the Bloody Curse upon his children, the other gods: That all of their descendants would be mortal, have to feast on the life of eachother to survive, and would eventually have to surrender their souls to him in death.

Grieving, the Earth Mother embraced her fallen husband, and her salted tears formed the seas around his body.

Ever since, the Fallen King has maintained his undying vigil from the bottom of the sea, his sundered spirit caring for one thing only: Ensuring that each and every living thing will eventually, one way or another, come unto their maker and join him in death.

The Tide of Souls draws all things to the sea eventually. None shall escape the Bloody Curse.

**Dogma:** Alongside the reigning Sky Goddess Yivra and the Earth Mother Arkir, the King in the Sea is one of the three gods that all known cultures either worship outright, or at the very least pay the proper amount of respect. Sacrifices to Toharik are mostly done to placate him and avoid his wrath; this is obviously most important to coastal cultures, as the sea, ironically, is all-important to their continued existence, but the Fallen King's wrath is feared by land-dwellers as well.

And the fear of death is most definitely the fuel for most of the sacrifices made to Toharik. To the uninitiated, Toharik appears to be a distant, cruel and callous deity, who bestows numerous curses and no blessings.

His worshippers see it in a notably different light. Worship of Toharik is about accepting the inevitability of the end; about achieving peace of mind and reconciling oneself with the knowledge that one is mortal and finite. The devotees of Toharik are stoic, calm, humble and often surprisingly iron-willed and enduring. When you have stared into the Abyss that is the sea without flinching, there is little left that can surprise you, and life with all its suffering becomes much more bearable.

Indeed, the clergy of Toharik believe that death is a mercy. The world is a fundamentally broken and diseased place, full of suffering and evil, tainted by antediluvian sin caused by prideful gods at the dawn of time. After a lifetime in such a world, death is like going to rest after a very long day, rocked to sleep in the cradle of the waves.

While all cultures worship Toharik in different ways, his dogma can generally be summarised as follows:

* All Things End and Return to the Sea: Through erosion, even mountains will be ground to dust and swallowed by the sea. Time will grind even great empires to dust, and even the healthiest bodies and the strongest of souls will eventually give up the ghost, and have their spirits gently pulled to the depths of the ocean, never to return.

* Resistance is Futile: Toharik may not exert much power over the works and ways of mortals, for the void of his heart holds no care for their schemes... unless they concern cheating death. The only thing that can stir the Fallen King to action is attempts at breaking the Bloody Curse, and the wrath of the Lord of Souls is terrifying. Tales of tidal waves swallowing cities whole and the appearance of monstrous krakens remind the faithful that death is inevitable. All too often, however, immortals like liches and vampires manage to gain enough infamy to engineer their own destruction without Toharik's intervention. Toharik is eternal, and eternally patient.

* Pride is the root of all evil: It was pride that drove Yivra to murder her father, and pride that causes mortals to oppress eachother and attempt to cheat death, bringing the wrath of the gods down upon them and their peers. The faithful of Toharik stress above anything else that pride and vanity is the foulest of all the sins.

* Death is final: A very important point of dogma for the Toharite faith is that death is final and irreversible. The faithful of Toharik believe that all souls are ultimately drawn to the sea, a phenomenon known as the Soultide. Even ghosts and other undying creatures who haunt their resting places will, eventually, be unable to resist the pull of the sea, and be ""washed away"" to the sea, even if they died far from it. And once one's spirit has disappeared beneath the waves, the faithful hold, it is impossible to escape, and heretical to attempt. The followers of Toharik aggressively stamp out beliefs in reincarnation or ressurection, as well as all forms of necromancy.

* Death is a mercy: Perhaps surprisingly, the Toharite faith is full of ghost stories. Fables and legends of terrible wraiths unable to let go of their former life, causing great suffering to themselves and those around them. These stories often end with brave and god-fearing heroes either slaying these spirits or convincing them to let go, in either case returning their spirits to the sea and letting them rest in peace. Resisting death, the faithful hold, can and will only lead to suffering for oneself and others. Fittingly, the death penalty is in many cultured called ""The King's Mercy"".

* Acceptance brings peace: The end goal of all faithful of Toharik is accepting their eventual demise, allowing them to shoulder the burden of living better. Once Acceptance of the inevitable is achieved, your existence will be a peaceful, rather than troubled one.

**Tenets:** It is an ill-kept secret that Toharik himself is a silent god, who cares little for how mortals live, or whether their lives are pleasant or painful, only that they end eventually. His followers, however, have contemplated what to make of this irreversible fact for millenia, and have cultivated several tenets to speed mortals towards Acceptance of their doom. They are most commonly expressed through the following virtues:

* Humility: The most fundamental virtue is the absence of Pride, and the most crucial one to Acceptance; and thus also, the trickiest to master. Acceptance comes when you realize that you are mortal, fallible, and fundamentally outmatched. It will also make your life easier to realize that there are things you cannot change.

* Temperance: If all you seek in life is to experience greater ecstacy or to enjoy it as much as possible, it will be all the more painful when it is eventually taken away. Hedonism only leads to suffering, not to peace of mind.

* Gratitude: Seeking greater material wealth is a fool's errand, for gold is material and cannot be brought with you to the sea. One should find gratitude in what one possesses, instead of constantly seeking more.

* Stoicism: Emotional attachment is, while not necessarily prohibited, ultimately misguided and a key component of suffering. When confronted with war, plague, crime and betrayal, the faithful are asked to endure in the knowledge that this, too, shall pass.

* Mercy: The faithful of Toharik are asked to do their best to help eachother endure the trials of life to alleviate eachother's suffering, and to forgive transgressions made against them. Sometimes, however, a Toharite's definition of ""mercy"" may also extend to applying the death penalty to a person who is seen as causing suffering to himself and others; this is thought to be merciful both towards the criminal and his victims.

**Allies of the Faith:** Toharik himself cares naught for allies. Anyone who doesn't stand in the way of the inevitability of death is an ""ally""; anyone who stands against him is an enemy. The faithful, however, do find some of the other faiths easier to work with than others:

*Arkir*, goddess of the earth and the law, is a common ally of Toharik's faithful, for she also urges her followers to submit to authority and accept their lot in life. However, some of her followers, particularly kings, queens and judges, are far too prideful by half and prone to delusions of grandeur.

*Xashir*, goddess of the stars, is thought to offer guidance to lost souls who seek the sea, and as goddess of foresight, fate and wisdom, her followers often preach acceptance of death as well.

*Voruug*, god of disease and retribution, is perhaps the closest thing Toharik himself has to an ally. Charged with delivering decay and ruin to all who anger the Gods, Voruug and his followers often serve as the Fallen King's headsmen on land, where the waves do not reach. Voruug reminds mortals that escaping from the sea does not make you escape from death.

**Enemies of the Faith:** Officially, Toharik does not have any real enemies. There are some faiths, however, who often have strained relations with Toharik's followers. These are:

*Vraekul*. While Toharik himself cares not one iota for the conflict between Yivra and Vraekul, several of the Fiend Lords that dwell in Vraekul's shadowed realm dabble in all manner of necromancy and other perversions. Though official Toharite dogma holds that not even the greatest demon can defeat Toharik and contest death, many of the greatest priests of Toharik secretly fear what would happen to the natural order of things should the creatures of the Night win. As such, the faithful of Toharik are often vigilantly opposed to worship of the God of Night or his fiendish underlings.

*Zalkor*, god of the forest, rivers, cycles and preservation, is a curious case. Most of them acknowledge Toharik as the god of death, and help lead souls to rivers that they may reach the sea, but some Zalkorites believe in druidic principles of reincarnation and the cycle of life and death. Toharite dogma holds that death is final, not cyclical, leading to frequent ideological (but rarely violent) clashes between these two faiths.

*Yivra*, goddess of sun and sky, is also a complicated case. Obviously she was the one who murdered Toharik and stole his role as the god of the sky and bringer of life. However, officially, Yivrite doctrine recognizes Toharik's authority as god of death, and Yivrite templars are often some of the most fanatic and spirited hunters of undead, necromancers and fiends, so the faithful of both deities often have similar goals. But behind the scenes, the two faiths often have widely different perspectives on life and death, leading to some ill-hidden animosity.

**Clergy and Temples:** Toharik's shrines and temples are often modest stone buildings, either built near the coast or along rivers. Built to last, they are often sparsely decorated, and sermons are held inside, to allow refuge from the distractions from the outside world and allow for contemplations of mortality.

The Fallen King's clerics often wear dim colours, often gray and faded sea blue, or shades of greenish-blue. In civilizations distant from the sea, clerics occasionally wear black.
Toharik's two most common symbols are the Broken Crown, symbolizing the murder of Toharik and his undying authority, and the Tidal Wave, symbolizing the all-devouring power of the sea.

Toharik's clerics serve the community by offering consolation to the grieving, observing burial rites and passing on wisdom to help ease the burden of others. Most are deliberately poor and lead celibate, contemplative lives.

Holidays and Festivals: Toharites have few celebrations, and instead place much more emphasis on everyday sermons. There are a few noteworthy traditions throughout the year that most cultures observe to honor Toharik. Most of these holidays have no set days, and depend upon environmental features:

* The Day of Aging is traditionally celebrated on the day when the first trees begin to lose their leaves. Here, the elders of the community are invited to contemplate the last phase of their lives, to tell the stories of their lives and pass on their wisdoms to the next generation. The young ones are invited to contemplate the frailty of all things.

* The Day of Mourning is traditionally held at first snowfall, or (in cultures where it doesn't snow) halfway through the first month of winter. Here, those who have died throughout the year are remembered and talked about, in an attempt to accept their passing.

* The Sacrifice of Lament is held in early spring, when snow starts to melt. A new year of worries and burdens approaches, and the faithful are asked to offer up a prized possession of theirs that causes them great worry; either by ceremonially throwing it into the sea, or alternately by burning it on an offering pyre. Usually these are of mostly emotional, and not practical value, such as a family heirloom, the toy of a lost child, or a grandmother's trinket. It may also be a simple sacrifice of coin. The point is for the faithful to overcome the fear of losing their material possessions, or the memories that those material possessions invoke in them. In sacrificing them, they symbolically sacrifice their worries as well.

* The Day of Humility and Contemplation is held a few days after midsummer, where the faithful contemplate what they have achieved during the year and remind themselves not to let their achievements make them overconfident. A small sacrifice of the boons one has reaped during the year is expected; one to Toharik and one to the community at large.

**Champions and Avatars:**

Being a champion of Toharik is, to an extent, about not being famous, nor striving for fame. Still, there are numerous tales of those who championed the ideals of the Lord of Souls that are often retold.

One such tale tells of Sir Havritz, a young and rich knight at the prime of his life, wielding his family's ancestral magic sword and armor, who defeated a death knight by luring him and his undead army to the sea, and holding the death knight off long enough for a tidal wave to swallow them all. Sir Havritz had sacrificed himself, his family heirlooms, and his life as a wealthy nobleman to Toharik, to save his community and put an end to a monster. Thus, he became one of the most popular (and only) saints of the Triarch of Death.

**Known Sects/Cults:**

*The Wavewaker Cult* is, quite paradoxically, a group of necromancers, typically wizards and bards, and is thus viewed to be heretical by the orthodox Toharite faith. Specifically, the Wavewaker mystics are said to reawaken spirits of the dead from their resting place in the sea, using thaumaturgical summoning circles, or by having bards recite ancient verses to the sea. The Wavewakers then direct these spirits to carry out certain tasks in the material world, after which the spirit returns to rest; they may, for instance, awaken a dragonslayer to assist a group of heroes in taking down a dragon, or awaken the spirit of an ancestor to settle an inheritance dispute. Adherents proclaim that they are making the world a better place, but orthodox Toharites believe they are mystics who defile the sanctity of the dead for material purposes.

*The Tomb of Secrets* is a fanatical organization that believes that some knowledge is dangerous and heretical, and therefore partakes in assassinations, book burnings and destruction of magical artifacts. The more extreme variants of this sect actively seek to ""destroy history"", and seek out ruins of old civilizations who have met their end, and try to collapse or destroy them, that their knowledge may never be relearned. Officially, the church of Toharik denies the existence of the Tomb, but does little to persecute them.",1,"Toharik, King in the Sea, and Fallen Lord of Souls"

Every DM passionately extolls the virtues (and, if available, cataclysmic capabilities) of his or her favourite monsters. For some, the reliably menacing Tarrasque inspires incomparable fear in their players. Others enjoy terrorizing their players with the catastrophic hunger of Krakens or the violent, clinical curiosity of Mind Flayers. Personally, I'm partial to Hags. Specifically, I devilishly enjoy the idiosyncratic mastery of magic demonstrated by Hags. Where Liches and Ancient Dragons unleash identifiable destruction, Hags innovatively redesign magic and craft sinister foci. Volo's Guide to Monsters details this innovation; Hags are afforded access to Weird Magic. They use apparently innocuous foci to manifest appropriately strange effects: angry wasps stitch together a Hag's wounds; a crudely fashioned straw doll transmits pain when harmed; an alluring hand mirror with a frame made of bone traps souls.

However, my love for enterprising Hags was always hindered by the presence of traditional magic. Hags use Weird Magic but they cast spells traditionally. Moreover, their mastery of magic is entirely technical; Hags are maniacal engineers, achieving the strange by working in gruesome laboratories. Thus, I decided to redesign Hags' approach to magic. I titled this restructuring of magic mastery—*Maleficarum*, or the perversion of magic. *Maleficarum* is a Latin word translated directly as ""wicked"" or vicious. It was popularly used in the *Malleus Maleficarum*, or Hammer of Witches: a manual on witchcraft and how to appropriately punish witches, published in the 15th century. The *Malleus Maleficarum* was later used brutally prosecute alleged witches during the Rennaisance. It's fitting, then, for Hags to wield the Hammer of Witches against their enemies.

# Maleficarum: Perverse Arcanum

First, I need to distinguish those Hags capable of Maleficarum from Sublunary, or""common"", Hags. The latter are those described in the Monster Manual and supplementary sources: conniving, wicked, and darkly whimsical creatures who can only propagate by consuming prepubescent girls. Alternatively, common Hags produce Fomorians after consuming prepubescent boys. Collectively, common Hags are identified as Sublunary Hags; those Hags capable of weaving magic but incapable of changing magic.

Comparatively, Primaeval Hags are to Sublunary Hags what Ancient Dragons are to Kobolds. Scholars are unsure when these abstruse creatures were identified as Hags; however, scholars unanimously agree Primaeval Hags are not truly Hags. They are material manifestations of unfettered, irrepressible, unmatched magic—chaos made real. Primaeval Hags are ""birthed"" when magic collapses, thereby creating a pocket of highly aberrant magic. Put succinctly, Primaeval Hags are magical prions: each encourages and facilitates the collapsing of magic, thus propagating more. In turn, these creatures demonstrate unparalleled arcane feats; this is Maleficarum, the perversion of magic. Consequently, Wild Magic Sorcerers are mistakenly identified as the agents of this aberrant magical activity.

Moreover, a Primaeval Hag *is* magic—it cannot be permanently destroyed. The only prescribed technique of reliably undoing a Primaeval Hag is impaling it with cold iron, such that the cold iron is simultaneously rooted in the ground. The cold iron effectively leeches the Primaeval Hag's magic, which causes the Hag to gradually dematerialize. Manuals on destroying Primaeval Hags typically instruct adventurers to pierce the Hag's womb; this technique is plausibly sourced from the literary conflation of Primaeval Hags and Sublunary Hags.

""Leeching"" only arrests Primaeval Hags: its aberrant magic is reconstituted after 1d12 x 10 months. A Primaeval Hag rarely returns in a form identical to its antecedent—however, it does preserve every memory and experience. Additionally, leeching impairs a Primaeval Hag's demonstration of magic. When a Primaeval Hag returns, it loses spell levels equal to 1/2 x the number of months it was destroyed. It restores lost spell levels when it reaches the age at which it died.

The indisputable power of Primaeval Hags frightens Dragons and Giants and Liches alike. The lifespan of a Dragon or Giant is predetermined; Primaeval Hags exist so long as magic exists. Young Dragons foolishly forge pacts with Primaeval Hags: the former learn ancient magic while the latter receive unaware servants. Even Ancient Dragons concede the superiority of Primaeval Hags; it is not uncommon for Ancient Dragons to forfeit their territory.

Two types of Primaeval Hags exist—Lesser and Supreme. Lesser Primaeval Hags are reconstituted Hags suffering from lost spell levels; these Hags typically cannot simultaneously consume and redirect magic. Additionally, Lesser Primaeval Hags are incapable of transmuting consumed magic without sufficiently powerful artefacts. Comparatively, Supreme Primaeval Hags can typically cast 8th or 9th level spells; these Hags are capable of simultaneously consuming and redirecting magic and can transmute consumed magic. Occasionally, a Supreme Primaeval Hag empowers a Lesser Primaeval Hag. This union is entirely circumstantial: Supreme Primaeval Hags only empower those Lesser Hags they recognize from past lives.

# Maleficarum: Mechanics

My mechanical presentation of Maleficarum is characterized by the emulation of Counterspell:

&gt;When a creature within 60 feet of the Hag casts a spell, the Hag can use its reaction to consume the magic. The Hag must make a Charisma check; the DC is determined by 10 + the spell level. If the Hag succeeds, the magic is consumed, and the spell fails — cantrips are always consumed. Additionally, if the Hag succeeds it can redirect the spell at an applicable target using an appropriate spell slot. The Hag must make a Charisma check contested by the spellcaster's spell save DC. On a success, the spell is redirected. If the Hag lacks a spell slot of the corresponding level, it cannot redirect the spell.  
&gt;  
&gt;Transmutations of consumed spells include changing the damage type; altering the intention; changing the required saving throw; and altering the area of effect. If a spell customarily targets a single creature, it cannot target multiple creatures. Similarly, if a spell customarily targets multiple creatures, it cannot target a single creature.

Here, Maleficarum is presented typically: all Primaeval Hags are capable of consuming and redirecting spells. Supreme Primaeval Hags can transmute consumed magic, thereby changing the damage type or reversing the intention; healing spells can inflict damage. Auxiliary presentations of Maleficarum are idiosyncratic to Primaeval Hags; these supplemental demonstrations are titled *Maleficium*.

# Maleficium: Wyrd Magic

Where Maleficarum perverts magic, Maleficium expresses a perversion of magic. The precise, recondite technique affording Hags’ the capability of anomalously transmuting magic cannot be replicated. Scholars and erudite spellcasters surmise Primaeval Hags are in fact arcane furnaces: magic is “heated” such that the strings constituting that fragment of the Weave deconstruct. Maleficium reanneals the strings to permute the Weave, thereby producing novel expressions of magic. Realistically, this is merely an abstraction; others conclude each Primaeval Hag rearranges the Weave idiosyncratically. Notably, the technique (or gallery of techniques) may not function identically when permuting personal magic. The “arcane furnace” hypothesis is commonly attributed to the perversion of consumed magic. Many scholars unanimously agree that the personal magic of Primaeval Hags is plausibly sourced from a localized aberration of the Weave. Primaeval Hags are anomalous but insular—violating the laws of magic by existing outside magic.

Moreover, Maleficium allows Primaeval Hags to weave novel spells instantaneously—stringing together choice words can engender virtually any effect. Lesser or “younger” Primaeval Hags demonstrate effort when manifesting unorthodox magic; Supreme or “older” Primaeval Hags can silently weave a cassette of unorthodox spells with a languid flourish of the hand. All Primaeval Hags aggressively guard this specific manifestation of Maleficium. However, enterprising Hags showcase false altruism when creatures like Dragons, Giants, Liches, or Sublunary Hags entreat charity. Often, the price is servitude—here, Primaeval Hags are not unlike common Hags. However, servitude almost exclusively requires the creatures to facilitate the synthesis of more Primaeval Hags. Creatures which expire before fulfilling their obligations are consistently resurrected; death is never a respite.

&gt;  
&gt;On a success, nothing happens.

If you’re familiar with Shakespeare, you’re plausibly familiar with the Wayward Sisters from *Macbeth*. The three witches approximate the Greek Fates or Norse Norns, divine female entities of immense power who govern destiny. Even the gods are subject to the Fates or Norns’ visions; the universe is spun and unspun by the sisters. The word *wyrd* roughly translates as “to become” or “come to pass”; the inescapable whimsy of destiny. Presumably, *wyrd* originates from these goddesses whose decrees were absolute.

My titling of Maleficium as Wyrd Magic is wholly intentional: just as destiny is irrepressible, so is the entropic nature of magic. The Weave is a modern conceptualization which softens and ameliorates the essence of the arcane. Spellcasters are envisioned plucking the strings of the Weave to harmonize its arcane resonance. However, magic is neither ordered nor generous; it is accessible only because it is as much a physical property of the universe as heat or sound. Thus, this ordered mechanism of casting violates the abstruse laws of magic. Primaeval Hags, then, are the consequence of magic returning to an entropic state. Like the Fates and Norns, Primaeval Hags too weave the fate of the multiverse—disordered and unconstrained. Primaeval Hags are neither good nor evil: they are impartial, true embodiments of chaos.

Maleficium, or Wyrd Magic, is also demonstrated by a trademark instrument crafted by all Primaeval Hags: Syzygy, the reordering of celestial bodies to rewrite the Weave.

# Syzygy: Even Wyrder

&gt;*Ring, legendary (requires attunement by any spellcaster)*  
&gt;  
&gt;Once per day, a spellcaster may invest a single spell slot of any level in this ring. At any point during the day, the attuned spellcaster can invoke the aberrant, abstruse powers of Maleficium to engender syzygy in the multiverse. The spellcaster can cast any spell from any spell list using their invested spell slot. The spell level is determined by the invested spell slot.

Syzygy is the linear alignment of triplicate or multiple celestial bodies. If you’re familiar with the eponymous X-Files episode, two teenage girls received devastating telekinetic powers during a syzygy event. This ring forces celestial bodies in the multiverse to align, thereby restructuring the Weave to focus ambient magic. Forced syzygy emphasizes and facilitates the aberrant activity of magic, thereby manifesting regional effects. Until the invested spell slot is expended, strange arcane effects promulgate throughout the area. Activating the ring forces syzygy anywhere in the multiverse: a spellcaster on the Prime Material Plane can engender syzygy in the Feywild or Plane of Water or the Tartarian Depths of Carceri.

Crafting Syzygy (the ring is named after the eponymous event) requires colossal effort and energy. A Primaeval Hag condenses a fragment of the Weave until it crystallizes; three crystals of identical size and morphology are always produced. The ring itself is fashioned from the Hag’s aberrant essence, with its hair or flesh commonly used as a material focus. The ring is then inlaid with the crystals at equilateral points. The finished product is indistinguishable from an exquisite claw ring with quartz crystals: amethyst, citrine, and rose quartz, in that order. When activated, a dazzling array of purples and yellows and pinks and rose red blinds everyone except the spellcaster.

Despite the effort required, Primaeval Hags liberally dispense Syzygy to other creatures. The activation of the ring induces the same aberrant activity birthing Primaeval Hags. Repeated use of a single ring eventually propagates a Primaeval Hag—repeated use of multiple rings across the multiverse can propagate hundreds or thousands of Primaeval Hags.

Assuming the ring forces syzygy on the Prime Material Plane, and assuming the area affected is localized to a 1000-yard radius, we can enumerate 10 possible effects. We can then assemble these effects in a rollable table:

&amp;#x200B;

|***d10***|***Effects***|
|:-|:-|
|1|Rifts to the Outer Planes open at multiple points in the area.|
|2|All lingering spirits are made manifest; ghosts can physically interact with the world.|
|3|All affected creatures switch bodies with another creature within 15 feet.|
|4|The intentions of all spells are reversed: healing spells inflict damage and damaging spells now heal. If a spell restricts movement or clouds the mind, it now doubles movement or heightens intelligence.|
|5|The Prime Material Plane and Shadowfell switch coordinates in the multiverse. Affected creatures are transported to the Shadowfell; creatures in the Shadowfell at corresponding locations are transported to the Material Plane.|
|6|All Tiny and Small objects and creatures become Gargantuan.|
|7|Gravity is reversed in the area.|
|8|Rifts to the Far Realm open at multiple points in the area.|
|9|Time is reversed. All affected creatures are aware of the reversal.|
|10|All affected spellcasters switch spell lists and spellcasting rules: Bards &amp; Warlocks; Sorcerers &amp; Wizards; Clerics &amp; Druids; Paladins &amp; Rangers; Arcane Tricksters &amp; Eldritch Knights|

&amp;#x200B;

# Gehenna, Servant of Sa’eer: A Case Study

Below, I'll outline my approach to implementing Maleficarum and Maleficium. I almost always use a Hag statblock as a template; here, my template is the Night Hag.

Gehenna is a Lesser Primaeval Hag who hungrily studies Giantborn; those individuals transmuted by extraplanar radiation when Giant ships shatter planar veils. Giantborn possesses strange, elusive arcane features that include the ability to manifest a specific spell once per day. Gehenna wishes to reverse-engineer the magic responsible for Giantborn. It masquerades as a Fallen Aasimar Sorceress named Gehenna, luring Giantborn to its lair by falsely promising to cure them. Ultimately, Gehenna wishes to elevate its power by liberating Sa’eer, or the Queen of the Burning Garden—a colossally powerful Primaeval Hag sequestered in Pandemonium.

Previously, this Primaeval Hag was destroyed seven years ago by an adventuring party whose leader was a Fallen Aasimar Sorceress named Gehenna. Now reconstituted, the Hag systematically slaughtered the retired adventurers; it brutalized the Sorceress, assuming her identity. Originally capable of casting 9th level spells, Gehenna is presently limited to casting 6th level spells.

Gehenna cannot consume and redirect spells simultaneously: it must expend its action and corresponding spell slot to manifest Maleficarum. Moreover, it cannot transmute consumed spells, preventing it from healing its minions with *Fireball* or necrotizing enemies with *Healing Word*.

Gehenna's Maleficium manifests as the metabolizing and cannibalizing of magic. Notably, Gehenna's youth precludes it from accessing the devastating magic demonstrated by older Primaeval Hags. Thus, its Maleficium primarily supplements Gehenna rather than directly harming enemies. Moreover, it cannot consume and redirect spells simultaneously: it must expend its action and corresponding spell slot to manifest Maleficarum.

I’m making two changes to the standard Night Hag: first, it receives the Multiattack feature allowing it to make two Claw attacks; secondly, I’m replacing *Ray of Sickness* with *Chaos Bolt*, which Gehenna can cast at-will as a 1st level spell. I deliberately afforded it Multiattack as I want it to be equally threatening in physical combat. Gehenna is anything but a glass cannon: like all Primaeval Hags, its unmatched arcane powers bolster its strength.

Gehenna’s Maleficium is manifested using an action after it consumes a spell:

* Gehenna reinforces its Claw attacks. If the consumed spell deals damage, Gehenna adds half the total damage to each of its Claw attacks.
* Gehenna bolsters its physicality. It casts *haste* as the spell, requiring Concentration checks when suffering damage.
* Gehenna infuses its magic. It can use one of the Sorcerer's Metamagic options when casting a spell.
* Gehenna fortifies itself. It erects an arcane ward which provides temporary Hit Points equal to twice the consumed spell level. Using its bonus action, Gehenna can unleash the energy constituting the ward as a beam; it makes a ranged spell attack and the target suffers damage equal to the remaining Hit Points.

Now, I need to crystallize the abstrusely arcane nature of Gehenna. I use Lair and Legendary Actions to present Gehenna as a formidable threat; battling a Primaeval Hag is easy but surviving a Primaeval Hag is extraordinary. First, I need to define its Lair Actions:

* Gehenna forges a psychosomatic rapport with one creature it can see. The target must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, Gehenna and the target share damage; when one is attacked, the other takes equivalent psychic damage. This rapport dissolves at the beginning of the next round.
* Gehenna rolls a d6 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.

Where Sublunary Hags require bitter partnerships to access terrific powers, a Primaeval Hag can singularly decimate its enemies. Thus, Gehenna’s lair supplements its magic rather than emphasizing its power. Specifically, it occupies an abandoned suite of cavern chambers previously used by the Zhentarim as a trade network. Its lair is a terminal chamber which originally served as an ossuary. Gehenna infused the stalagmites and stalactites with power magic; now, the speleothems function as arcane lodestones capable of recharging the Hag. Moreover, Gehenna can tether souls to these arcane lodestones to weave sympathetic magic. Destroying the infused speleothems removes one of Gehenna’s Lair Actions but it unleashes the charged magic. The consequences range from beneficial to deleterious to catastrophic.

Next, I need to define its Legendary Actions:

*  Gehenna and one creature or object it can see within 30 feet swap places (Costs 1 Action).
*  Gehenna casts *Chaos Bolt* (Costs 1 Action).
*  Gehenna telekinetically catapults up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet. Each target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a target is catapulted 30 feet away, takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone. On a success, a target is catapulted 15 feet away (Costs 2 Actions).
*  Gehenna traps one creature it can see within 60 feet in a nightmare demiplane. The target must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, its soul is trapped, and its body is unconscious. Its soul returns at the end of Gehenna’s turn. On a success, the target’s soul is unharmed, and it takes 2d4 psychic damage (Costs 3 Actions).

Finally, Gehenna can use its action to cannibalize the magic charging the lodestones. It acknowledges this as a last resort, as it possesses a finite quantity of lodestones. When the final lodestone is cannibalized, Gehenna loses its Lair Actions. When a lodestone is cannibalized, Gehenna heals itself by metabolizing the infused magic. The initial lodestone restores 6d8 Hit Points; each subsequent lodestone reduces the quantity of Hit Die by 1. Cannibalizing a lodestone supercharges Gehenna, briefly paralyzing its perversion of magic. When a lodestone is consumed, Gehenna cannot access its Maleficarum or Legendary Actions until the beginning of its next turn.

Alternatively, I might allow Gehenna to cannibalize enemy spell slots. A target it can see that fails on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw loses a spell slot of 1d6 level. It suffers necrotic damage equivalent to the spell slot level multiplied by its Hit Die: if the target is a Wizard and Gehenna rolls a 4, the Wizard suffers 4d6 necrotic damage. In turn, Gehenna heals 4d8 points; however, it cannot use its Lair or Legendary Actions until the beginning of its next turn. As this can heavily (and unfairly) neutralize spellcasters, I would limit this cannibalization to twice per day.

# Conclusion

Primaeval Hags are arcane aberrations, twisting the essence and laws of magic without repercussions. As monsters, their activities and reputations unnerve scholars and terrify spellcasters. As enemies, they are wholly intended to consternate the characters. Primaeval Hags are not fair: they do not abide by any rules, and the Weave cannot abjure the Hags’ perversion of magic. Thus, Primaeval Hags are intended to serve as memorably terrifying BBEGs requiring meticulous strategies to defeat. Alternatively, these Hags can assist parties; the Hags’ contributions are as whimsical and recondite as their essence. Ultimately, Primaeval Hags reinforce the inscrutable nature of magic, relaying to characters that magic is not beholden to any recognizable laws or principles.",1,"Maleficarum &amp; Maleficium; or, Putting the Wyrd in Weird Magic"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,47,169,"Knowledge/recall checks are boring, but unfortunately the PHB doesn't give much guidance on how to use Intelligence for anything else. It's pretty common for everyone but Wizards to dump Int hard, and then allow *players* to project their own intelligence into their *characters* when necessary. Would a group of five Int 8 murder hobos really be able to come up with a good plan to infiltrate a hobgoblin war camp? Unlikely!

Here are some ideas for how to use Intelligence with all the skills in the PHB, along with some bonus applications at the end.

Skill | Applications
----| ----
Acrobatics | Hire the best dancers. Discern whether or not a group of bystanders can safely cross a damaged bridge. Discern how a physical maneuver is performed. (Lots of overlap with Intelligence (Atheltics).)
Animal Handling | Identify the best horse in the stable. Jury-rig a harness for a wagon. Drive a herd of cattle to market. Interpret animal communication.
Arcana | Other than knowledge checks: win an argument about magic, establish status in an arcane hierarchy, investigate the site of a magical disaster, write a book about magic, teach magic.
Athletics | Move a heavy/awkward load through otherwise impossible terrain. Work as a construction foreman. Create a dance routine. (Lots of overlap with Intelligence (Acrobatics).)
Deception | Impersonate or deceive a knowledge-based profession: librarian, teacher, engineer, bureaucrat, priest. Gain access to related buildings or resources.
History | Other than knowledge checks: win a cultural argument (history, economics, philosophy, etc.), establish status as a scholar, write a cultural book, publish a newspaper, teach culture.
Insight | Analyze a logical argument. Find the weakness in a lawsuit. Forensic accounting.
Intimidation | Blackmail scheme. Position soldiers in a threatening way. Threaten someone's intellectual reputation or status. Argue on the internet.
Investigation | Already a fantastic Intelligence skill! Use it more. Anything you can't notice just by looking at the surface should be Investigation, not Perception.
Medicine | Characterize/predict the progression of a new disease and identify a cure. Mass-produce a cure. Develop a plan to stop a plague.
Nature | Other than knowledge checks: win a nature/science argument (physics, chemistry, biology), establish status as a scientist, write a nature book, design a zoo, teach science.
Perception | Perceive mental ""somethings"" rather than physical. The surface-level version of Intelligence (Insight) above. Identify the monster's weakness during combat. ""There's something fishy about that record in the archive...""
Performance | Write music, plays, or political speeches. Choreograph a performance. Direct a play, parade, or spectacle. Run a theater. Great ways to spend excess gold!
Persuasion | Persuasion in knowledge-based situations: negotiate a treaty, loan, or contract; convince a jury, investigator, or noble of some line of reasoning.
Religion | Other than knowledge checks: win a theological argument, establish status in a religious hierarchy, write a religious book, run a temple, teach religion.
Sleight of Hand | Identify who stole your purse, hide something small on your person, teach street urchins how to pick pockets, create an impressive stage illusion.
Stealth | Create a plan to infiltrate the hobgoblin camp, rob the museum, or exfiltrate the princess; rig the plate armor, wagon, or ship to be temporarily stealthy.
Survival | For whatever reason, Survival is the hardest because of how it synergizes with Nature. Any ideas?

Additional uses for Intelligence:

* Many of the skill applications above involve creating a plan. While the characters are executing the plan, roll the Intelligence check and on a success give the characters one or more ""inspirations"" to spend for advantage during the execution.
* Intelligence for ""to hit"" and ""damage"" during analytical combat. For example, you can run a legal trial as if each side has ""hit points"", and they make Intelligence-based attacks against each other to see who wins.
* Intelligence instead of Dexterity for initiative in mental combat / games.
* Intelligence check for creating and solving riddles, and winning riddling contests.

In conclusion, Intelligence can be far more useful and entertaining in your game that you might expect. The ideas above will enable new character concepts that some players will really enjoy.",1,Intelligence is for more than boring knowledge checks!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,98,700,"Since diamonds are required for a multitude of spells (from the 1st-level Chromatic Orb all the way to the 25,000 gp True Resurrection), I'm often asked by players about the rarity of diamonds and how to determine their gp cost. So, I threw together a little chart to help them understand how to assess and price their diamonds, for ease of spellcasting. This chart assumes this is the quality/amount needed for casting the spell, which allows you to make diamonds more or less expensive in the actual market.

Quality | Pouch of Dust | 1/2 inch Diameter | 1 inch diameter | 2 inch diameter | 3 inch diameter |
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Muddy | 10 gp | 25 gp | 50 gp | 100 gp | 500 gp
Opaque | 25 gp | 50 gp | 100 gp | 500 gp | 1,000 gp
Clear | 50 gp | 100 gp | 500 gp | 1,000 gp | 5,000 gp
Shiny | 100 gp | 500 gp | 1,000 gp | 5,000 gp | 10,000 gp
Flawless | 500 gp | 1,000 gp | 5,000 gp | 10,000 gp | 25,000 gp

This table provides a way to speak about diamonds in world terms: rather than saying ""you need to buy 1000 gp worth of diamonds"", you can say ""you're looking for a diamond of decent size and some clarity. The diamond merchant has a few specimen that would qualify, the cheapest being a fist-sized diamond that looks fairly opaque. However, smaller diamonds of higher quality would also work."" Since the ""cost"" of the diamonds is removed from your description, you can even set the diamonds at different prices and allow the players to haggle without fear of breaking the spell requirements.

This setup also allows you to place certain limits on in-game play that can curb those pesky resurrection spells. For instance, Shiny and Flawless diamonds might only be sold in a distant part of the world, or be subject to dwarven tax laws. You could set up a quest for diamond merchants to protect shipments and get paid in diamonds.

Other quests that could result from this system include:

* Characters could be charged with collecting diamonds for a noble's Raise Dead spell, needing to hit a certain amount within 10 days. However, their requests are noticed in the markets and merchants suspect they are competitors, sending thugs to ""assess"" the characters' intentions.
* A boss monster could have diamonds as their eyes, claws, or heart without breaking the game by giving the characters excess gold. However, rumors of the diamond-hearted beast would surely draw the greed of certain adventurers.
* A gnome believes she's discovered a way to purify diamonds, moving them from muddy to clear quality. She needs lots of diamonds to test on, promising a share of the profits if she is successful.
* A diamond mine has been infested by hobgoblins, and the characters are tasked with clearing it out. If the party thief pockets a few diamonds, they are of muddy quality and don't cause excess wealth disparity

Hopefully this is helpful for your game!",1,Sensible Pricing and Quality for Diamonds
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,21,235,"This is my second post in the ""Spells &amp; Storytelling"" series, which I began with [a review of cantrips in D&amp;D 5th Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9ras26/how_cantrips_changed_the_world_spells/).  Please refer to that first post for an overview of my thoughts regarding set &amp; setting as pertaining to magic, and the goal of this series overall.  

While I originally intended for this to be a ""Tier 1 spells"" to include 1st through 3rd level spells, a review of just the 1st level spells resulted in quite a few characters in itself. As such, it looks like I'll be doing a post for each spell level!

Generally speaking, these are spells which are under-valued when you read any of the online class guides. These tend to rank spells in order of their effectiveness. Part of my inspiration for this series is to prove that these rankings are at best misleading, as any spell can have its uses, particularly by NPCs in your world - even if your entire point of playing D&amp;D is to run through fantasy combat scenarios.

For each spell I'm giving a basic review of information which I think isn't commonly considered with the spell. To get the full storytelling potential of each spell, one should take this information, and consider what kind of plot hooks, bizarre incidents and other encounters might take place given what I've written here. To go through all of those possible scenarios would take me at *least* twice as long, and my initial goal here is to simply get through and outline each spell's potential.

That said, let's get into the nitty-gritty of looking at 1st-level spells, evaluating their affects on setting, and their storytelling potential!

# MAGIC OF THE FIRST LEVEL

[ABSORB ELEMENTS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/absorb-elements)

* While this spell is commonly used as an elemental shield by combat mages, its utility in day-to-day life as a material enchantment is immense.
* Pairs very well with the ""Control Element"" cantrips in creating magic-industrial processes.
* Absorb Elements can be used to reduce the impact of, as well as channel all forms of elemental energy. This is particularly the case in large urban settings where magic is prominent and technology is more widely available (DM discretion).  Some examples:
   * Industrial uses. Absorb and transfer heat to automate basic black-smithing, particularly for common items like nails/screws/bolts, knives and utensils, and basic equipment. 
   * Create highly insulated surfaces to keep out the cold or heat. Cold/Heat can be transferred from windows for refrigeration and cooking or stored for later use. 
   * Make very effective magical barriers that resist elemental attacks. Doors, chests, and castle walls may all be imbued with adaptable Absorb enchantments to reduce incoming damage.
   * Elemental barriers and channels are commonly featured on Wizard Towers to transfer the power of storms, particularly powerful winds and lightning, to fuel arcane research. Versions of this are also used to protect buildings from powerful storms.
   * Absorb Elements could be used creatively to fashion interesting aqueducts and levies that are even more resistant to flooding, and can more easily direct the flow of elemental water as needed - particularly when used in conjunction with Shape Water cantrips.
* This effective use of such enchantments may require the use of special materials to gain the intended effects. As such, the acquisition or creation of those materials may in itself create new economic demands, and perhaps even adventuring opportunities.

[ALARM](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/alarm)

* Extremely common and important spell when it comes to magical security, this spell is vital in urban areas. With a high demand, many professional spell-casters make a living on creative uses of this single spell (though it's commonly paired with Contingencies, traps, and other enchantments).
* The presence of alarm systems often separates lower and upper/middle class neighborhoods. The poor tend not to have magical alarm systems.
* Many thieves specialize in detecting and dispelling magical alarms. A perpetual arms-race exists to maintain security systems, and also to hack them!
   * Example: Alarm is in place. Thief uses Detect magic to see the boundary of the alarm. Thief uses Dispel Magic to remove the alarm. A Contingency Counterspell goes off, canceling the dispel magic of the Thief. Another contingency goes off, triggering an alternate Alarm, that the house is being hacked!

[ANIMAL FRIENDSHIP](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship) \+ [BEAST BOND](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/beast-bond) \+ [SPEAK WITH ANIMALS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-animals)

* Since each casting of *Animal Friendship* lasts 24 hours, this spell allows for the domestication of an incredible variety of beasts which are otherwise quite dangerous, or not particularly useful to humanoids.
* Societies where Druidism is common feature systems of animal charming to maximize benefits of these spells and to manage the creatures properly.
* While some creatures can semi-permanently be enchanted in this manner, it's often preferred that such creatures be utilized temporarily to gain their benefits, then released back into the wild. This is to prevent accidents, but to also minimize impacts on the creatures. Animals may be abused in some settings in this manner, however.
* Typically animals will be captured or lured to a place where charming will take place in a low-risk environment. Frequently, the cantrip *Friends* will be cast on creatures first, to increase the likelihood of a successful charming. Then *Animal Friendship* will be secured. The creature may then change hands, and the spells *Beast Bond* and *Speak With Animals* are used to communicate the needs of the enchanter. By the time the spell wears off, the animal will be in a controlled environment where its potential hostility won't harm anyone. Many druids may pamper the creature prior to the spells wearing off, to minimize any negative effects of the charming.
* The ability to telepathically communicate orders to a tamed creature also increases the effectiveness of their domestication dramatically (in the form of the *Beast Bond* spell).  
* Some examples:
   * Giant spiders can be domesticated to produce large amounts of high-quality silk for clothing, traps, and containers.
   * Giant badgers, bears, and other martial beasts can be domesticated as very effective guard dogs, sniffers, and even laborers.
   * Massive reptiles can be domesticated as beasts of burden and protectors in swamp-lands, jungles, and other hard-to-navigate regions.

[CEREMONY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ceremony)

* Many clerics and paladins can make a living by utilizing ceremonial rituals to perform all manner of holy rites throughout the lands.
* Those who suffer the many forms of PTSD and aren't themselves anymore can receive Atonement and be restored to their normal selves.
* Water can be blessed fairly easily and turned into holy water, with magical properties.
* Other ceremonies such as Coming of Age, Dedications, Weddings, and Funeral Rites all have their uses, with a high demand in both small villages and large cities.
* In places with corruption, Funeral Rites can be especially important to prevent the rise of Undead.
* Some priests may travel from town-to-town enacting such ceremonies for their orders, while others may do so for profit or donations to a cause.

[COLOR SPRAY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/color-spray) \+ [GREASE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/grease)

* Popular non-violent security measures and criminal deterrents, used in traps, alarm systems, as well as by town guards to keep the peace.
* Color Spray wands and Grease Potions are a high-demand utility devices for highway and town patrols to grant them a basic form of reliable crowd-control.  
* Rather than having only martial solutions to their problems, such patrols may blind and knock down a group of agitators, tie them up, question everyone, arrest brigands, or simply wait for emotions to calm. Such patrols have been known colloquially as Dazzlers, Flashers, or simply Blinders.
* Towns and roadways utilizing such methods are frequently more safe and see much-reduced crime rates.

[COMPREHEND LANGUAGES](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages)

* Bards and other spellcasters with this ritual ability have a high demand in royal courts as well as merchant houses doing business in a variety of places.
* With this spell, one needs not have learned any other language to communicate with others. 
* Due to the prevalence of this spell in some societies, colleges and academies have fewer programs focusing on the learning of languages. Exceptions to this would be for the purposes of creating Art (writing novels, poems and the like), Histories, and the Grammars necessary to utilize language effectively.
* Interpreters in some places may have a great deal of power, able to twist and bend words and phrases slightly between communicating parties to manipulate opinion and behavior according to their whims. As such, those who utilize Comprehend Languages may be held to a very high standard of trust and loyalty to those they serve, frequently having to undergo Zones of Truth to ensure their integrity.

[CREATE OR DESTROY WATER](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/create-or-destroy-water)

* An absolutely vital spell in many places with an incredibly high demand, especially in arid environments, or otherwise places with less fresh water (due to pollution, corruption, or otherwise).
* With each casting, 10 gallons of fresh water are created, enough to support a family for a day. Enchanters able to imbue this spell in large basins may charge nobles a considerable fee for them to have a reliable source of daily water. Lower-class folk may have to spend a years' worth of silver and gold to have such a luxury, but it's always worth the money.
* Vital on expeditions where fresh water sources aren't guaranteed.
* Ability to create rain over small garden and crop plots means more consistent crop yields in places where clerics and druids are available to cast it. This has reduced many forms of superstition relating to the rains, though Druids and Clerics who utilize it often call attention to the spirits from which they draw their power.
* Power struggles are frequent when it comes to this spell. While some may be paid a fair penny to create water, others may be paid to destroy the water of their competitors, destabilizing crops. May also be used to form a water racket, hiking up the price of fresh water since these druids can control the flow.

[CURE WOUNDS](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds)

* As with the Spare the Dying cantrip, Cure Wounds and other healing spells revolutionize health-care in the world, as well as the politics of it.
* While Spare the Dying may be cast readily to prevent death, Cure Wounds can only be provided a certain number of times per day. Accordingly, it's most often reserved for those who can pay for it.
* This puts Cure Wounds, the most common healing spell, *at the fulcrum of social inequality in most D&amp;D worlds.* While at most the common folk can pray to be *Spared*, they often must watch on as their children and loved ones continue to suffer from crippling disabilities, while nobles may treat their bodies with very little respect, knowing full well that after a day of abuse, they may simply be healed. 
* Healing is also quite important politically. Thieves Guilds may make deals with or threats upon healers to ensure assassinations aren't negated. Politicians and firebrands may ensure access to this spell to protect themselves and their assets. The promise of healing services to local town-folk, particularly in places frequently raided by monsters, is often used as a means of gaining political support.

[DETECT EVIL AND GOOD](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-evil-and-good) \+ [PROTECTION FROM EVIL AND GOOD](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good)

* These spells are the bread-and-butter of monsters hunters across the land, not only allowing them to detect the presence of a wide-variety of often-dangerous creatures while patrolling towns, ruins and roadways, but granting them powerful benefits to assist them in destroying said creatures.
* The name of the spell is a bit of a misnomer, as it doesn't specifically detect evil or good. Instead, it detects certain types of creatures: fey, undead, celestials, undead, fiends, and aberrations.
* Hunters are usually professionally trained, and often specialized to find specific types of creatures. This is due to some limits of the above spells, particularly that they only last 10 minutes, and work within 30 feet. This means that hunters need to be able to effectively track down said creatures, to get within range for the spells to be effective.
* The most common hunters are actually those who track Faeries, present not only in small villages, but in expansive cities where they find many opportunities to cause chaos. Hunters of the Undead and Aberrations are also fairly common, though such creatures themselves are usually less prevalent than the ubiquitous fey (depending, of course, on the setting!). However, townsfolk and others are even more thankful to have such hunters around when they're needed, and accordingly they're paid a higher price. 
* Those who hunt elementals and fiends are less common, but still vital in some circles. Druidic townships may have more elemental problems, as well as those doing more dungeon-delving or exploring old ruins.
* Fiend-hunters are perhaps the least common, in no small part due to the fact that their quarry are the most insidious and intelligent of all evil creatures. Of those who exist, very few are known of openly as to protect their identities, and to ensure they're not hunted down themselves. Due to this, fiend-hunters often work for personal reasons rather than profit, and are just as likely to work for favors and boons as they are payments in gold.
* This spell is commonly used by Diviners to prevent the incursion of *Familiars*, who count as celestial, fey or fiendish creatures. Alarms can be setup to detect the presence of a familiar, that might be spying on a house in the middle of the night!

[DETECT MAGIC](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic)

* A ubiquitous spell of incredibly value, this single spell consumes the lives of many mages throughout the realms.
* Aurans, Diviners, Seers - their names are varied, but their purpose is the same: To investigate and identify the presence and nature of magic in a wide variety of settings, for as many reasons as there are hues of color in the visible (and invisible) spectrums.
* Counter-actively, the prevalence of this spell has created an opposing profession: those who are able to obfuscate magical effects, and mislead those attempting to see the nature of a given magic, for a variety of usually-nefarious reasons (aka, Obfuscators).
* Since the spell reveals an Aura, the colors corresponding to the type or school of magic, many academies focus entirely on the various branches that spells fall into. [Many mages spend their entire lives on the sole endeavor of identifying magic, its sources, and effects](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/66qas1/mapping_out_magic_how_the_schools_work_and_what/). Even if a mage is able to determine that an enchantment is of the Abjuration school, for example, only trained eyes can determine how such magic was placed, and what will occur if said magic is triggered. Even fewer can explain the source of Abjuration magic itself, and how it specifically relates to the other schools of magic in the Arcane Weave!
* Objuscators are often employed at a variety of levels. Security professionals who setup alarms will often obfuscate their enchantments, to make it more difficult for thieves to dispel protections on a home, for example. Obfuscators may also try to hide enchantments placed on certain items, such as gloves, rings and cloaks, so that items may not gain notice of guards within a royal court. The highest paid Obfuscators may even be able to hide the presence of an individual entirely from any form of divination.
* Those attempting to hide magic effects may also utilize some limits of the spell, particularly by utilizing certain construction methods. If it can be afforded, homes or specific rooms are often shielded using large stone blocks at least 1 foot deep, 1 inch metal walls, or separately entirely in sub-basements utilizing the surrounding earth to obfuscate. Boxes and other items may be coated in lead as well to obfuscate magical effects. Thieves guilds commonly employ craftsfolk who specialize in such endeavors and hide their works from the authorities, since this is often a sign that someone is trying to hide something.
* Since the spell may be cast as a ritual, one would expect that folk throughout the realms are at versed in the schools of magic on at least a basic level. Discussion of magic auras and their meanings would likewise be quite common even in the most remote villages, though a lack of education may lead to folk being manipulated.

[DETECT POISON AND DISEASE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-poison-and-disease)

* While the spell is often disregarded by adventuring types, the ability to detect poison, poisonous creatures, and most importantly disease, is vital to the health of any settlement, and a necessary part of any good town healer's repertoire.
* A ritual of Detect Poison and Disease is frequently the first method of diagnosis from a town healer, as it allows them to quickly isolate the cause and even the source of someone's ailments. After this magical diagnosis takes place, cures and other treatments can be more readily provided.
* In many townships, the presence of this magic has prevented outbreaks of disease, since it allows healers to quickly isolate those who are infected. Even if they're not able to be treated, the spread of the disease can be halted.
* Particularly nefarious individuals take this spell into account when attempting to enact their plots. Chemists have been known to be employed to create ailments that are not technically poisons or diseases, but are instead magical effects. To the horror of many healers, such magical illnesses elude their detection and diagnosis. Thankfully, they're far less common.
* The ability to detect poisonous creatures also serves other professions extremely well - especially those of the exterminator, and the hunter/gatherer. Snakes, scorpions, spiders and other bugs can be detected anywhere in or around a home, and dealt with accordingly. Hunter/gatherers looking for certain poisons in the wild are able to use this spell to hone in on their quarry to great effect, who then sell venoms, herbs both to healers and poisoners alike for a good profit.

[DISGUISE SELF](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self)

* The bane of many a town guardsperson, this spell is frequently used in larger cities, mostly serving in the arenas of crime and politics.
* Thieves and brigands commonly use Disguise Self after stealing or committing violence to far more easily lose themselves in a crowd. They may also maintain a disguise while performing the crime so that their true form is never reported.
* In the realms of society and politics, it's fairly common for nobles and interlopers to pose as other people with Disguise Self. This is to produce slanderous rumors, to offend high houses, enhance blackmail scenarios, make social threats, and all manner of other dramas. Such plots often have disastrous consequences, just as often for the Disguiser as with their intended victims.
* Accordingly, in high-societies, doormen are often tasked to ensure no disguises are present by patting down anyone who comes in, looking specifically for such illusions. Since the disguise doesn't hold up to physical inspection, this is often a must. This is often a culturally-influenced procedure. Some would say more crass cultures have no qualms with a harsh pat-down, up to and including touching an individual's face to ensure they are who they say they are. More refined or uppity folk may eschew such measures, and they instead rely on Diviners to detect the presence of such illusions at their gatherings.
* The most effective magically-enhanced disguises, particularly those of the political sort, employ not only illusion but costumes, effective make-up to alter the contours of the face and body, stilts to change an individual's height, the use of accents, and obfuscation measures to prevent their subtle illusions from being detected. Accordingly, such individuals require years of physical and intellectual training, and are contracted at quite a high price. For those looking to undermine a particular noble house, however, such a service could be invaluable.

[EXPEDITIOUS RETREAT](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/expeditious-retreat) \+ [LONGSTRIDER](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/longstrider)\+ [JUMP](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/jump)

* The spell *Expeditious Retreat* is often a misnomer, as it's more frequently used to *get somewhere* or more *towards* something, rather than retreat away from it. As such, it's often called *Minor Haste* or simply *Expedition* instead.
* Messengers, Heralds, Thieves, Spies, Guards, Bounty Hunters, Performers and many others all employ this spell to more quickly reach their destinations, as it effectively allows them to move twice as fast as normal.
* *Expediters* accordingly have a high-demand, especially in large cities, focusing on the casting of this spell in as many ways as possible, both with their own magical abilities, and with the effective use of scrolls. Since it must be used on the *self*, those who use it must know the spell, or they must have a scroll, often created by an Expediter, to use when needed.
* To further enhance the effectiveness of *Expedition / Minor Haste,* the spell *Longstrider* is often paired with it, granting most folk a 25% enhancement to their movement (based on 30ft/round). For those who may already run at a higher pace (see: Rogues), Longstrider still maintains a demand to further improve their pace.
* Similarly, the spell *Jump* may be employed, allowing creatures to leap from rooftop to rooftop at incredible speeds, avoiding pursuers, or simply taking perfect shortcuts as the needs permit.

[FEATHER FALL](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/feather-fall)

* While adventurers may see this spell simply as a means to prevent death-by-pit-trap, it has a variety of uses outside of the dungeon. Similar to *Expeditious Retreat* it's accordingly known also as *Minor Flight* or simply *Glide.*
* Most commonly, Feather Fall is employed by explorers, druids, scouts, thieves and town guards to safely glide sometimes vast distances in a small amount of time. Such folk are trained, as it requires a bit of practice to get the timing correct, but it effectively creates a unique form of transportation for very little magical overhead cost.
* Typically, an individual, and even a group, must climb to a certain height. For example, up to 5 town guards frequently reside in a tall tower near the center of their jurisdiction. Upon hearing of trouble (often aided by the Sending or Message spells), *Feather Fall* is cast on them, they leap from the tower, and glide down to their destination.
* Thieves also employ this gliding effect to get over tall walls, and infiltrate buildings from the rooftops. Accordingly, those who seek good security will also ensure their dwellings and courtyards are protected from aerial incursion, or simply built in a manner to prevent it.

[FIND FAMILIAR](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar)

* A classic spell throughout the realms, *Familiars* in some towns are as prevalent as house-cats and other domesticated animals.
* Since familiars are completely loyal to an individual and may persist for quite some time, they're just as likely to be employed by common folk as they are mages, adventurers, spies, and other high-society types. Households will frequently save up silver and gold to purchase a *Find Familiar* scroll, which will produce a long-lasting and incredibly useful pet to serve the family.
* Due to a master's ability to telepathically link to their familiar, this is a favored spell by anyone who needs to do a bit of spying. 
* In high-society this may be prevented in some measure by security, diviners and the like. However, it's often more difficult to prevent the incursion of a familiar than it is to prevent a disguised illusionist entry to a home. Accordingly, some neighborhoods completely outlaw bats, cats, crabs, frogs, and all manner of small creatures that may be familiars, and streets and alleyways are regularly patrolled by exterminators looking for them.
* In most places, however, familiars allows folk to cause all manner of chaos and ruckus. Neighbors may commonly spy on one another or gain entry in their tiny animal forms. In areas where this may be the case, windows, doors and hearths are secured even more than usual, with a sort of arms-race in places where local tensions are particularly high. The ability for a familiar to become a very small spider makes this a particularly annoying and/or curious endeavor for some.
* Some folk of an existential bent have been known to spend more time ""in"" their familiars than in their own bodies, addicted to the rush and the varied experience of cohabiting these magical creatures. While this may be looked down upon in some places, in others it's embraced as a hobby and a way of life. At *Critter Parties* or gatherings, invitees all come to socialize in the forms of their favorite familiars, a confusing and wondrous sight to behold.

[FLOATING DISK](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/tensers-floating-disk) \+ [UNSEEN SERVANT](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/unseen-servant)

* A spell once again commonly disregarded by most adventurers (though named after one), floating discs offer many practical uses in society.
* Floating discs are favored by anyone commonly moving moderate amounts of goods and materials relatively short distances. Merchants, crafts-folk, farmers, caravan owners, miners, and soldiers all have a demand for this spell.
* The presence of floating discs also reduces the need for domestic animals like oxen and horses for those who can readily summon them. Mages just beginning to make their way in the world often rely on this demand to make a baseline amount of pay before branching out into more glamorous pursuits, though the work is likely looked down upon by the more prestigious.
* Various ingenious uses of these strange planes of force enable extraordinary feats. In mining and construction, since the plane is able to bear up to 500 lbs of weight, certain contraptions involving ropes and pulley have been invented that allow an individual to effectively lift or pull far more than they could otherwise. Loads of ore can be lifted up mine-shafts, walls can be more easily demolished with precision, and even human elevators have been known to be powered by such devices.
* Discs are also often employed by thieves to silently carry off large amounts of goods from their victims' homes and businesses, to great effect.
* Illusionists and performers have also been known to employ floating discs both for entertainment and manipulation, dressing up the discs to look like ghosts, or to use them as props in royal plays where such magical ingenuity is usually rewarded.
* The spell *Unseen Servant* is used in a very similar manner, though it's capabilities and limitations are slightly different. Since it's a ritual spell, *Servants* are quite a bit more common than floating discs, and are more prevalent around homes and businesses rather than being used for more industrious purposes.

[GOODBERRY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/goodberry)\+ [PURIFY FOOD AND DRINK](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/purify-food-and-drink)

* While adventurers tend to see the basic healing effects of the Goodberry as its main benefit, their ability to provide 24 hours of nourishment to up to 10 creatures is extremely valuable to society.
* A druid's ability to create goodberries in itself ensures they have an accepted role in nearly any town or village throughout the realms, barring only those who see such magics with a wary eye. A druid is commonly given a safe haven, a warm hearth, and other protection, so long as they provide goodberries to local townfolk as needs permit.
* Goodberries have been used to great effect, first in Elven armies where druidic soldiers were more prevalent. This allowed generals to eschew common limitations that providing food for soldiers usually entails, though the casting of the spells needed to be managed effectively as to not drain druids of their magical resources when the needs arose.
* While their nutritional benefit is indisputable, goodberries aren't always known for their great flavor. Indeed, the taste of a berry is said to be flavored by the individual who creates them. When casting the spell, a druid who is filled with care and love may produce juicy and deliciously sweet and even savory berries that can be used in a variety of recipes, to the delight of those who eat them, while a resentful druid may produce quite bitter fruits.
* The spell *Purify Food and Drink* has many similar impacts as goodberry, as it can be used to ensure that food provided to troops and townsfolk is free of any disease-inducing elements. 
* *Purify* is often employed by generals, politicians and arch-mages to ensure their food is never the source of their own assassination.

[IDENTIFY](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify)

* While the spell is often a must-have for adventurers and those who frequent upon magic items, Identify is a bit less prevalent to common folk.
* In the same manner that Detect Magic is used to enhance security, especially in the upper echelons of society, Identify is used to verify questionable items, even if they're coated with lead.
* Where Detect Poison and Disease fails to diagnose magical ailments, Identify can be used to do that specifically. As such, the most skilled healers are trained in the use of both spells in order to diagnose any ailment that exists in the multiverse.

[ILLUSORY SCRIPT](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/illusory-script)

* Similar to Disguise Self, this spell is favored by criminals, nobles and the military, who place a high value on the security of their information.
* While the presence of Illusory Script could be found with Detect Magic, the hidden script itself cannot be deciphered. Since one of the only means of seeing the hidden script is the use of Truesight, a much more powerful spell, Illusory Script is often an extremely secure method of communicating secrets.
* Illusory Scripts can be written with relative ease, with a ritual casting time of only a minute, making it a favored method for writing secret directions to locations in alleyways and city walls. 
* Sometimes illusory scripts are written specifically to enhance paranoia, and throw folks off the trail of what may lie in plain sight.

[SHIELD](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield)

* Most commonly known by adventurers as a spell that alters combat situations, the most ingenious of abjuration enchanters have been able to utilize this spell to create wards with great utility in everyday life.
* In conjunction with security measures and Contingency spells, Shield can ensure that particularly important objects are secured from damage. Historical artifacts, important family heirlooms, and great works of art are most frequently imbued with Shield enchantments to prevent damage from accidents, or outright attempts to destroy them.
* Important windows and doorways may also be enchanted in such a manner, though other spells are more commonly used. As such, this less-common enchantment tends to cost a bit more than standard spells.
* Shield cyphers are commonly made and sold to anyone who may need extra personal security, and are of particular demand by town guards and the military. These are commonly squeezed, crushed, or thrown at the ground in the event of violence, and are then consumed. 

[SILENT IMAGE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silent-image)

* As per the *Minor Illusion* cantrip, this spell is a favorite of thieves, charlatans, as well as artists and designers.
* Larger images and sounds can be created for dramatic scenes in performances. This is particularly useful when telling stories featuring bizarre creatures like Trolls and even Dragons that require both sound, movement, and take up much more space than minor illusions.
* Artificers can form more powerful illusions with *Silent Image* to create more prominent effects. These are usually for specific events, or attached to *Contingency* spells for a specific purpose. Some examples might be:
* An illusion as part of a celebration, holiday ritual, or important religious ceremony
* A high-impact magical advertisement using both sound and light to attract business
* A much more convincing security measure, such as a monstrous creature confronting a thief who has broken into a manor.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,11,69,"**History:** 


 About 150 years ago, Tieflings weren't exactly in a good state. Distrusted by, if not everyone, then at least quite a few people, and persecuted by more then a few.... *overly fervent* followers of the deities, they had to deal with quite a fair bit of trouble. However, that eventually changed. A group of friends, each one a experienced adventurer, set out to find a place where they didn't have to deal with the prejudice of others. They picked up more and more comrades, and by the time the group grew large enough to make a decent settlement, they found a rather large island, one just tropical enough for a group wide preference towards warmth. The group decided on settling on the coast, after clearing out what monsters were there of course, and begun a city that would eventually become Niehohm. Over time, word spread, and more tieflings, as as well as other social outcasts,came to join the city. It grew, and eventually caught the attention of kingdoms nearby. Though the burgeoning nation was able to settle most of the issues that arose from this attention, one king in particular refused to let things go peacefully, at least not without making sure *he* controlled Neihohm. He sent his army to bring the city's citizens to heel, and from that erupted a war. Surprisingly, they held out, bringing to bear magic, cleverness, and steel in defense of their home. The general, eager to vent his spleen and increasingly desperate to spare himself the humiliation of being beaten by nothing but a city, launched attack upon attack. Eventually, he happened upon a particularly cruel and, in hindsight, foolish plan. He made a large team from his best fighters and magic wielders, and, one dark night, sent them to abduct as many children as they could. It was one last attempt to gain a bargaining chip that'd shake the city. As could probably be expected, it didn't work out as planned, for this was the night that proved to the world that Neihohm wasn't going anywhere.


 The citizens reacted in fury, and chased the team out of the city and across the island,attempting to bring what few hostages they could get back home. As they were doing that, a bronze dragon that'd been watching the war had had enough, and chased the general's fleet away with blasts of repulsion energy and wave sized splashes. As the Neihohm folk picked off the kidnappers one by one, they eventually cornered what was left in grassy plains near the center of the island. One of the original founders was filled with fury at this cowardly attack towards the most defenseless and innocent of them, and as the rest attacked the other kidnappers she engaged the most powerful magic user of them, a warlock who'd made a pact with a particularly nasty fiend, in a duel of spells. Fortunately she was a skilled sorcerer in her own right,and won after a great struggle. However, by the time the titantic battle was done, much of the plains had been rendered into a desert, one that'll be unnaturally warm for hundreds of years to come. Thankfully, all the children were saved without much harm, and the exhausted, wounded heroes limped home. From there, the war ended, and the king that'd started the trouble decided it would be wise to be diplomatic, especially after the haggard general ranted to him about being chased off by a dragon. As time went on, the city became the capital and primary port of a small nation spanning across the island, and now it's known for being a place to stop and rest from a long journey across the sea.


**Culture:** 


 The dwellers of Neihohm come from all over, and so the culture is a well mixed and quite colorful mishmash of various traditions and habits. One overlying theme is a wish to enjoy the freedom from hate and fear, and so many citizens have a city wide fondness for relaxing and having fun. As such, musicians and other entertainers are quite popular, and true bards are greatly respected for their ability to mix a talent for entertainment with magic. There's also a wide fondness for stories, and many of the citizens can read and write with relative ease, something further aided by the adventuring roots embedded deep into Neihohm's history as well as a great deal of schools. All in all, the arts are well loved in Neihohm, and advancing perhaps just a little faster then most places thanks to the wide degree of parent cultures are mixing together to create new, interesting things. Despite the easy going nature of the city, many of the native Neihohm citizens also have a very strong protectiveness towards children, inherited from the events of that historic night, and threatening, let alone harming, a child is a **strictly** enforced taboo. 

 Thanks to a large concentration of Tieflings, there's a wide preference towards saunas and hotsprings. The  architecture is, for the most part, designed to take advantage of the tropical wind that blows through the city as well as as the warm sun, with large windows and walls designed to hold the heat in. Of course, being that the city is on the coast this doesn't stop things from getting cold, and there's a equally wide preference towards either lots of covers or magic that helps keep things warm. Whether the buildings are designed to Tiefling preferences towards warmth or towards other specifications, they tend to be brightly colored, and well decorated. 


 As for clothing, it is just as varied as the people who visit Neihohm. However, there does seem to be a common type of clothing among native born Tieflings, and that is a preference towards either wide necked or wrap around tunics and robes, as well as skirts. This is probably born from the hassle of designing pants and shirts meant to fit around large tails and horns (and perhaps even wings and modified appendages), and how uncomfortable these garments are when worn. Despite, in theory, being simple garments, they are still usually brightly colored, and sometimes decorated with pleasing patterns. Native Tieflings also seem to enjoy decorating their horns and tails in a variety of ways.


 Though the holidays that various citizens celebrate are too many to count, there are a couple of ones celebrated commonly enough to mention. One is Children's Day/General's Folly Night, a event dedicated to that historic night. During day, school and work is let off, and various entertainment centers are filled with child friendly events so that the kids and their parents can enjoy a day of relaxation. At night, a parade forms, and as the citizens celebrate a paper mache caricature of the infamous General is marched to the beach before being launched and sent skipping across the ocean via magic. The other holiday dates back to the beginnings of Neihohm, and is somewhat less child friendly. It is called Dancer's Night, and despite the innocent seeming name it is a city wide, somewhat hedonistic party celebrating the freedom to be themselves. Music and laughter fill the air as all of the citizens put on their best finery and go out to play (after making sure the children are asleep and won't be disturbed, of course.) The taverns and eateries throw open their doors and lower their prices, and so the drink and food flow aplenty. Not only is this a earnest celebration of their home and the joy it brings them, but it is also quite a draw to various tourists. Both of these holidays happen once a year.


**Religion and Magic:**


 Much like holidays, there are quite a few religions  practiced by various citizens,and thus there are a wide degree of churches available. One overlying theme however is worship of Good deities. These are usually ones of family and/or children, art, knowledge, and luck, with a few ones of the sea thrown in for good measure. While worship of Neutral Deities is common enough to be witnessed, worship of Evil ones is strictly forbidden. Clerics are common, and, perhaps a bit ironically, a noticeable degree of native Tieflings that set out to adventure are either these or paladins.

 As for magic, there is a certain casualness about using it, and spells and magical trinkets are common enough. As expected from this, there are quite a few magic users in the city, and sorcerers are just as respected as bards. There is also a noticeable degree of warlocks, though making pacts with fiendish beings is, much like the worship of Evil deities, strictly forbidden. There are two reasons for both of these. The first is that they don't want the trouble it would bring if the other nations noticed and reacted in fear. The second is that it is not just wrong in general principle, but a outright Bad Idea to mess about with forces that would happily destroy all that is good if they could.

**Economy:**

 They haven't many products to send that aren't common enough elsewhere, perhaps a few fruits and the fish in the surrounding waters, but one big export is culture. Art, knowledge, songs, plays, you name it they share it. Tourism is also a big money earner. The original settlers were lucky enough to find a place close enough to most of the major sailing routes that captains started stopping by, and over time the routes started including Neihohm as a stop on the long journey across the waves. For this reason, Niehohm is known as being one of the Cultural Capitals of the known world, and they have a strong economy based on this. They also ship out magical trinkets that can't commonly be found elsewhere, from children's toys to handy little things that adventuring sorts like.


**Factions:**


*The Council:* Not exactly eager to have just one person in charge of the whole thing, the original settlers got together and talked about it, eventually agreeing upon a democratic model. This became the Council, a group of decision makers drawn from and chosen by the citizens via polls and elections (ones made to be honest via magic that makes it so only truth is spoken and chosen.) There are the Talkers, a group of people who discuss laws and governance,and the High Speaker, a person in who carries out the laws decided by the rest of the council.The High Speaker is meant to be the wisest and most compassionate member of the Council, so that they can do what is best for the small nation's citizens. They are also expected to be the one who meets with visiting royalty, and so they must also be clever with their tongues and able to be diplomatic. This model of government *has* had a few kinks and mishaps, but nothing that hasn't been easily worked out. 

*The Hellfire Crows:* A group of Tieflings who believe that Niehohm shouldn't just stop at saying 'we're Tieflings, and that's alright.' Instead, they say, all of Niehohm should take that pride in ones self even further, indulging in the 'heritage' that their fiendish 'ancestors' left for them. They are closely watched to ensure they don't take things further then words, and generally regarded as annoying but harmless extremists. That said, there are rumors that they manage to slip past the Watch's gaze and indulge in despicable rites.


*The Bronze Guardians Adventurer's Guild:* A guild of heroes and adventurers aligned with the forces of good, it has branches in various other nations but makes it's home in Neihohm. Members of the guild are recognizable by large, bronze brooches and badges worked into the shape of a shield, various gems and symbols indicating the member's rank. They are known for working close with the Watch to help guard the citizens of the city. So close that it is commonly accepted that being confronted by a Guardian is akin to being confronted by a officer of the Watch. In fact, retired Guardians often take up a secondary profession as Watch trainers. The guild is also known for it's practice of making wards of the children who lose parents to a adventure, and they are housed in the HQ where they have lots of aunts and uncles to help raise and protect them.  The Guildmaster is 'secretly' the very same dragon who helped guard Niehohm so long ago, and regards his guild members, especially the young Wards,  as part of his Hoard. As such, you can expect the HQ to be *very* well guarded indeed, and it's commonly accepted to be one of the best places for a child to be raised.


*The Silken Flowers:* A coalition of those who handle the more... *sultry* professions and entertainments, they work with the authorities to make sure that those who work in said professions stay safe, and have the best care available.  As such, to be rough with those who work under a Flower is to ask for a 'thorn' somewhere unpleasant before being taken away to the cells. 


*The Mind-full Ones:* Despite the slightly teasing nickname, they are a group of the most respected scholars and entertainers, and help handle both the various schools and more educated entertainments,such as operas and story telling centers/libraries. There are at least a few wizards and bards in this group.


*The Bilge Rats:* Every civilization and every city has those who would rather indulge in crime to make ends meet, and Neihohm is no different. The Rats are a group of criminals who handle many of the seedy things in the city, and **especially** smuggling. As could be expected, they've clashed with both the Watch and the Guardians quite a few times.


*The Rat Hounds:* A joint venture between the Watch and the Bronze Guardians, this is a team formed by the more roguish members of each, meant to hunt down the Rats once and for all. You can expect those experienced with stealth, investigation, and crime to be here, and fully intending to take that knowledge to punish the criminals that plague the underbelly of the city.

# BTS tell me about the districts found in the City of Gandahar!",1,The City of Gandahar: Districts Megathread
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,48,851,"One of my most favorite roles as the Dungeon Master is creating the Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG). This is the villain entire campaigns strive towards, a person that is simultaneously sympathetic and beyond saving. These are your Magnetos, Darth Vaders, and Jokers. The BBEG is the driving force behind the campaign, the glue between the party. And yet, as much as I enjoy the villain, creating a compelling and exciting villain is incredibly difficult. Trying to create someone who is personally tied to each of the players, the foil to the heroes, and is more than just a mustache-twirling puppy kicker is something I and many other people struggle with. I know I personally haven't ever made a villain that compares to these cultural icons, but today I am going to try to dissect the process and see what makes a good villain for Dnd. 


#The Foil

One aspect that is apparent for all of the great villains in history is how they are the foil to the hero. Batman is law while the Joker is chaos, Xavier wants equality Magneto wants dominion. Creating a foil to the hero is a very powerful way to create a compelling conflict that can last for a long time. The problem with Dnd, however, is we have more than one hero. We are not writing a story where Luke can face off against Darth Vader alone, we have a game where the entire party is going to face the BBEG at the same time, and all members should be equally invested in the final conflict. Considering most parties can be aptly described as a misfit group of adventurers, creating a foil for this kind of group can be very difficult. 

There are a few different methods we can follow to establish a foil for the party. The first method is by identifying a common theme amongst the party. If everyone in the party tends towards a chaotic bent, creating a villain who is focused on the law can create someone who the party will despise. This common theme doesn't have to be exclusive to the party's alignment either. If the parties goals are as simple as acquiring treasure, a villain who opposes that common goal (either through stealing the treasure from them, or using taxes to extort it from them) is someone who the party will rally together to destroy.



Another method for creating a foil to the party is to create individual foils for each character and combine it all into one person. Sometimes this may not be a viable route, as a party composed of Lawful Good Cleric, and Chaotic Evil Barbarian may create a foil that is pulled in too many directions, but if done successfully it can create a character who is nuanced and unique. You could also take the individual foils of each character, and split them up into a group of villains who all counteract individual players. 

Finally, you can also choose to make the villain a foil to the world itself. For example in a world focused on light and happiness, having a villain raise a legion of undead armies would be a natural foil to the world. As the players go through a campaign, they can meet several NPC's who are foils to the villain which the villain can then put in danger. Even though the composition of the party may change dramatically over the course of the game, the world will always reflect the villain and tell the players why they need to be stopped.

#The Villain Demands Change

*""You can’t have an impotent villain. Those people are just philosophers."" *

(http://www.outrightgeekery.com/2013/10/31/d-d-campaign-building-101-villains/)

I really love this line from Outright Geekery in their article on building villains. A villain with a moral philosophy that contradicts the party and foils them is great and all, but without the bite and drive to follow through on anything he says, well, they just end up becoming an NPC with radical ideas. A villain is someone who is in a position of power and is willing to make change. Maybe they don't start in a position of power when the campaign starts, but by the end of the campaign, your players better be facing someone who demands respect.

It can't just be that they are powerful though. A lazy monarch could have the power to rule the world but will choose not to. The villain is someone who demands change and will do everything they can to get it. This desire to get what they want/deserve is ultimately what will turn them into a villain. They will go to any length because what the change they have envisioned is more important than anything else. This is the kind of person you can sympathize with, but can't agree with. Thanos makes an excellent villain in the MCU because he believes that his cause is worth it no matter the loss. His idea is extreme, and his reasoning is loose (just double the resources), but he is a person with power and is someone who demands change. That is what makes him a great villain, no matter what they may believe in. 

One final thing I want to note about villains is that they believe that they are the hero of the story. Another reason why Infinity War works so well as a movie is because they frame Thanos as the hero. The movie goes through the hero's journey for Thanos and shows us why he believes he is the hero. The audience may not agree with him, but he believes it and to him, that is all that matters. Your villains should believe in their goals as much as Thanos believes in wiping out half of the universe. 

#Conclusion

Creating a compelling villain is as simple as following 3 different steps. First, make them a foil to the heroes or to the world itself. Second, give them the drive and means to exact out a plan. They want change in the world, and they will go through anyone and anything to get it, no matter the personal cost. Finally, make them the hero of their story. They wouldn't go to such extreme lengths if they didn't think what they were doing was right.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,94,"Hello! You know what the problem with wild magic is, in my opinion? Not wild enough! I sought to remedy this by adding 50 new options to the original 50 items on the PHB Wild Magic Table in order to create a very much expanded 1d100 table for you to roll! I thought I'd share this list and let you steal it for your own campaigns if you so desire!

Please note, I think it would be best if this list isn't shared with the player like it is in the PHB. A lot of the fun of this list comes from them not fully understanding what the effect really is, a few effects rely on them needing to figure out what just happened.

1.	Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
2.	The spell the caster was about to cast alongside this automatically fails. Any concentration spells the Caster currently had still active are now dispelled. The caster loses the ability to cast any subsequent spells for the next 10 minutes. (Changed at high demand) 
3.	For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. 
4.	All of your teeth fall out of your mouth, and slowly regrow in 10 minutes.
5.	A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears I minute later.
6.	You cast Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.
7.	You cast Magic Missile as a 5th-level spell.
8.	Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow.
9.	You cast Confusion centered on yourself.
10.	You create a 10 foot wide portal in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you which leads to a random layer of the Nine Hells. It remains open for 1 minute.
11.	For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns.
12.	The caster is charmed, and madly in love with the first humanoid creature they see. This infatuation lasts for 1 hour or until a spell that ends the charmed effect is cast. 
13.	You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face.
14.	You have a brief vision of the future, giving you one use of the Divination Wizard’s Portent feature. It must be used within the next hour or be wasted.
15.	You cast Grease centered on yourself.
16.	You and all creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become stunned for 1 minute. Stunned creatures may retry the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect early on a success.
17.	The caster shrinks by one size category for the next minute.
18.	All beasts within 60 feet of you become charmed by you for the next hour.
19.	Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.
20.	The area around you in an 120 foot cylinder reaching 50 feet above is instantly transported into the astral sea, returning after spending 1 minute there. The area floats there, suspended aloft by nothing. Any creature not within the cylinder when the area returns is not returned along with it.
21.	Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A Remove Curse spell can end this effect.
22.	An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
23.	Your head suddenly turns around fully, resting backwards on your shoulders for 1 minute.
24.	You grow tusks which last for 1 hour.
25.	The caster lets out a loud, obnoxious belch which can be heard by any creature within 120 feet. It tastes vaguely of charcoal and bananas.
26.	For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action.
27.	You immediately emit a cone of fire with the same properties as a Gold Dragonborn’s breath weapon. The DC is your spell save DC.
28.	All corpses within 30 feet of you rise as zombies, and attack the closest creature they can see. 
29.	You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see.
30.	You immediately secrete an awful stench. Every creature within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can retry the saving throw at the end of every turn, ending the effect early on a success. This stench lasts for 10 minutes.
31.	You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
32.	All ranged spell attacks directed at the caster reflect off of them and target a random creature instead for 1 minute.
33.	Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute.
34.	Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older.
35.	1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute.
36.	You cast Aura of Life.
37.	The caster’s skin becomes white and smooth like porcelain. For the next minute, the caster has vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
38.	You regain 2d10 hit points.
39.	You cast Spider Climb.
40.	You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.
41.	The nearest creature to you is polymorphed into a perfect clone of yourself for one minute. It gains all of your physical characteristics, but knows none of your skills or abilities otherwise.
42.	For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns.
43.	The caster grows an additional head which lasts for one minute. During that minute, they have advantage on perception checks and saves against being charmed or frightened.
44.	You cast Fear. If there is no target in range of this spell, you target yourself. If this is cast on yourself, you become frightened of the nearest creature.
45.	A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.
46.	Every creature within 60 feet of the caster must make a Wisdom save or drop all items they’re holding.
47.	A small bush sprouts on the ground in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, bearing 10 Goodberries. 
48.	You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth.
49.	A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to Magic Missile.
50.	The caster grows claws for 1 minute, and is able to replace their regular unarmed damage with 1d6 slashing damage for the duration, and are proficient in using these. If the caster already has such claws, roll again on this table. 
51.	You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days.
52.	You are granted the knowledge that you are nothing but a character created by someone for a tabletop role playing game, your every action dictated by this unseen force which brought you into existence. After one minute, you shake this thought off, believing it to be nothing but a small bout of hysterics brought on by wild magic.
53.	Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours.
54.	You cast Speak with Plants on yourself.
55.	You cast Antimagic Field, requiring no concentration, that lasts for 1 minute.

57.	You cast Hero’s Feast.
58.	You regain your lowest-level expended spell slot.
59.	The caster is filled with the undeniable, unshakable feeling that they can now cast the Wish spell. Once they attempt to cast it, the only thing that happens is they realize they were misguided.
60.	All non-magical clothing and armour you wear disintegrates.
61.	For the next minute, you must shout when you speak.
62.	Your tongue doubles in size for the next hour.

70.	Each creature within 30 feet of you becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a spell.
71.	You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute.
72.	A random creature within 60 feet of you becomes poisoned for 1d4 hours.
73.	The next time the caster takes elemental damage (Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison), they gain resistance to that type of damage for the next 8 hours.
74.	Your body becomes encased in an armour-like coating of ice. You gain a +2 to AC, but your speed is halved for 1 minute.
75.	You cast Ottiluke’s Irresistable Dance on every creature within 30 feet.
76.	You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn.
77.	You cast Polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration.
78.	Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air within 10 feet of you for the next minute.
79.	You cast Warding Wind.
80.	You cast Levitate on yourself.
81.	You can take one additional action immediately.
82. You instantly take 2d10 necrotic damage. Every creature within 30 feet of you heals damage equal to the sum of the damage you took. 
83.	You create an illusion as if cast through Major Image, creating the image of a Goristro demon in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of yourself. The demon stands there menacingly, roaring at anyone nearby, though it does not move or make any attempts to harm anyone.
84.	Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to the sum of the necrotic damage dealt.
85.	You cast Sanctuary on yourself. 
86.	You cast Mirror Image
87.	The Caster becomes a magnet for magic. All spells cast, or targeted at creatures within 30 feet of the caster instead target the caster. This lasts for 1 minute.
88.	The caster turns into a Mountain Dwarf, retaining as many of their physical characteristics as would make sense during said transformation. They lose all their racial abilities, including stat bonuses, and gain those of the Dwarf, excluding any proficiencies. This lasts for one hour, or until Greater Restoration is cast on them. If the caster is already a Mountain Dwarf, the same above process happens except into a High Elf. 
89.	You summon a storm cloud which hovers 20 feet above you in a 30 foot radius centred on yourself that lasts for one minute. On initiative count 0 (Or every 6 seconds if out of combat) the cloud strikes a random creature in this radius with lightning. That creature makes a dexterity save against the Sorcerer’s spell save DC or take 3d10 lightning damage, taking half as much on a success.
90.	The next time the caster casts a damaging spell, the damage is maxed. 
91.	You cast Fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you.
92.	A door appears on the nearest wall to the caster, leading to the other side of said wall. If there are no walls in sight of the caster, roll on this table again.
93.	You become invisible for the next minute. During that time, other creatures can't hear you. The invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.
94.	If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the Reincarnate spell.
95.	You cast Haste.
96.	Your size increases by one size category for the next minute.
97.	You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute.
98.	You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute.
99.	You regain all expended sorcery points.
100.	The caster learns the location of the nearest legendary magical item, either through a brief vision of it’s location or an approximate distance from their current whereabouts.
",1,My Personal 1d100 Wild Magic Table!
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,142,422,"I think the rules for carrying are simple but too heavy on math, so I decided to make an easier one, less realistic, but more fun.

I made a PDF, [here's the link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15qzzavtuwdUOWz15fzhK2WSjNd9RPQr8), and here is a simplified version just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score. It can be measured in inventory slots. There are 5 category sizes for equipment and each category uses a set amount of slots according to the table.

|Category|Slots|Average Weight|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Very Small|1/4|up to 1 lb.|
|Small|1|up to 10 lbs.|
|Medium|2|up to 30 lbs.|
|Big|3|up to 50 lbs.|
|Very Big|6|up to 80 lbs.|

The category sizes are not defined by the weight, the average weight is just a guide, what should define is mostly common sense. For exemple, most weapons weight between 1lb. and 10 lbs, so all weapons are small, even if a heavy crossbow weights 12 lbs., it should be in the small category because its not that far from it and its easier to just lump all weapons together.

As a guide, very small objects are little handheld itens like vials, coins and holy symbols, small are weapons, books, instruments and most items, medium are backpacks and light armors, big are most armors and very big are canoes.

**Containers**

You can carry more itens by putting them inside containers, a container can carry 10 slots worth of items smaller than itself, backpacks for exemple can carry 10 small items or 40 very small items but no medium items.

**Encumbrance**

Carrying more than your carry limit makes you slower, for every slot beyond your limit, reduce 5 ft. from your  speed, if you are 20 ft. slower, you have disadvantage in you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use physical atributes.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you guys have fun with it. It was inspired by Resident Evil 4 and other encumbrance house rules. Also, the PDF version have some artwork and that makes it 110% more fun so check it out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT (12/4/2018)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Variant:  
You have inventory slots equal to your Strength Score. Shields and every regular weapon uses 1 slot, weapons with the Heavy or Reach Property use 2 slots, light armor also uses 2 slots, medium and heavy armor uses 3 slots, items lighter than 1lb. use 1 slot for every 10x, Containers can carry everything of 1 slot, or 2 slots if attached outside, and as long as it is within the Strength limit. Encumbrance works as above.

&amp;#x200B;

tell me what you prefer.",1,Better rules for carrying capacity and encumbrance
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,32,605,"[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Na5UEm_4zdWTOwYvbYq6T51ObmI6NkU/view?usp=sharing) is the document in question.

I used a combination of homebrew and DMG materials (pg 129 specifically) to design an item creation system that better fit my players and their world.  Specifically, one of mid-low fantasy.  As with most custom materials it allows for quite a bit of DM Discretion if necessary.  The ultimate goal here was to design a system that was easy for players to understand, and for DMs to run.  I find personally that the Item Creation system in the DMG (and what's in XGtE) tends to fall a bit short.  The system here revolves around using spell levels instead of non-specific categories that are used in the books.

Essentially, it takes the monetary pricing and gives it a more (sort of) realistic time scale to work with.  It also allows for layering magical effects and such.  One rule I didn't include was that of multiple crafters: as in the DMG, more than one person can work to craft a magical item at a time.

Let me know what you think, and any constructive criticism you've got.  Thanks in advance!

**Edit**:  There has been a ton of constructive criticism!  I think I've been inspired to write a more in depth and complicated magic item creation system while making some tweaks to this ""simpler"" one.  Obviously there is a lot of room for abuse here and closing some of those power gaps would be ideal.  While ultimately these decisions are left up to us, rules like these should be a foundation and not a bare bones skeleton.  If I make any updates to this I'll make a note here.  If I make a new system or have major updates I'll post a new thread.  Stay tuned!",1,"I designed an alternate method of crafting magic items for my campaign.

# BTS tell me about the factions found in the City of Gandahar",1,The City of Gandahar: Factions Megathread
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,54,1104,"Sometimes the everyday motions of daily life blend together into a forgettable day. But, if you pay close enough attention, sometimes you might notice something that’s a bit…off. Here are d6 things that aren’t as they first appear.

**1 – Shadows**

*The sun is bright after a long day in the town square. Someone walks by you as you look down to get your face out of the sun. You’re startled, as the form of two shadows fighting one another stumble into your view. You look back up, but there’s just one figure – and she continues to stroll down an avenue!*

Shadows can be an excellent way to break the news to your characters that something isn’t quite right. Maybe an NPC doesn’t have a shadow. Maybe a monster’s shadow acts independently. Maybe a PC is cursed, and their shadow is murdering other shadows. Whatever the case, shadows can be a great way to get the point across to your PCs – hey, something is…different.

**2 – Smiles**

*A butcher is furiously working on slabs of meat behind the counter. She doesn’t hear you as you approach – and your greeting startles her. She aggressively turns, surprised. But within a moment, she’s smiling. You can’t help but notice the fangs pushing down past her lower lip…*

Smiles, and teeth in general can introduce a hint of “something isn’t right” to any game. Fangs are the most obvious example, but any small change in a smile will get your PCs thinking. A town where each person is missing their canines? A family whose teeth have all turned black? An NPC who, when angered, shows the teeth of a wolf – but just for a moment. Teeth can be the first clue to a rabbit hole down the supernatural.

**3 – Abnormal Behavior**

*The local magistrate stomps her large white horse through the middle of the street, with a small party trailing behind. Commonfolk hurry to get out of the way – but Casper, the local cobbler, seems frozen in fright. At the last second he’s pulled away by someone nearby. You didn’t realize it at the time, but Casper wasn’t frightened by the magistrate – rather, by the new cleric following closely behind.*

Extreme changes in behavior, especially for less-than-interesting common folk, can easily pique your character’s interest. The local smith never delivers an order (especially one the PCs asked for)? The baker has a violent reaction to a child entering their shop? The pious priest savagely flees from silver? Each of these are odd and extreme behaviors, hinting to something a little more sinister beneath the surface.

**4 – Clues**

*Your mind spins as the pieces slowly begin fitting together. Tattered clothing found in the woods? Dog’s hair found around town? Bite marks on the door of the church? And a full moon approaching? You can’t believe you didn’t see it before – werewolf!*

Your PCs probably know a lot about fantasy and horror tropes – use that to your advantage! Pick a well-defined monster*, and begin dropping clues around town*! It may seem cliche, or even obvious, but sometimes your PCs deserve an easy mystery – especially if it leads to a tough fight!

*Like a sparkly vampire
*Like glitter

**5 – Small Detailed Changes**

*The market is bustling despite the overcast skies above. Merchants are shouting their sales, and children are scurrying about. You check your purse for the fifth time, making sure none of the sticky-fingered youth have received a free meal. Suddenly, the wind picks up, and gusts of wind begin creating dust devils around the market. The loud market quiets momentarily, but within minutes the wind dies down and things resume as normal. It’s odd – it rained earlier, but everything is dry. What’s even more odd, is the same thing happened yesterday at the same time…*

Using changes in the environment of your game can make mundane, errand-style trips into something a bit more intriguing for the PCs. Maybe the bread the PCs are eating as rations is more salty than usual. Maybe the soup has live maggots in it. Maybe all the milk in the tavern has curdled. Maybe weird vines are spotted growing on buildings around town. Small, odd, and repeated details can alert the PCs that things aren’t as they first appear.

**6 – Sense Descriptors**

*The sound of tavern music and jovial conversation fills your ears – but something is off. It’s a smell. You’ve been in taverns before, and you know what they smell like. This one is different. It smells earthy, like something you would smell outside. It’s musty, almost sickly sweet. It takes just a moment more, but you recognize it – manure. Why does the tavern smell like manure?*

Role playing games are so focused on the sense of sight, that often times the other senses are only described when there is a reason to. Try to make a short list of each sense (sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste, etc.) and give at least one descriptor every time the PCs change environment. Then, use a different sense to describe something out of place. Maybe you are hearing a flute as you paddle in the middle of a lake. Maybe you smell manure while in a church. Maybe you feel breath on your neck while in line for a sale, but you turn and no one is there. Using the odd, unexplained, and unexpected with another sense can help your PCs realize that something isn’t just right. ",1,d6 Ways to Let Your Players Know Something Isn’t Right
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,185,1215,"Thinking of magic items that can be found without giving the players too much gold, I came up with a list of 10 items of little actual value (so of about common to lower uncommon value) but that are fun and may lead to interesting very specific uses, and fun rp:

**Amulet of Hindsight**\- You get advantage on checks regarding events in your past.

**Ostentatious Broach**\- When worn, the wearer has the effects of fairy fire cast on their self, with no additional range.

**Misty Key**\- Once per long rest, the user can turn to a mist form for six seconds, during which they may fit through any ~~surface~~   space a creature one size smaller than you can pass through.

**Lagged Dagger**\- A cut by this dagger shows thirty seconds after it strikes. Does normal damage five rounds after striking, and the damage is considered magical.

**Adjustable Weights**\- A small lightweight anvil shaped trinket. Once per day, it can be activated with a command word, upon which it instantly begins to weight half a ton until deactivated or one hour passes.

**Bracers of Speed Reallocation**\- Once per long rest, you may use all of your movement to make an extra melee attack. Requires atunement.

**Cloak of Misplacement**\- An item placed in a pocket of this many-pocketed cloak disappears and appears in another pocket once the hand placing it is removed.

**Orb of Illusion**\- Once per long rest, this orb can be activated to take the effects of minor illusion, cast on the orb. This effect can be activated in your hand and thrown, the illusion activating on impact.  

**Inverse Umbrella**\- When opened, light rain begins to pour down from the inside of the umbrella. This effect can last up to fifteen minutes per day.

**Glasses of Lightvision**\- When worn, the user has the effect of darkvision when in bright light (can see black and white for 60ft).",1,Worthless Fun Magic Items

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,18,46,"*The reckless warlock struck a deal, black-out drunk, with an archfey. He signed a contract without reading it, and his patron gleefully refuses to disclose any details. Not wanting to be subject to his patrons whims, he searches for a way out of his mistake. Through trials and tribulations, he has finally managed to get a hold of his copy of the contract… which is several pages long.*

*With trembling hands, he reads the first page:*
****

&gt; Agreement of Patronage
&gt; 
&gt; The Patron and the undersigned (henceforth referred to as the Parties) agree to the following terms:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Bestowment of powers
&gt;     1. Bestowment of powers detailed in Appendix 1 begins from the moment of signing.
&gt;     2. The Patron agrees to continue bestowment for the full duration of the Agreement.
&gt;     3. The undersigned is given full reign of bestowed powers detailed in Appendix 1, and adheres to limitations detailed in Appendix 2.
&gt; 2. Duration of Agreement
&gt;     1. The Agreement is in power until 
&gt;         1. the death of either Party,
&gt;         2. breach of agreement, or
&gt;         3. mutual termination of the agreement.
&gt;     2. In case of breach of agreement, the Agreement is in power until responsibilities detailed in Appendix 3 have been carried out in full.
&gt;     3. In case of death of the undersigned, the bestowment of powers ends as detailed in Appendix 4, and soul custody is passed immediately to the Patron according to protocol set in Appendices 3 and 4.
&gt;     4. The terms of mutual termination are detailed in Appendix 3.
&gt; 3. This Agreement will not be replaced by any other similar agreements without explicit written consent from both Parties.
&gt; 


****
*Oh, oh no...*

**Why use the Written Contract Approach to Patronage^TM ?**



**Outlining PC/NPC motivation:** 

Whether the warlock read the contract properly or not before signing, it exemplifies what the character valued (or didn't value) at the time. At what cost were they willing to make a deal for powers? Did they think it through? Have their priorities changed after making the decision?

I have used a prop with the agreement above as the warlock pact of a PC that wanted to wriggle out of it, and in another campaign, as a way to expose the motivations of a villainous NPC who wanted immortality at any cost.

**A puzzle for you players:** 

Perhaps there is a loophole in the appendices, and the PCs can beat the fey at their own game?* Throwing pages of dense legalese at the players has proven to be a surprisingly fun and engaging puzzle. 


Especially RP-heavy players and rules lawyers tend to enjoy this puzzle.


**Exposition:** 

A way to show instead of telling!

Based on one page, it it obvious that the fey in this campaign are semantic rules lawyers, warlock pacts are binding and taken seriously, and that crossing a fey (or having the _audacity_ to die) will have dire consequences. What is your patron like? How is that reflected in the pact?

**Controlling the flow of information**: 

Several appendices, each packed with more information. If I wanted to, I could spread these pages around for the PCs to find at appropriate times.


**You are a law student and your players really should have seen this coming**: 

Self-explanatory.



*There is at least one loophole, of course, hidden in the appendices. Here is the one I’m currently banking on them using: &gt;!in appendix 3, it is revealed in the fine print that if the warlock does not actively use the bestowed powers for a certain duration of time, it is an expression of the wish to terminate the agreement. If the Patron during this time does something that could be also seen as a wish to terminate the agreement, voilá! Mutual termination, the agreement ends, no souls necessary. So… time to trick an archfey!&lt;

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,16,"**Deity Name**: Sephora, Goddess of the Void, Queen of Nightmares

**Domains**: The Void, Abhorrent creatures and Aberrations

**Symbol**: A black snake with purple eyes.

**Tenets**: Sephora's tenets are defined by her 8 Daemons; Daemon of Fire, Daemon of Blood, Daemon of Shadow, Daemon of Chaos, Daemon of Fear, Daemon of Destruction, Daemon of War, and Daemon of Solitude. Each Daemon has a specific symbol pertaining to their tenet, listed in the same order as prior; A burning flame, a drop of blood, a shadow of a hooded figure, a maniacally laughing face, a clawed foot, a burning house, a stone warhammer, and a single wooden chair. Each Daemon grants a set of bonuses that will be decided by the DM.

**Beliefs**: Sephora grant powers to those who follow her, and they will become demigods once their world is taken over by her unending horde.

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Allies**: Sephora has no friends.

**Enemies**: Anyone who does not follow Sephora's will is her enemy.

**The Cult**: The Sephora Cult can appear as different political or non-political entities depending on the world, including names such as ""The Black Palace"" or simply ""The Sephora Cult"". There are no temples to Sephora, but instead worship is made wherever and whenever a follower of Sephora decides. In the main Sephora Cult, the members wear a purple cloak that enshrouds their face in darkness and covers their body, so that only their glowing, purple eyes can be seen. The Black Palace uses a similar design, but has Black Knights who wear spikier armour, and have red eyes instead of purple.

**Holidays**:Sephora and her followers do not have holidays, except for when a universe is consumed by her creatures. Then they have an office party. But Ben is not invited.

**Champions**: Sephora does not have a champion of her faith.

**Variations**: A variant following I like to use sometimes is The Black Palace. Instead of being somewhat open about worshiping Sephora, they hide it away, either because of it being illegal where they are, or because of the populace they are around. Normally this would also happen in a scenario where the Black Palace has some sort of power, such as the royal guard of a king, or a mercenary company. In the Black Palace, the cultists themselves are referred to as Black Priests, and are protected by a Black Knight and a Black Knight Novice (on occasion). The Black Knights and their novices are also corrupted by Sephora Daemons, but in a way that they are not physically contorted.

**The Story**: In the area between the universes, where no known gods dwell, lies a place known as the void. Dark, cold, unforgiving nothingness. And within this fearsome realm are creatures of nightmares. Abhorrent, aberrations, terrifying daemons, and a being who rules above them all - Sephora, Queen of Nightmares. All that is known of her entity is that she hungers for power, that of which she draws from the souls of magical mortal beings. The only way she can do this, however, is to have her beasts consume creatures that are not of the void. Unknown universes have fallen to her contamination, and an immeasurable amount more are already infected.
Even so, there remains followers of this dark being. These cultists in most worlds act as gatekeepers, operating something called a ""Sephora Webway"". These gateways commonly act as transportation between two universes, two dimensions, or even long distance travel within the same world. On rare occasion, Sephora Cultists could be persuaded to transport adventurous heroes - or courageous fools. Using this gateway, they build the means to allow Sephora's hordes to invade a universe.

**The Functions**: The Sephora Cult often does not meddle in politics, rather lying in the shadows instead. However, Cultist events could be stumbled upon by players, or a mission could be made to get rid of what is thought to be a Sephora Cultist Gateway.
Sephora Cultists are not like regular people (clearly), they are corrupted, twisted forms of who they used to be, both physically and sometimes mentally. This form, this corruption, is caused by being infested by a Sephora Daemon. These creatures themselves cannot survive outside of the void, which is why they require a host, that being the Cultist they infest. After that, the Cultist can then spread only that specific Daemon to new members, if the new members are willing. When a character, player or not, joins the Cult, they get to choose one of the eight Daemons of Sephora to be infested with.
Sephora Cultists get the power to control Sephora Gateways as well, but all of these powers come at a price. The Sephora Daemon requires souls of magical beings, and to acquire them they must be consumed by the host. Their origin and alignment matter not, just as long as they channel magic through their very being. Creatures who practice magic, but were not born with magical prowess, are not eligible for feasting. 
When a creature is possessed by a Sephora Daemon, their eyes glow purple and their physical body contorts to fit the daemon within. Their body is then enshrouded in darkness.
Any creature possessed by a Sephora Daemon is immune to magical effects, and cannot use magic unless they have consumed recently. For a creature that does not consume their requirement, refer to the DnD exhaustion chart or make one of your own.

Sephora was my first creation for DnD, and my favorite. I left alot of the numbers, stats, and charts out because those can be changed up depending on the DM and the campaign difficulty. 
Sephora herself is the first of a number of beings I call ""Shadow Beings"", and I do intend on making more in the future.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,13,83,"Hey everyone! This was a thing I came up with a long time ago, and originally posted it to r/DnD
I’ve just started a Curse of Strahd campaign, and I’ve been putting it to use for the first time in a long time. Thought I might share it with my fellow DMs. See if anyone likes it
(This is a copy and paste of my original post)


Foreword: As someone whose second most played RPG is Call of Cthulhu, I’ve always been interested in trying to make a sanity system. I’m currently running Tomb of Annihilation for my group, which is an adventure with sudden death at the hands of horrible monsters feels like it could happen at any moment. During our last session, our group of five was reduced to a group of one. Since that happened, I decided to make a Sanity score to roll against things like watching the rest of your party die at the hands of a Medusa and being forced to run.
To test it out, I ran a one-shot solo adventure for our sole survivor (a tabaxi fighter named Shady Bit) and threw some disturbing stuff at him. So far it works well without being unfair and he enjoys it. I’ll see how things go when I’m running a larger group.
I read the section in the DMG about adding a sanity score, and made this system based on some of its suggestions/guidelines. Here you go:


When experiencing events that would test one person’s mental stability, call for a sanity save. The DC of this check is highly circumstantial, but the ratings should follow this basic line.

Strange or discomforting- DC 11
Frightening- DC 14
Deeply disturbing- DC 18
Mind bending horror- DC 22+

As with all checks, don’t throw huge numbers at high level groups unless you are looking for them to seriously suffer. If you’re running a horror-heavy campaign, make them check a lot. If you’re running a game with a more standard DnD tone but want to add an extra level of ‘sometimes you see some horrible things as an adventurer’ (like what I’m doing), don’t feel the need to include it all the time.

Sanity score = (Int + Cha)/2
If you are proficient in Int or Cha saves, the score increases by 1 (2 for both)
The modifier for the score is the same as that of other stats.
For example, a Rogue with 16 Int and 13 Cha would have a score of 16 (29 divided by two rounded up, +1 for Int save proficiency). As such, he would have a +3 modifier to sanity saves.

Failing a sanity score doesn’t have a set effect, it has a table of effects based on how much the save is failed by:
3 or lower- Character has disadvantage on next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
4 through 8- Character is frightened for 1d4+1 turns
9 or higher- Character drops what they are holding and are stunned for 1 turn
Natural 1- Roll on the ‘Short Term Madness’ table (DMG 259), and character’s Sanity score drops by 1

If a character’s sanity drops three lower than their maximum, roll on the ‘Long Term Madness’ table (DMG 260). At the end of the rolled duration, the character must make another sanity check against the DC of whichever horror dropped their score to 3 below max. They have a bonus to this roll of +1 per 12 hours passed since the event. On a success, they recover. On a fail, they are effected for an additional 1d8 hours (at which point they must make the save again).

If a character’s sanity score is reduced to 5 below their maximum, roll on the ‘Indefinite Madness’ table (DMG 260)

Sanity recovers at a rate of 1 point per week of rest

Additionally, for every ten successful sanity saves, your Sanity raises by 1. If this increases your Sanity past your maximum, it is your new maximum. These are cumulative, so they don’t have be be consecutive. The passage of time or resting does not reduce your progress on these rolls.

Refer to DMG for rules on Curing Madness. Curing madness does not restore lost sanity score.


I hope you guys like it! I’ve run it by a lot of my friends and they think it pretty cool. If you have any suggestions or tweaks let me know, and if you feel like using it leave a comment to tell me how it goes!



Many thanks to u/PantherophisNiger for the Best Mechanic nomination! Nothing feels better than being able to share something that other DMs enjoy",1,Sanity Score
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,54,730,"So last session my players finally signed up for some gladiator fights in Port Nyanzaru's colloseum. While fighting dinosaurs and gladiators was fun, I wanted the mechanics to portray the fact that they had a massive crowd watching them - whether that hypes them up or makes them nervous. As long as the crowd is feeling some **HYPE**, that will make the party fight better, but if the crowd gets bored, that might make the party self conscious. So here's the simple rules I used and later somewhat modified to make them more fluid.

#Before Combat
Before rolling for initiative, give your players one round to entertain the crowd. Let each player roll a Charisma (Performance) check against a DC of 12. For each success, the **HYPE** meter increases by 1 point and for each failure the **HYPE** meter decreases by 1 point. If someone succeeds or fails this check by 5 or more, instead increase or decrease the **HYPE** meter by 2 points.

#Hype meter state
* As long as the number of points on the hype meter is greater than half of the size of the party (rounded up), each member of the party will have advantage on every attack roll.
* If the number of points on the hype meter is a negative value greater than half of the size of the party (rounded up), each member of the party will have disadvantage on every attack roll.

*For example, if the party has 5 members, they would need to maintain 3 points or more to keep the hype going and to keep having advantages. If they drop to -3 points, the crowd loses interest and they get disadvantages instead.*

* EDIT: Alternatively you can ofcourse give them any other buff you deem as appropriate such as +1, +2, +3 modifiers, inspiration, temporary HP or other stuff.

#During Combat
* At the end of each round of combat, starting with the first, the **HYPE** meter loses 1 point.
* Whenever a member of the party is knocked prone or unconscious, the **HYPE** meter loses 1 point.
* At any time during combat, a character may spend an action to attempt a Charisma (Performance) check to increase (or decrease) the **HYPE** meter.
* Whenever a character kills an enemy creature, they can spend a bonus action to attempt a Charisma (Performance) Check to increase (or decrease) the **HYPE** meter.

#After Combat
If at the end of combat the number of points on the **HYPE** meter is still greater than half the size of the party (rounded up), you can consider the fight an amazing show. This might catch:

* The interest of factions who need recruits.
* The eyes of slavers who want to kidnap and sell party members.
* The demands of colloseum masters, who want the party to do more shows.
* The envy or respect of other gladiators.
* And if you're playing Tomb of Annihilation, definetly the interest of Merchat Princes (especially Ekene Afa) and other questgivers.

#FAQ
* No, the check is not limited to only Charisma (Performance). I actually recommend using multiple different checks. Let the party use Intimidation, Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, fuck maybe even Arcana or Animal Handling or any other check you see fit. As long as the player describes it well, I'd allow the check.
* If a player describes a really cool attack, you could let them try to make a hype check as a bonus action.
* The DC I used was only 12 because my party was 2nd level. You can change the DC as appropriate, depending on the size of the crowd, if it's a friendly or a disrespectful crowd, the level of the party etc.
* Yes, most of the time the party should have a positive **HYPE** meter. Yes, this does make them very much stronger. Have fun with it, throw some beefier monsters at them.
* If you want a long fight to let your party fuck around with moves, then use one big enemy creature with very much HP and low dmg, but also throw in a bunch of squishy enemy creatures so the party can keep the **HYPE** meter high by killing them.

I hope this comes in handy for some of you! :D",1,Using HYPE to make colloseum/gladiator fights more engaging and entertaining.

Another god for your D&amp;D campaign! This time, I present to you a god of glorious combat and enlightenment through mastery of the blade. I give you: **Kenka, God of Swords!**

-----

**Name**: Kenka (pronounced KEHN-kah)

**Titles**: The Almightiest

**Divine rank**: Intermediate God

**Position**: God of Swords

**Holy symbol**: A flower composed of swords

**Alignment**: True Neutral

**Cleric alignments**: True Neutral, Lawful Good (Paladins only), Neutral Good, Lawful Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Evil

**Portfolio**: Swords; swordsmen, swordsmiths and their arts; combat, duels, honor

**Domains**: Truth, War, Courage, Forge, Metal (All clerics of Kenka whose chosen domain has *Martial Weapon Proficiency* and *Weapon Focus* possess them with a sword type as their preferred weapon)

**Allies**: Moradin, Gond, Kord, St. Cuthbert, Sune, Tempus, Levistus, Asmodeus

**Enemies**: Bhaal, Olidammara, Mask, Shax

**Favored weapon**: The Sword, any and all kinds

-----

**Appearance**:

The Almightiest cuts an impressive figure. He appears as a man of any race, but always relatively tall for the race he manifests in, wearing long hair held up in a bun and a long, flowing beard, which seems to dance in an unexisting breeze. He dresses in comfortable robes that allow free movement, and he always, of course, carries a sword in a scabbard. However, when he unsheaths the sword, dozens of swords of all kinds and sizes come out, and from there he will choose the one most appropriate for the coming battle. He always wears a calm expression on his face, but his eyes burn with intensity. He speaks little, but when he does, his voice is calm but commanding. If any person in his presence possesses a sword, the sword will start vibrating and ringing, as if shaking in awe at the presence of their god and singing his praises.

-----

**Backstory**:

With the ring of the first hammer beating shape to metal, Kenka was born. Some say literally: many theorize that Kenka was mortal once, and that he was the first to ever forge and wield the sword, the most perfect of all weapons, and he's a god that finds joy in glorious battle. However, unlike other gods of war, Kenka does not seek combat for its own sake, but always according to his beliefs and in search of perfection in technique. To Kenka, the sword is not only a weapon, but a tool in the search of enlightenment. A sword needs not draw blood, but must be wielded with skill and conviction. In searching for perfection in swordsmanship and the forging of swords, a man also forges himself.

According to Kenka's holy texts, the sword is a representation of mortal life. Just as man and woman join and share seed to form new life, a hammer and an anvil join and share base metal to form it into the holiest of all implements. From the forge the sword is born, and through its use it grows. It is chipped and dulled by use, but from this wear and tear the swordsman learns, and when it is repaired, it is made stronger and sharper. Just like all mortals, a sword can die; it can be broken beyond repair or rust away into nothing. However, a sword that has gone though glorious battle and served its master well will be given a place of honor in their trophy case; likewise, a swordsman or swordsmith who dies after a lifetime dedicated to perfection of their calling will be welcomed into Kenka's realm and held to his bosom as a favored child, given divinity as one of his eternal servants and allowed to continue their craft beyond death. They can also choose to reincarnate and go back to the mortal realm, and they instinctively remember the wisdom they developed in their previous life; many prodigies of swordsmanship and swordsmithing were actually followefs of the Almightiest in a previous life who are continuing their work in this life, and they always instinctively return to his worship.

-----

**Dogma, clergy and temples**:

Kenka believes that battle and craft forge a mortal towards perfection. In the forging and wielding of a sword, one finds their true self, and through the perfection of their craft, they grow physically, mentally and spiritually, until the finally surpass mortal limitations and reach enlightenment. While a sword grants power, this power is nothing if not tempered with skill and dedication. An unskilled man with a sword is nothing more than a mere thug, a skilled swordsman has control of both their environment and their own self. Likewise, any blacksmith can beat any hunk of metal into a fascimile of a weapon, but a true master who dedicates themself into making a sword worthy of the name creates a tool that can have a lasting impact on the world. That lovingly crafted blade can do as little as protect a single man or as much as slice off the head of a tyrant and change the course of history, but either way, it has impact.

Followers of the Almightiest fall into two categories: swordsmen and swordsmiths. To Kenka, both paths of mastery are equally important and glorious. A swordsman affects the world through their deeds, as does a swordsmith by proxy through every sword they forge.

Swordsmen belong to one of the martial classes, like Fighters, Barbarians, Rangers, Paladins, Knights, Swashbucklers and Samurai, and even a few Aristocrats and Warriors can feel the call to Kenka's faith. However, a follower of Kenka never belongs to any of the Rogue-related classes; Kenka frowns on underhanded tactics and demands honorable combat. A class that combines magic and combat prowess, such as a Hexblade/Magus, is permitted, as long as the follower limits their magic usage to general combat; a follower may fight a monster or be part a battle and use magic, but any follower that uses any magic in a duel can expect to be shunned by the Almightiest. Of course, any swordsman of Kenka exclusively uses a sword as their melee weapon of choice, and using any other melee weapon is seen as a grave insult against the Almightiest, to the point that any Paladin or combat-focused Cleric that uses any other weapon must perform Atonement. Long range weapons are permitted in general combat, but dueling must be exclusively performed with the sword.

Swordsmiths also belong to the martial classes but they focus on crafting prowess over combat prowess. Swordsmiths can also be adventurers, and they are allowed to use weapons other than the sword for combat (though Kenka of course prefers the sword). However, their weapon forging must focus exclusively on swords; the forging of armor, other weapons or (gods forbid) mundane smithing like shoeing horses, is the purview of blacksmiths outside of Kenka's faith. The forging of the sword is their exclusively assigned form of worship of the Almightiest.

There are those who follow Kenka who go beyond forging and wielding swords, and dedicate their lives to communing with him directly. These are his clerics, and to them, the sword is a metaphor for the ability to act upon the world around you. To a cleric of Kenka, a physical sword, as masterfully as it might be crafted and wielded, pales in comparison to the will that drives both actions and to Kenka's own godly power. They wield divine magic in his name, and to them, every divine spell they cast is a different ""sword"" they can wield against their enemies and make their mark upon the world with. Kenka approves of this philosophy, for he himself says the sword represents mortal life, and thus it can in turn symbolize other concepts as well. This is not to say that Kenka's clerics shun physical swords. Quite the contrary: many of Kenka's clerics are master swordsmen and swordsmiths themselves. They simply see that there is a third path of the sword that can be taken.

Once a swordsman or swordsmith chooses their path, that is generally their calling for life; a swordsman, other than general maintenance, does not forge swords, and a swordsmith seeks perfection on their forging, not their swordplay. Any swordsman or swordsmith that decides to follow the other calling will have a hard time; Kenka frowns on vacillation, and any member of his faith that decides to switch callings and fails is seen as a fool, and they might very well lose his patronage entirely. It is not unheard of for a member of one calling to switch to the other calling and excel, however, and those that do are praised as paragons of wisdom and self-knowledge. There is one instance in which a member of Kenka's faith can change calling without judgement, however: a master swordsman or swordsmith, one who has reached the pinnacle of their art, is allowed to change calling, as it is a sign of utter commitment to the sword in all forms. If a master fails at the other calling, they are not shamed; there is no shame in attempting perfection in a second field when one has already achieved it in a first.

A follower of Kenka who has achieved mastery of their calling is, appropriately, called a Master Swordsman or Master Swordsmith, and the most accomplished living masters in either field are called Grandmasters. Masters and grandmasters are the consummate teachers of their disciplines. Once every generation or two, however, an individual will rise among the Almightiest's faithful that masters both the forging and the wielding of the blade. When such an individual arises, signs and portents manifest that signal them as blessed by Kenka, and they are bestowed the title of Sword Saint. A Sword Saint is considered a herald of Kenka, and it is believed that every action they take is by his whim. Unlike masters and grandmasters, the Sword Saint does not teach; it is folly to think one can achieve the Sword Saint's level of enlightenment by study, one must forge their own path instead.

In all the millenia of existence of Kenka's church, only once has there ever been more than one Sword Saint at a tine, and in that time, the world was amazingly blessed with three, who in time became known as the Three Sword Brothers. The First Brother, titled Sword Savior, was said to be a man of great conviction and inner strength, renowned for the incredible precision of his swordplay. He wielded twin shortswords, and was known to swing with such skill that his enemy would not feel the killing blow until seconds later, when their wounds would open and they would fall into pieces. The Second Brother, named Miracle Sword, was a serene and gentle man who was admired for his agility and grace. He wielded a longsword, and was said to wield it so masterfully that he could kill any opponent without ever inflicting any pain. The Third Brother, known as Sword King, was said to be a mountain of a man possessing great intensity and ambition, who was so strong that he could kill any man with a blow from his bare hands, let alone using a sword. He wielded a massive greatsword, and was said to swing it with such force that the very air burned as he swung, and he could kill hundreds of enemies in a single swing. There are many tales of the Three Sword Brothers, both as individuals and fighting together, and the greatest of these are of the clashes between them, for men as great as them are inevitably destined so. No one living knows which tales about the Brothers are true and which are exaggerations tacked on with the retelling, b what is definitely known is that they did exist, and that their heroic feats have cemented them as the greatest followers of Kenka in all history.

Worship of the Almightiest is a pragmatic affair. While their swordsmanship and swordsmithing takes a ritualistic flair, that's about as far as followers' worship goes in terms of ritual. It is through action that they show their devotion to their god. Temples of the Almightiest are not places for ceremony and prayer: they are schools, dedicated to teaching the forging and wielding of swords. However, these monasteries do espouse perfection in other ways. Worshippers perform exercises to strengthen themselves, eat a healthy diet, meditate and study both lecture of the Almightiest and books on other, more mundane topics. Warriors of Kenka tend to be well-cultured.

Followers of Kenka tend to be well-traveled as well, wandering the world in search of challenges, and well-transited routes often have small roadside shrines to the Almightiest carved in stone or wood by a worshipper passing by. It's also not unusual for certain roadside stops or small towns to become havens for the Almightiest's faithful, with small arenas for competition or local militias willing to hire from his worshippers. These hamlets tend to be interesting places to live in, paradoxically high in violence but low on crime.

**Holy days, celebrations and rituals**:

-**The Baptism of the Sword**: The Baptism is a ritual performed between two followers of the Almightiest's church, a swordsman and a swordsmith. The swordsman commissions the swordsmith to forge them a sword, and the blacksmith obliges. When the weapon is done, both individuals perform a prayer and an oath. The swordsmith swears that the weapon has been forged with the utmost care, making it proud through excellent craftsmanship, and the swordsman swears to make the weapon proud by wielding it with skill and conviction. Both men then proceed to cut their hand with the sword, confirming their oaths with their blood upon the blade.

This ritual is not made lightly: by this ritual, the swordsman and swordsmith are become sworn brothers, the blade representing their bond and their joint goals in life. Such folk often become adventurers together, and there are legends of mighty swordsmen and their swordsmith brothers whose names have risen to glory in their respective crafts of swordsmanship and sword craftsmanship. When one or both of these warriors die, adherents of the Almightiest will look for the blade and bring it to a temple to be retired and consecrated as a holy artifact, one of the greatest honors that can be granted to followers of Kenka.

-**The Duel**: No sacrament of Kenka's faith is taken as seriously as the Duel. The battle between two swordsmen of the Almightiest is no mere battle for glory, it is the clash of two competing personalities and ideologies, using the sword as their tool to prove their way of life superior.

A worshipper of Kenka will not challenge recklessly, and neither will they accept a duel with anyone. When a swordsman is challenged, they will carefully consider their opponent. They will neither accept to duel someone obviously superior or inferior to them, and there is no shame in rejecting such a duel. Admitting someone is obviously superior to yourself is considered wise and humble, as you recognize you still have much to learn and give due deference to those further down the path than you. Likewise, rightly recognizing someone as inferior to you shows confidence in your skill, and gives a reckless challenger the opportunity to grow and challenge at some other time. If the challenge is refused, the challenger MUST comply, as to insist can lead to disaster; if the challenger is obviously superior, they gain nothing in having challenged someone so beneath them and gain infamy as a result, and if they're obviously inferior, they are judged a fool and rightly lose face, if not their life.

Depending on the purpose and disposition of the combatants, the duel can be made until first blood, disarmament, incapacitation or death. Duels til first blood or disarmament are usually done as friendly sparring, a friendly duel between masters or practice between two students. In this kind of duel, there is, at least supposed to be, no ill will between both combatants once the battle is done. A duel to disarmament can also be chosen by the challenged if they believe to be superior or inferior and the challenger presses the issue, as it is a way for the challenged to prove the challenger wrong in the purpose of their duel without loss of life. An inferior challenger who gets disarmed is given a lesson and a chance at bettering themself, while a superior challenger who goes too far and kills the challenged is nothing but a murderer, and will rightfully be hunted down by other members of the Almightiest's church.

Duel to incapacitation is usually done when an issue is at stake and both swordsmen represent opposite sides of it as champions. Many societies can use a duel, for example, to challenge for leadership. It is also used as a duel between two masters to prove which one is better.

A duel to the death is, obviously, absolutely serious business. Simply put, a duel to the death happens when two swordsmen are bitter enemies or one of them has been gravely wronged and death is the only repayment. There is a big difference between combat to the death during war and a duel to the death: killing someone in battle is expected as a part of war and is impersonal beyond the differing ideologies that led to war in the first place, but a duel to the death is completely personal. If a duel to the death is declared, both combatants waive the right to be avenged; whoever is the victor is free from persecution from the losing party's allies.

-----

**Tenets**:

-The sword is the perfect weapon. No battle has ever been won without its presence, and to practice it is to seek enlightenment.

-Your most valuable possession is your sword. Sharpen it, polish it and treat it with respect. To let it rust and dull is to sin. A poor man with a sharp sword is worth more than a noble with a dull one.

-To forge a sword and to wield it is to bless the world. Take pride in your craft and strive to perfect it. Whether through combat or forging, make your sword proud.

-The sword reveals the truth of a man. A good man wields a sword to protect the innocent, while an evil man wields it to cut them down. A lawful man wields it to uphold order, while a chaotic man wields it to defend his freedom.

-Brag not. Actions speak louder than words. Let your sword speak for you and you need not brag, others will sing your praises.

-There is no shame in dying in battle. To die sword in hand is to die true to yourself. If you must retreat, let it be to return to battle the next day.

-The Duel is the ultimate challenge. Do not challenge those obviously superior or inferior to you; if you fail against your better, your own folly has beaten you, and if you beat your lesser, you prove nothing but your ego. Duel not recklessly, but when you do, win.

-If you believe in something, fight for it. A sword wielded with purpose is the strongest of all. Let your beliefs guide your hand, and your sword will strike true.

-----

**Kenka's Paladins' Code**:

-My goal is perfection, and my tool is my sword.

-I do not wield my sword for the cause of justice, I follow the cause of justice so I might wield my sword. By fighting injustice, I hone my skill and seek divinity. I perform my greatest deeds in glorious combat.

-My word is meaningless without action. If I give it, I shall fulfill my promise or die trying. Likewise, my sword is meaningless without action. If Evil makes itself known, I shall cut it down or die trying.

-My sword protects the weak and challenges the strong. I shall bathe my sword in the blood of any who prey on the weak.

-Those who are righteous and wield the sword are my brethren. I shall fight alongside them and train with them, that we may both bask in the Almightiest's light.

-The final mercy I shall grant my enemy is the duel. I shall challenge him and cut him down in honorable combat, and thus he will be redeemed.

-I possess no ego. Every life I save, every feat I accomplish and any enemy I cut down are all reflections of the Almightiest. All glory heaped on me belongs to him 

-----

**Sects and Cults**:

-**The Cardinals**: The Cardinals (named after the compass directions, not the bird) are the four most talented living swordsmiths among Kenka's faithful, each assigned a title according to one of the cardinal directions. Their titles are the North Star, the Southern Cross, the Birthing Dawn and the Dying Dusk. All four of them are Grandmaster level, and their swords are recognized as the finest forged in the world.

-**The Blooddrinker Blades**: The Blooddrinker Blades are a mercenary band of Evil Kenka worshippers who offer their services to the highest bidder. Every one of their members is a master, and every one relishes in combat and bloodshed, seeking to test themself against the champions of their employers' enemies. Rumors abound about the Blades; some whisper that they literally drink the blood of their enemies; some say that they somehow cause the wars they later hire themselves to fight; there's even rumors that their leader is this age's Sword Saint, who seeds chaos in order for the art of swordsmanship to be perfected through bloody combat. What is definitely known is that it is considered a mark of prestige to hire them to fight for you, and that they get results: no army has lost a battle with the Blooddrinker Blades fighting on their side.

-**The Bladed Flower Society**: The Bladed Flower Society is an organization dedicated to the development of the art of swordsmanship through ritual dueling. The Society is quite secretive, and membership to it is solely through invitation. A swordsman who develops a reputation through dueling, given time, will be approached by a swordsman belonging to the Society to offer membership. Once they are sworn in, members of the Society focus their entire career on dueling and forego the usual limitations thereof. They will travel the land getting into as many duels as they are able to raise their reputation and attract strong challengers.

Any member of the society can challenge any other at any time, and their goal is to go up the Society's ranks until they're able to challenge the highest-ranked swordsman of all, given the title of the Flower Cutter. The current Flower Cutter is a halfling woman known for her prowess with a rapier, and witnesses to her prowess claim she's so skilled at her chosen weapon that she's able to call her attacks and perform them flawlessly. She will call out specific body parts, like individual fingers, a specific eye or even a particular inner body part, and will unfailingly hit it with her next stroke. So far, she's held the title for three decades, and most members of the society claim that you should be satisfied with achieving second place, as facing her is a death sentence.

**Allies and enemies**:

Kenka seeks no enemies and courts no allies, he is solely concerned with the sword. However, even in his strict neutrality, he has been able to earn both the trust and the scorn of other deities.

Moradin and Gond both approve of Kenka for his love and respect of good craftsmanship, even if it is solely limited to the craft of swords. Kenka, in turn, appreciates both gods for their pursuit of excellence and honorable demeanor, and greatly admires their skill in crafting swords of great power and delicate detail. Many swords in Kenka's collection have been crafted by either or both gods.

While he disapproves of his Chaotic and Evil followers, St. Cuthbert respects Kenka's neutrality, and Kenka's Lawful followers are recognized by the Cudgel as some of the fiercest defenders of Law outside of his own church. Kenka in turn considers St. Cuthbert honorable, and sees his dedication to his personal code of Law as the type of passion that he wants his followers to espouse, no matter what cause they in turn follow.

Sune sees intense beauty in Kenka. The beautiful craftsmanship he inspires in his swordsmiths, his deep passion and his perfect technique of swordsmanship fill Lady Fairhair with joy, and she often invites him to visit her for conversation and showcases of swordsmanship. Kenka accepts Sune's praise with humble gratitude, and he's willing to oblige her. While Moradin and Gond are the ones who often inspire the creation of his swords, Sune often inspires the scabbards those swords are sheathed in, and the ornamentation in his warrior's armors. While there are some in Sune's church who rumor both gods might be lovers, Kenka's followers mostly disagree, pointing out that their god is much too dedicated to his craft to contemplate love. However, the fact remains that Sune is the one god that the Almightiest interacts with regularly who lacks a martial aspect.

While Tempus is baffled by Kenka's obsession with only one of the many weapons of war, he approves immensely of his philosophy of personal excellence and honor in war, the passion he promotes among his followers and his dedication to martial prowess independent of moral imperative. It is a rare army indeed which lacks followers of either god, and often a battle will have followers of both gods on both sides at the same time. Tempus and Kenka have dueled extensively, and so far they are evenly matched, and they secretly want to keep it that way. Kenka sees Tempus as a true warrior worthy of respect, and Tempus trusts Kenka's word that he does not seek to usurp the title of God of War. While neither god has said so out loud, both gods' worshippers know that they are good friends.

Kenka has a strange but genuine friendship with Levistus, born of their mutual love of swordsmanship. The Almightiest and the Lord of The Fifth were often friendly opponents in dueling, and Levistus would receive the Almightiest as an honored guest of Stygia. Kenka was saddened by Levistus's imprisonment, but he refuses to act on it, recognizing that he has no say or place in infernal politics. As desperate as Levistus is to be freed from his prison, he does not ask Kenka for assistance in being freed, recognizing that involving him would make Kenka a target of all Baator. His refusal to interfere in infernal business and his neutrality have earned Kenka Asmodeus's respect, and the Lord of the Ninth allows Kenka to visit Levistus's prison so that they might talk about the sword. There are also some mortals who follow both Asmodeus and Kenka in equal measure, serving the Lord of The Ninth through martial prowess learned through following the Almightiest, and Asmodeus has great appreciation for these agents' effectiveness.

Bhaal is the antithesis of all Kenka holds dear: he promotes dishonorable combat, assassination and cold-blooded murder. Even Evil worshippers of the Almightiest are offended by Bhaal's worshippers, and will not hesitate to cut them down. Bhaal and his worshippers scoff at Kenka and his faithful, considering them weak and soft for limiting themselves and not winning by any means.

Kenka finds both Olidammara and Mask distasteful. He considers their preference for dirty combat repugnant, while both Olidammara and Mask think Kenka is a stuck-up sucker. Rogues and followers of either god have trouble getting along with followers of Kenka within an adventuring party.

Shax's promotion of cold-blooded torture and delayed death infuriates Kenka. While Kenka does not shy away from killing, he believes that any enemy should be given a quick and honorable death, and no undue joy should be taken from their passing. Kenka is also disgusted by Shax's willingness to kill the weak and defenseless: if a person is no threat to your life, they do not deserve death. Meanwhile, Shax indulges in giving victims undignified, slow and painful death, enjoying their screams and pleas for release. When rumors of Shax's influence reach the ears of a follower of Kenka, they will hunt and cut down the killer promptly.

**NAMES AND TITLES:** Omesu; Great Teacher; Omesu Absent-Minded

Omesu is generally viewed favorably by mortals. He has very few wrathful qualities, and few mortals have ever wronged him enough to earn his ire. 

Because of his warm reputation among mortals, Omesu has gathered a few titles that serve more as nicknames than as proper godly titles. When their tools break or a device malfunctions, laborers and craftspeople may say that “Old Mes” is chiding them for sloppy work. Children may know this deity as **“Omesu Absent-Minded,”** as he is featured in several popular bedtime stories as a wish-granter and grandfatherly figure to the stories’ heroes, and this has become his most well-known title. 

Omesu's most direct and active worshippers are mostly researchers, inventors, and wizards of all stripes. These followers will generally call their god by the more reverent title of “Great Teacher,” out of respect for the visions Omesu sends to his most successful acolytes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**DOMAINS:** Arcana, Forge, Knowledge, Invention, Creation

&amp;#x200B;

**TENETS**

* *Innovation over perfection*: Omesu does not demand perfect inventions or comprehensive discoveries. He simply wants NEW innovations, whatever their form.

&amp;#x200B;

* *Discovery is its own reward:* Great works and discoveries are rewarded with the opportunity for more discovery and greater understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

* *Creativity must be kindled, and never allowed to be stifled:* Mentoring and teaching are rewarded, sabotage and the stifling of ideas are punished.

&amp;#x200B;

**DOGMA**

Omesu is a well-known deity, but for most mortals, he exists in the background. His portrayal as the “Absent-Minded” character in the stories has led to most people seeing him as benevolent, but aloof, and there is much truth to this. 

But those who worship him actively have a greater understanding of the Great Teacher. Omesu is the world-builder, the celestial tinkerer, and our world is but one of countless others that Omesu has cast, half-finished, into the heavens. While he is brilliant and curious, Omesu is also easily distracted; he will often create a new world to test out an idea, only to abandon that world when a new idea comes along. 

These unfinished creations are realms of madness and beauty, and can range from barely navigable dreamscapes to worlds with fully formed nations and cultures. There are creatures only half-created that still cling to some form of life. There are worlds that never saw the warmth of a sun, and have been frozen in perpetual night. Continents wracked by seas of molten bronze, titanic golems wandering plains of glass, hollow voids of absolute nothingness, all can be found among the forgotten creations of the Great Teacher.

The most ambitious followers of Omesu know that not only do these realms exist, they can be found if one knows where to look. Those who impress Omesu with a grand invention or discovery may be gifted with a vision from the Great Teacher that reveals some truth about the greater universe. These followers, known as the **Enlightened**, are given brief, fleeting glimpses into the nature of reality.

These visions are beyond the ability of a mortal mind to fathom, and so each Enlightened blessed with such a vision interprets them in different ways as their minds struggle to process the flash of understanding. One student may have a vision of leaves of brass burning as they fall from golden trees; another may see an overwhelming, infinite number of lines connecting everything around them, a glimpse into how Omesu views reality; still another may imagine themselves repeatedly disintegrating and reforming into new shapes. These Enlightened will usually spend much time meditating on these visions, to try and glean clear information from the often bewildering experience.

Not every vision is a grand revelation into the nature of existence; some are simply a look into Omesu’s forgotten worlds. Once studied and meditated upon, these visions can show that Enlightened how to find and potentially access these realms. Some of Omesu’s most powerful acolytes have journeyed to these realms and even claimed them as their own, and now rule as nearly absolute masters of reality in their personal worlds.

Some are despots who revel in their newfound power, and see themselves as having finally been rewarded with a prize worthy of their genius. Others are generous sages, who transform their plane into a place of creation and meditation and welcome any who come to their plane seeking knowledge. Some of these realms are constantly shifting at their master's whim, and are impossible to traverse without that person’s consent. 

The most mysterious, and most coveted of these realms are those that have been purposely hidden away by their masters, sealed off from the rest of the universe and used as celestial vaults. Many of these vaults have been lost or inaccessible for centuries, their masters long missing or dead, and their possible contents are a matter of great debate among the Enlightened. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**CLERGY, TEMPLES, AND SYMBOLS**

Omesu's most recognizable symbol is that of an anvil crowned with stars, representing the worlds and wonders forged by Omesu and cast through the heavens. The exact shape and color of this symbol matters little to Omesu himself, but his followers usually color the shapes in white or a rich gold, on a background of deep blue.

The Great Teacher has few fully dedicated clergy, as most of his devoted followers are too occupied with their own studies and research to proselytize. However, Omesu smiles on those who offer advice and wisdom to others, and those Enlightened who take the time to mentor amateur inventors are more likely to receive new visions from the Great Teacher.

Members of the Enlightened that dedicate themselves to such mentorships may wear an item of clothing, often a stole or sash, to display their status as a teacher. These items are enchanted with a simple illusion that gives them appearance of a starry night sky, and give the impression that one could reach through them and touch the glimmering stars beyond. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**ALLIES OF THE FAITH**

Any who act as patrons for research and development, whether through the funding of research projects or the protection of new ideas from persecution. This could be a wealthy merchant who bankrolls an ambitious inventor, or the head of a large university who defends ideas labeled dangerous or heretical by more conservative viewers. 

This extends to any who assist in the development of new ideas or discoveries, from lowly research assistants to hardened mercenaries hired to protect a scholar during an excavation of cursed ruins. All who aid are considered friends.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**ENEMIES OF THE FAITH**

Those that seek to stifle innovation, whether out of fear or superstition, or out of jealousy of another’s work, are branded as enemies of Omesu. 

As Omesu is not a warlike deity, he does not call on his followers to confront these enemies. Instead, he encourages his students to let their work speak for itself, and to let skeptics be convinced by its value. If others threaten the safety of his students or their work, then they are allowed to fight in self-defense, but proactively striking at the enemies of progress is considered cowardly by most followers of Omesu; one’s work should be defense enough. 

Omesu values competition amongst his students, and the freedom to pursue ideas is one of his core tenets. His worship is a meritocracy, but attempts at sabotage are not tolerated, and deliberately undermining another's work is one of the few ways to quickly earn Omesu's wrath. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**HOLIDAYS AND FESTIVALS**

Most major cities will observe the **Promenade**, a festival of invention and discussion in honor of Omesu. This festival is a great (and often rowdy) assembly of inventors and researchers, who gather to display their work to the public in hopes of being noticed both by one of the Enlightened, and by Omesu himself. The Great Teacher’s fickle attention is drawn to festivals like the Promenade, and he is known to sometimes deliver visions to those attendees he finds most promising. This festival is held on the day of the winter solstice, to represent the power of invention to carry mortals through dark, cold times.

But among the Enlightened, there is another, more controversial day of note. Some of these scholars solemnly observe the **Night of the Forgotten**, an evening of remembrance for those denizens of the worlds left behind by Omesu. These Enlightened mourn for the worlds that never lived, left to wither on the vine. 

The Night of the Forgotten is celebrated only in secret by the most iconoclastic students of Omesu, and is considered by most to be, in a word largely alien to the worship of Omesu, heresy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**CHAMPIONS AND AVATARS**

Those Enlightened that become the rulers of their own realms are seen as living embodiments of Omesu’s blessings, and on the rare occasion they visit their home plane, are treated with great celebrity. With few exceptions, these powerful wizards prefer to remain in their personal worlds, experimenting and shaping reality at will. Many ambitious scholars seek an audience with these beings, hoping to glean information or advice.

However, there is one of the Enlightened who, despite having conquered her own realm centuries ago, has stayed firmly planted in the world of the common people. **Yrlissa Siannodel** is an elven wizard who has become a renowned sage in her elder years, and is sought out by scholars and leaders the world over for her deep knowledge of arcana. She can often be found giving lectures on magic and nature to rapt audiences at the universities of the great cities.

But while Yrlissa, known as “Selhe” (“Bright One”) among her fellow elves, knows much about the Great Teacher’s infinite worlds, she speaks little of her own realm. When asked, she will smoothly deflect and change the topic, and if pressed, will say that “There is nothing there for you, child, or for me.” She fiercely guards any knowledge of her world, and will desperately fight to prevent any from traveling to it. When an especially ambitious wizard attempted to open a portal to this realm, Yrlissa slew him without hesitation, and this secret haunts her even a century later. Whatever waits in that realm, it terrifies Yrlissa, and her greatest fear is that she will one day die, and be unable to safeguard the ways to it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**KNOWN SECTS/CULTS**

The only major sect of note are the **Etheriumites**, a splinter group of the Enlightened who believe that the flesh is weak, and that the inventor is called to better himself through body modifications. Etheriumites replace entire body parts, such as a hand or a leg, with enchanted metal versions, often adding new features such as writhing, precise tendrils in place of fingers. 

Such wizards are considered grotesque by most average people, and are the ones most commonly cited by detractors as evidence of the corrupting influence of technology. The greater community of Omesu’s followers generally tolerate the Etheriumites, but may resent them for giving the Great Teacher a bad name among the people.

And that's a wrap. Thanks for reading!",1,"Omesu Absent-Minded, Great Teacher, God of Creation"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,66,"The Goblinoids fit a unique role in the pantheon of different monsters. They are naturally neutral creatures who are cursed by their wicked gods into fits of rage, tyranny, and war. But it begs the question of what would happen if goblinoids disconnected from their gods? I hope to answer that question today with Fetnis.     
     
***    
    
#History    
    
Approximately 300 years ago, a female Hobgoblin was born into a influential hobgoblin war camp. Her name was Fetninis, and she was born the warlord of the clan and an unknown surrogate mother. Remarkably, Fetninis inherited the divine soul sorcerery that goblinoids rarely have. While her father raised her to be as much of a warlord as he was, she rejected his beliefs. In a fit of anger, he threw his daughter out of the camp and out on her own.   
   
While she was out in the wilderness by herself, she found some fellow deserters from her camp.  
A couple of hobgoblins who were sent off into opposing war parties. They left due to wanting to be together rather than constantly being apart raiding.   
A goblin mother and her child. She was told to give up her son as the camp already had enough goblins.   
And lastly a female bugbear who brought her brother with her. He had spoken up against the hobgoblins and been kicked out. She knew she couldn't leave him out alone.    
    
The band of 7 roamed the land hoping to find a home for themselves. Whenever one of them got sick or injured, Fetninis could heal them back to full health so they can continue their journey. Eventually they came across a peninsula formed by an ancient volcano and found it to be a good spot to set up a permanent home. Without many other people around and a fertile land, they could survive here for a long time.   
    
Fetninis had an epiphany one night while she was going to bed: the reason why her people had been so ruthless was because their gods were corrupting them. There was folklore of the olden days when the goblinoid people were all hunter gatherers who did little to bother others. But when the spirits started to persuade the leaders of the tribes into raiding, it went all downhill from there.   
    
So while the other people in her small tribe were out working the fields and producing food, she focused all her sorcerous energy into a sentence:  
""Our gods a corrupting force, we must ignore them if we wish to survive. Come to the southern peninsula if you want to be free.""  
She sent it out into the ether, not knowing where it would go. Eventually she learned that this was the *sending* spell and she focused it in on various different goblinoids.   
    
As the moons passed, many more goblinoids came to the peninsula in search of a new way of life. They were tired of living in squalid conditions and wanted to follow Fetninis' way instead. So together they worked to establish their first city: Wosian as a base of operations.    
    
The nation of Fetnis grew more power over time. Eventually the nearby human nations journeyed to investigate. After several negotiations, the nation was recognized as a non-threat and permitted to stay.   
   
By her 84th year, Fetnis lived a long and fruitful life. She had established a democracy and philosphy of the nation that she hoped to sustain. While much change has happened since her death, many still try to invoke her vision for a goblinoid future with no gods and prosperity.   
   
Unfortunately, the previous war culture brought in by the new immigrants didn't go away completely. This lead to Fetnis having a very strict, but fair society where the military continued to be a great virtue.    
   
In recent history, Fetnis has started to ramp up their technology. They are on the verge of an entire industrial revolution that could change the world for good.   
    
#Ideology   
     
Many debate what was the true meaning of Fetninis words. While nearly all people in Fetnis agree that the goblinoid gods are something to be avoided, there is argument on how they should now function.   
The literalists take all of Fetninis' teachings as fact and apply them. They want Fetnis to act exactly how a human government may work. The most common belief among them is that if they become like the other races, then they will accept Fetnis more. They currently make up a slight minority of the Fetninians.   
The traditionalists agree with the literalists in that Fetninis was right in rejecting the gods, but believe that they should still maintain a strong military presence to ward off invaders. The traditionalists think that the other races will still see them as monsters and are always ready to attack. So if they do, Fetnis should always be ready to fight back. This is a holdover from their faithful days when Maglubiyet still ruled their people.    
    
The balance between these two groups sway back and forth, but the traditionalists have been ruling for the last two decades.  
    
#Culture    
    
Due to the traditionalist's increasing militant focus, the nation's entire culture is based around the military.  
  
From each mother, at least one boy from age 6 to 60 must serve in the military. The first 5 years of their training, boys are trained in both the ways of the sword and the spell. Afterwards, they choose if they wish to stay with either martial abilities, or wizarding.  
Their training regiments are tough and brutal, wanting to create perfect soldiers. By the time they reach adulthood in their late teens, every goblinoid is trained for war.    
    
Women stay home and are not allowed to serve in the military. They do almost all the blue and white collar jobs in the cities while the men are out in their brigades.   
    
While Fetnis no longer actively conquers like their ancestors did. The military now serves it's several allies all over the world. Keeping order in far off communities and countries for the sake of improving Fetnis' image.     
    
Due to their long term removal from the opposite sex, many goblins of both genders form connections with other goblinoids of the same gender. These people are called Urubats (partners in Goblin). Sometimes these are merely platonic, sometimes romantic or sexual. But it is recommended that everyone has an Urubat to keep morale high.  
Every year in mid Autumn, all the various male goblinoids come home for what is called the ""Yachtza"" (the loving in Goblin). All pretenses of modesty, restraint and orderliness that the Fetninian culture normally has are cast aside. Any indecency laws are removed for two weeks during Yachtza as adult goblinoids of all ages are recommended to have as much sex as possible. Due to a year of not seeing another person of the opposite gender and same race, heterosexual and bisexual male goblinoids father a massive amount of children during this time. By the end of Yachtza, everyone is exhausted and takes another week brake before returning to their stations.   
    
Due to their unique way of reproduction and relationships, most Fetninians don't know who their father is while being raised by their two mothers.    
    
#Classes   
       
Something that is heavily taboo in Fetnis is any form of religion. Due to the goblinoids having negatively influencing gods rather than positively like other races, Clerics are seen as people who threaten a way of life. While it is commonly known among Fetninians that there are good gods, they still do not worship them due to a lingering taboo.   
Visitors to Fetnis are warned **strongly** to leave any of their gods at home while visiting the country.   
    
Divine soul sorcerers usually fill the roles that clerics normally do in a community. They can heal the sick and bring guidance to the lost. Males with a divine spark are allowed to abstain from military service.  
The divine spark is often called Fetninis' compassion for that reason.   
Sorcerers of other origins are rarely given much recognition. Usually they are drafted into the military regardless of gender and put with the wizards.   
    
Warlocks are often made in smaller communities that may not have a divine soul in the area. Usually making pacts with celestials who Fetninis befriended with before her death, they give the healing and guidance in more rural areas of Fetnis.    
     
Wizards are common among the military, but are rare elsewhere. The capitol of Wosian is a very good place for foreign wizards to get trained at however as they have cataloged nearly every single spell in their college libraries.    
     
Druids are rare among Fetnis. While worship is a taboo, druidism rides on the line of it. Druids are rare simply because technology is valued among Fetnis while nature is disregarded. Druids sometimes act as harvest witches, helping rural Fetninians grow their crops better.    
    
Bards are also a rare sight among Fetnis. Although many bards do visit during Yachtza to experience the promiscuous annual ritual they have. Most of the Fetnis native bards will be found among the generals of the military who have gone the path of swords or valor.    
     
Rogues, fighters, and paladins are all commonly found among the military's sword ranks. They are usually sent out on missions together and make up the bulk of the military as a whole.    
     
Barbarians are **very** rare among Fetnis, even more so than clerics. Due to a culture of restraint and orderliness, anger is something that is looked down on in favor of serenity.   
    
Monks are occasionally found among the military. They are a very specialized branch that few members get into due to it's high physical requirements.    
    
Rangers are similar to monks in that most will be found in specialized sectors of the military. They are high ranking, scouting areas ahead for smaller parties.   
    
#Relations with other races    
     
**Humans:**  
Many humans see Fetninians with a bit of suspicion, just like they may do with any other monsterous race. The countries that are closer to Fetnis may accept them more, but more foreign countries don't trust them.    
     
**Elves:**    
Valuing freedom, elves often look down upon Fetnis. Due to them having a similar lifespan to humans, they never have enough time to truly get good at anything. Elves may ally with Fetnis just out of conveniance rather than an ideological similarity. Having one of the world's strongest militaries protect your people is helpful.    
    
**Dwarves:**    
Dwarves have a good relationship with Fetnis usually. They both value highly lawful societies, but the goblinoids usually disregard family structure unlike the dwarves. The ores that dwarves mine up are usually bought by Fetnis to make more factories, railways, and machines.    
     
**Dragonborn:**   
The Dragonborn respect Fetnis for their focus on making their people very efficient and effective. But they aren't a fan of their methods, thinking that it should be self motivated rather than externally motivated.    
    
**Halflings:**    
Halflings rarely settle in Fetnis for fear of their military. They wish to live a simple life rather than work for a military or efficient structure.    
    
**Gnomes:**    
Gnomes are often brought into Fetnis for their ingenuity. The various different technologies in Fetnis are made by a collaborative effort of rock gnomes and hobgoblins.    
    
**Tieflings, Genasi, and Aasimar:**    
The planetouched are seen as normal people in Fetnis. Generally people do not judge on race, as the entire country was founded on that very principle. So any otherworldly people can find a home in the nation of goblins

I am going to suspend all normal monthly activities (except for the AMAs) to bring you a special month of events!

This has been asked for a lot over the past year or so, and I figured the holiday season would be a great time to do this - a little present from BTS to you!

We are going to create a city, crowdsourced. Its gonna be a crazy mess, but it will be full of your ideas and be something everyone can pick up and run!

So here's how its going to work. 

This is going to a major population center. A hub, if you will. It will have many districts, many cultures, and many mysteries and strange things. Each week, we will crowdsource new bits of the city, layering as we go, and by the end, we'll have something weird and amazing!

Netflix announced [yet another thing](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/netflixs-anime-announcement-frenzy-capped-off-by-live-action-cowboy-bebop/) no one asked for. But in celebration of an Anime classic, and to add onto [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9zj850/what_pokemon_taught_me_about_worldbuilding/) series, here's some lessons you can learn from Cowboy Bebop.

1. Bounty of the Week
--
* The key to controlling a session is to know your enemy
* In Bebop, every episode (session) revolves around a bounty that the gang is chasing. 
* **Find your bounty.** It can be a reoccuring villain, or a Monster of the Week scenario. 
* This is tied into your Theme. In the war example from the Pokemon post, the enemy is the opposing force.

2. Structure
--
* To goal of knowing your enemy is to have a structure. 
* Bebop's structure is simple: 1. there's a new bounty, 2. the gang goes after the bounty, 3. the gang doesn't get rich.
* This is most feasible to plot in an episodic game, where every session can have an individual story
* But **Bebop's structure comes from the Villains**. It comes from the Theme that there will always be another bounty to catch, they will always mess up, and they will always escalate. 

3. Villains
--
* So to create your Structure, even in a serial campaign, you must only know the steps your enemy will take to succeed their goal
* Continuing the war example: the enemy will always try to win the war. Doing this can be done in many ways, to create some variance, but we can make a list of three steps that all of the opposing forces see the world through: 1. There's a new target, we send troops to deal with the target, we win the war. 
* Ever need to know what the enemy force is trying to do? Wherever the PCs are is a new target. The opposing forces will send troops to handle this new target, either by destroying it, capturing it, planting a spy, etc. In the hopes that they'll win the war.

4. Pacing
--
* Bebop tells a fulfilling and impactful episode in 22 minutes. You have 3 hours (or more) to be a part of something that is fun. Doesn't even need to be impactful. Just fun for the table.
* If you watch Bebop, you'll see that, like in D&amp;D, the gang meanders, wanders, gets distracted A LOT. They focus on the wrong things, follow the wrong leads, wind up at ""dead ends"" of the Bounty Hunt. 
* The Villains always stay on track though. And this creates pace.
* If your session feels like its lagging, if it feels like your party is losing their place, if there is a big lull and nothing is happening and you feel the game slipping away...your villain is trying to accomplish their goal.
* YOU can act in the face of party inaction. You, in the guise of the world, can act.

4b. Types of Action
--
* The villain does something devastating nearby
* The villain attacks the party
* The villain takes hostages
* The villain escalates the situation
* The villain is spotted making an escape
* The villain slips up and reveals their position

5. Communication
--
* Cowboy Bebop communicates with its cast. The world, I mean, communicates with the gang to push the show along. Most episodes are started with a TV program giving the gang their new bounty. And when this doesn't happen, either they stumble onto a bounty wherever they happen to be, or the character's backstories come back to haunt them.
* As a DM, I find a lot of joy in worldbuilding that communicates with the players
* Bounty boards are the big example of this in a standard fantasy world. Open a session with the bounty board and you're off to the races
* But you have freedom to communicate in other ways. Quest giving NPCs that have a personality and depth can be a great way to open a session, which creates a pacing but also allows for RP.

5b. Backstories
--
* Spike has a personal villain that haunts him. And because of this past life, he has a lot of contacts. I'd say 1/4th of episodes have something to do with Spike's past, or someone from the Gang's past. 
* Matthew Mercer, DM for Critical Role, almost exclusively communicates to the party through their backstories. Their gods, patrons, past friends, enemies, etc. 
* When your PCs hand you a backstory, it is a gift of resources that all allow you to communicate directy to your party through the game

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I had a lot of questions last article about session pacing. ""What if the party gets hung up on something you didn't expect?"" and things like that. I was watching Bebop at the time and started to notice that the same things happened in the show, but there was still this through-line of action and movement. 

The two big take aways are
1. Villains - know them and their plans and your party will never be lulled into boredom
2. Communication through the world - create many ways to communicate to your party, thus stopping any ""dead ends"" during a campaign. 

Let me know if you think Villains and/or Communication could be expanded into a separate article with concrete tools/ideas for you to implement.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,19,119,"Long time no see, BTS! I was going through and clearing out my old Roll20 account and discovered a small treasure trove of homebrew content I'd made over the past couple years, when I was a fresh DM! Among those was my first homebrewed monster, the Stirge Swarm. I cleaned up the formatting a bit, and I'd like to introduce you.

---

###Stirge Swarm  
*Made for 4 level 3 characters*

HP: 100 (to taste)

AC: 14

Str: 8, Dex: 18, Con: 12, Int: 2, Wis: 8, Cha: 6

Speed: 10 ft., fly 40 ft.

Size: Large

Immunities: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned

Resistances: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing

Senses: blindsight 30ft

---

**Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a stirge. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, except when stirges rejoin the swarm.

**Bloodscent.** The swarm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. The swarm will prioritize a target with bleeding wounds.

**Fear of Fire.** The stirge swarm is averse to fire, and has disadvantage on any attacks made while within 5 ft. of a source of fire.

###Attacks

**Blood Drain.** +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., any creatures next to or inside the swarm. *Hit:* 4d4+4 piercing damage, and 1d4 **stirges** attach themselves to each creature hit. For each stirge attached in this way, the swarm loses 1 hit point.

At the start of the swarm's turn, every creature loses 1d4+4 hit points for each stirge attached to it. For every 10 hit points a single creature loses in this way, a stirge will detach itself from that creature and rejoin the swarm, restoring 1 hit point to the swarm when it does so. A creature (including the target) can use an action to kill and remove 1d4-1 stirges from a creature (minimum 1).

**(I gave the stirges in this encounter 1 hit point and basically had them die if interacted with--the minion treatment. This creature becomes *exponentially more complicated and dangerous* if you treat them as normal.)**

---

This sucker was the end-boss of my then-party's first adventure, and if not dealt with properly can wreck a party that ignores its mechanics. I roleplayed the fear of fire pretty blatantly and the adventure revolved around a local apothecary using stirges to collect blood for use in making an illicit drug, so the party had some experience dealing with stirges by the time they went up against the swarm itself. I also found that players took great pleasure in tracking the damage done by stirges once they figured out that they'd leave after a certain threshold, which gave them a nice bit of agency in tracking combat.

(To get a little game designer-y, I think it also does a good job of illustrating the danger of small threats adding up, which conditioned my players to be much more mindful of environmental hazards and minions in later encounters, which meant I could get much more brutal and creative, which was great for everyone!)

Alright folks, that's 3 of 4 for this month's post goals; a little behind, but such is life. I'll have another one up by Friday, but in the meantime: what questions or thoughts do you have on it? Got a unique swarm encounter you want to share? I wanna hear about it! Any fun stirge stories? Lay em on us!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,106,"I am a long-time fan of the Destiny games--which are set in a futuristic post-apocalypse setting that spans multiple planets of our solar system, but evoke a lot of their lore and world from fantasy settings. One thing in particular that I found to be a particularly interesting idea that the game uses is a place called ""The Prison of Elders."" Essentially, there is a faction in that world that imprisons dangerous, evil space monsters from around the solar system, as opposed to simply killing them as the players usually do. They then send many of them into gladiatorial combat with each other, or against the players. A few weeks ago, I was playing Destiny with some of the players from one of my D&amp;D games, and through the course of the conversation, it dawned on me that this could be a great setting for a D&amp;D campaign for players who prefer high-combat scenarios.

There are a number of activities that the players can undergo for one of these ""Monster Prison"" settings:

* The master of the prison hires the players to track down and capture a monster (or a number of monsters) from an exotic locale, such as an elemental plane, the Underdark, or the Feywild

* The players participate in gladiatorial combat against some of the prison's inhabitants

* An evil NPC hires the players to free a monster or group of monsters from the prison and return them to him

* Several monsters escape the prison, and the players are hired to bring them back, dead or alive

* A riot ensues, and the prison is thrown into chaos--monstrous prisoners begin slaughtering guards and each other in fits of rage or desperation to escape. The warden calls in the players to bring order to the prison by any means necessary.

And probably more, but that's everything that I have thought of myself/stole from the video game. Most of these would be combat-focused scenarios, but there are certainly RP opportunities scattered throughout that a DM more clever than I could make use of. 

Anyway, that's my idea that I wanted to share. None of my current campaigns are in a spot where I could really implement something like this, so I figured I would throw the idea out there in the hopes that someone else might like it. Apologies if something like this has been posted before, I'm relatively new to this subreddit and to D&amp;D.",1,Adventure Hook/Campaign Idea: The Prison of Elders (Monster Prison)

	95. Simic - Gruul: Smaller labs are being raided by a scrawny Gruul human. He seeks to make himself strong enough to challenge Borborygmos, and has been growing more dangerous with each raid. 
	96. Simic - Izzet: Many generations ago a joint experiment went horribly wrong. Results of that experiment are starting to resurface as a recent breakthrough shed new light on the situation, causing the ancestors of these experiments to both step up asking for the credit and reward.
	97. Simic - Orzhov: Biomancers on the brink of discovery describe being stalked by gargoyles until they disappear suddenly.

",1,100 Plot Hooks for Ravnica
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,21,218,"In an effort to give my players a real reason to want to care about their reputations and their local city, one of the first things I did for them was gift them a home after completing their first adventure.  It wasn't anything special, but never the less it served as a home base.  The local temple became the place that they could effectively go for quests if they wanted some railroady content, but otherwise could just choose plot hooks as they were given out.  

As their good deeds grew, however, I decided it might be fun for players to be able to enhance their home with some upgrades.   As such, I've created a list of items, services, and upgrades that my players can purchase as they earn coin.  The values in my document make relative sense for my world, but could be easily modified to fit whatever currency or objectives you wanted.  

Also, I love puns.  So there's puns.

In any event, I hope some (any) of you would find the following useful or fun for your campaigns.  Would love any additional feedback or ideas to add to it.

",1,An extensive up-gradable home for your adventurers.
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,97,"Summoning spells. Minionmancers. Every DM loves them, am I right? There's always that special time when your druid or ranger comes of age and finally unleashes eight pixies on your boss… But it's not the power spike or the bogging down of combat that bothers me (and besides, there are ways to mitigate those). It is when players look at these summoned creatures as mere statblocks, as just another spell that deals damage, knocks prone or grapples; or when the creatures are used as cannon fodder or disposable trap triggers.

Even though these fey spirits are summoned with a purpose, obey commands and are not destroyed but merely banished upon death, they are still sentient creatures. Most fey speak languages that the players are likely to share, and if you are a Circle of the Shepherd druid, you can also communicate with *all beasts at will*, which opens up a whole lot of opportunities for creature characterization. 

Most of us have lists of merchants and innkeepers with quirky personalities, so why not have one with interesting summoned creatures? They might have to follow their summoner's orders, but that doesn't mean they can't also speak to each other, comment on what's going on, complain, give suggestions, tell stories of their otherworldly existence, hint of a larger universe and generally have unique personalities that color their actions. A character is not just summoning a swarm of faceless, *polymorph*-spamming pixie-bots. They are calling upon the aid of their favorite band of little rascals. Who says druids can't have animal companions like they did in 3.5e? At the expense of a single 3rd-level spell slot, you too can call upon your loyal friends. The summoned creatures can thus become recurring characters and form a bond with their summoner that goes beyond the slavery-like relationship implied in the spells' descriptions. 

So, here are a few examples for 5e's Conjure Woodland Beings (2 dryads, 4 satyrs and 8 pixies) and for Conjure Animals (8 wolves). Naturally, these descriptions are just to roleplaying purposes. The creatures' statblocks remain unchanged.    

***

#The Dryad Sisters

These three dryads were once very close both geographically and as friends. Then a cataclysm in the Feywild rearranged the topography of their forest and separated their trees. Like alienated childhood friends, they haven't seen each other in a long time. And while they remember their past fondly, time has set them on very different paths. When they are first summoned (two at a time), the dryads are eager to catch up, but soon discover they don't like each other very much. 

**Clover** - a willowy dryad wearing an attire made of vibrant four-leaved clovers. She is kind and innocent, always baffled to see violence in the world. She's a firm believer that all conflict can be resolved via peaceful means. Most of the time Clover appears distant and dreamy, always studying her surroundings and making eccentric comments that sometimes contain oracular insights. She likes to attribute human qualities to inanimate objects. For example: Rivers can be naughty.  Fire is usually angry, though she can talk it down (using *druidcraft*). The metal in swords wants to go back to the rocks whence it came. It didn't enjoy being forged. The grass says hello. The stones are being grumpy today. That oak has sworn vengeance against the party's fire-hurling wizard. Etc. 

**Narcissa** - arrogant and selfish, she believes that all should adore her. Garbed in a splendid attire of white and yellow blossoms, she always expects compliments. Using *Fey Charm* has become a second nature to her and she eagerly asks her summoner to allow her to bend the minds of other mortals, so that the two of them can be worshipped the way they deserve. 

**Bitterberry** - a proud defender of the natural world. She sees civilization as dangerous and will advise others to return to the ways of nature lest they bring about their own destruction. Things should be grown, not fabricated. Bitterberry looks competent and dangerous wielding her gnarled shillelagh. Even prior to casting barkskin, her body is covered with thick scales of black cherry bark. 

***

#The Faun Fraternity

These four satyrs form a brotherhood of sorts. Sworn to drink deeply of life, they have quite the reputation in the Feywild. To this day, fey still talk of the party they threw for the Twilight Princess's sweet-sixteen-hundredth birthday. Anyone who is planning a celebration of any kind would benefit greatly from calling these satyrs forth to help. In fact, regardless of what situation they are called into, they will do their best to transform it into a party. When first summoned, the satyrs complain loudly about being whisked away from *the Festival of the Twin Moons, the Deepwood Feast, the Great Fertility Ceremony* or some other bacchanalia. 

**Foc** - an excellent performer with the panpipes, as well as an accomplished singer. He knows countless add-a-verse songs with an ever increasing number of sexual innuendos (*The Plump and Rosy Grape, The Beast with Two Backs* (goes up to ten), *The Dagger's Sheath*). Foc will perform unless explicitly told not to. If he witnesses some act of particularly epic proportions, he will use the time between summons to compose and suitably epic ballad about it.   
 
**Firminus** - this slick-haired satyr-playboy knows all about seduction, but can at times be a little too cold and conniving in his techniques. Tends to objectify both women and men. Tries to discover the romantic interests of his summoner and then encourages them to pursue those interests, offering his advice and quoting his breadth of experience.    

**Jig** - an excellent dancer. Will ask people to dance with him and will be upset if they stop. He is only satisfied when both he and his partner have gained three levels of exhaustion. Then the drinking can commence. Jig dances instead of walking and is fond of producing loud, rhythmic clicks with his hooves (not great for stealth). He also incorporates performance moves in his attacks: *the heel turn kick, the free spin dodge, the moonwalk disengage, the split leap strike* are among his favorite.    

**Merris** - boasts a fluffy moustache and a round belly. A kind soul, but always drunk. Will overshare stories of a dryad who broke his heart (the cruel Narcissa told him he wasn't good enough for her). Asks his summoner of their own regrets in life and offers to have a good, honest conversation over some wine. Merris's failed attacks are always a result of his inebriated state. Occasionally, he apologizes for showing up drunk on the job. 

***

#A Flutter of Pixies

Though these eight pixies know each other from the Feywild, they are anything but a cohesive team. A violent eruption of fairy dust and the flutter of little wings announce their arrival. Their summoner had better issue commands quickly, because when left to their own devices, these little neurotic fellows are a recipe for disaster. 

*The Girls…*   

**Snowbelle** - a little wannabe ice queen, dressed in blue and white. She can be haughty and cold at times. Takes particular pleasure in snuffing out fires using *druidcraft*. The cold, on the other hand, never bothers her.   
 
**Glitterbomb** - an absolutely fabulous pixie with the attitude of a pop singer. Dressed in bright neon colors (luminescent fungi), she is charismatic, loud and knows how to work a crowd. All her spells are performed by sprinkling copious amounts of glitterdust all over the target. She knows exactly how to position the *dancing lights* spell to make herself look good.    

**Tinderbell** - a pretty redhead pixie from the Summer Court. She loves to eavesdrop on people's thoughts and will volunteer to use *detect thoughts* on pretty much anyone. She is also an excellent matchmaker and will attempt to find a good partner for her summoner, whether she's asked or not.    

**Roseblush** - a pathologically shy pixie. She wears a dress made of pink rose petals and doesn’t talk much. Tinderbell will attempt to get her to hook up with Cinnamon.    

*… and the Boys:*   

**Pinecone** - a rather rotund pixie who wears a large pinecone resembling heavy armor. Pinecone has been summoned before, knows to expect danger and so he's come prepared. He tells the other pixies and his summoner about the horrible deaths he has experienced under the command of others.    

**Cinnamon** - prim and polite, his short hair neatly parted in the middle, his tiny clothes looking particularly neat. Cinamon is an exemplary boy, too good for this world. He is a gentleman and will always advocate for doing the right thing (in unclear cases, he can always cast *detect good and evil*). Secretly in love with Snowbelle.    

**Murk** - a little tiny shadow fey who likes to glare at people. Sometimes he wishes he were invisible, and thankfully, as a pixie, he can be. When the situation calls for it, he likes to get creative with *phantasmal force*. He suggests to his summoner a variety of horrible scenarios that he could inflict upon the enemy.    

**Shrubbert** - curt and laconic, he is the straight man of the group. He is easily annoyed by the other pixies' erratic behavior. Particularly goal-oriented, he just wants to know what the objective is, no nonsense. Dreadfully boring when he speaks, he takes the lead when the group must put someone to *sleep*.    

***

#The Grayhollow Pack 

The Grayhollow Pack spend their time running with the Wild Hunt in the Feywild. They are a motley crew of different wolf subspecies, which of course makes no sense biologically. Instead, they embody various concepts, ideas and temperaments, and in the realm of the Fey, that defines a creature's appearance more than any natural processes. When they are first summoned, the pack immediately set to surveying their new environment and prepare for trouble and potentially a hunt.

**Chief** - the leader of the pack, a large black alpha male. Wise and sensible, he will keep the others in check and make sure they follow the summoner.    

**Nosewise** - a very old wolf. His long gray fur gives him an almost sage-like appearance. Despite being well past his prime, Nosewise is still the best at tracking and orientation. Chief values his input.   

**Bleeder** - a ferocious red wolf who is always bloodthirsty, almost rabid-seeming in his demeanor. Especially skilled at sneaking, stalking and finishing prey quickly. At first he acts aggressively even towards his summoner, but Chief soon reigns him in.    

**Bloodwind** - another red wolf, Bleeder's brother. Moves with deadly speed and predatory grace. Enjoys the hunt and the thrill of the chase, especially against fast-running enemies.    

**Moonwatcher** - a imposingly large but dumb-looking shaggy gray. Wears the perpetual expression of a lost puppy. Enjoys looking at the night sky and sometimes gains weird astrological insights from it.    

**Echo** - an arctic she-wolf. Cool and confident. If it weren't for Chief, she'd probably be the alpha.    

**Plotter** - a lean gray whose every movement looks premeditated. Aspires to be the leader of the pack. Excels at cunning schemes and evil plans, most of them concerning Chief's downfall.    

**Nibbles** - a small limping gray, the runt of the litter. Has no special skills whatsoever. Bleeder and Bloodwind frequently pick on him.

This is all I've got so far. I'll leave the sea hag characterization to you guys. I hope at least some of this can be useful to someone. I've been a long-time lurker on this sub, and I thought it was finally time to contribute something. And thanks everyone for the awesome content and advice!

",1,Summons with Personality: Adding a social aspect to Conjure Woodland Beings and Conjure Animals
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,11,49,"Took the long weekend to try my hand at my first homebrew. I have a Halfling Druid that loves to brew potions. After spending months bothering the DM and hearing groans from fellow players each time I go searching for ingredients, I decided I would try to create a system for gathering and crafting potions ingredients that would be semi-autonomous. As explained in the guide, I found tons of resources that would have pieces of the information I wanted but nothing that could be used start to end for gathering and crafting as well as recipes. So I created my own.  Thanks to all the guides I consulted with, which I have listed in the final page.

Feel free to copy it for yourself and then alter as you see fit. If you work out something better, I would love to hear! Please feel free comment or private message me with any constructive critiques, suggested edits, or angry tirades.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,24,168,"For months, I've been attempting to collate information for a spiritual successor to [this spectacular thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8isom9/nearmiddle_eastern_themed_setting_character_and/) by /u/paddywagon_man. I vowed to assemble a thread devoted to Ancient and Medieval India; those historical periods massively influenced my game. After my original game dissolved, I restructured and refined my world, thereby crystallizing a more authentic atmosphere. Here, I offer intrepid DMs opportunities to incorporate Indian history, mythologies, and cultures in their respective worlds.

Originally, I intended to organize a singular thread for Ancient and Medieval periods. However, myriad sources of inspiration demand three threads—this thread will focus entirely on mythological Hindu India; the second thread will feature Ancient India (and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism); the third thread will highlight Medieval India (and the introduction of Islam). Each setting is appended with potential adventure ideas, but DMs are encouraged to customize and modify the setting. Hindu mythology is notorious for contradictory information; the popular iteration of the Ramayana (Valmiki's Ramayana) may not actually be the original.  

# Mythological Settings

**Ayodhya (Ramayana)**: Established by Manu, the primogenitor of humankind, this city is as elaborate and ornate as it is expansive. However, it now witnesses the inception of its demise — Rama, the heir apparent, is exiled to a foreboding and treacherous forest inhabited by malefic demons. Moreover, he is accompanied by his valiant half-brother (Lakshmana) and resplendent consort (Sita). Devastated, King Dasharatha dies in his sleep. Rama's elected successor, his half-brother Bharata, refuses to ascend the throne; he only acknowledges Rama as Ayodhya's crown prince. Without a king, the city of Ayodhya is vulnerable to annexation or destruction — the citizens fervently pray to the gods for deliverance.

*Adventure Ideas*: If a player wishes to play dispossessed noble, you can offer him or her Ayodhya. Alternatively, your players might attempt to usurp Rama or offer their aid. You can choose to play the Ramayana, with a party of three representing Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita. If your party is larger, additional players can fulfil the roles of Rama’s other half-brothers or Sita’s sisters. The source material is merely inspiration. Ayodhya offers a time limit: if the party can’t secure its future in six months (entirely arbitrary), it risks subjugation by nearby kingdoms.  

**Chamundi Hills (Devi Mahatmyam)**: Eons ago, when gods freely visited mortals and the universe still revelled in *Sata Yuga*, a tyrannical buffalo demon named Mahishasura sought to depose Indra, Lord of Heaven, and conquer the three realms, thereby introducing untold suffering to mortals and gods alike. Adi Shakti, the unfathomable, incomparable, and primordial goddess of the universe, manifested as Chamundeshwari, a fearsome and bloodthirsty goddess whose powers dwarfed any god. Boasting myriad armaments of myriad gods, Chamundeshwari impaled Mahishasura with her Trishula (trident) and decapitated him. Today, the hills are named in honour of the eponymous goddess; yet, Mahishasura’s presence still scars the land, corrupting and insidious. Will Adi Shakti manifest again, or will mortal heroes answer the call of evil?

*Adventure Ideas*: The Chamundi Hills serve both as a focal point and epic battlefield. In a campaign, the evil suffusing the hills might require lionhearted adventurers. In an epic one-shot or shorter campaign, the hills might witness the battle between Chamundeshwari and Mahishasura. Effectively capturing the majesty of their battle requires some familiarity with the source material: the battle lasted nine nights and ten days, with Chamundeshwari manifesting a different incarnation when Mahishasura transformed into a different animal. If you can brave a nine-person party, each character can act as a different incarnation. Alternatively, the PCs in an extensive campaign could inherit the calamitous battle; when Mahishasura rises, Adi Shakti infuses the characters with her power.

**Dandakaranya (Ramayana)**: When Rama and Lakshmana and Sita are exiled from the opulent kingdom of Ayodhya, they roam the Dandakaranya for 14 years. The Dandakaranya is a menacing, nearly inhospitable forest teeming with Rakshasas who covet mortal flesh. Moreover, only powerful ascetics who have realized the universe survive the demons; these sages are quick to anger and deliver ruinous curses. It is here where the demoness Surpanakha futilely seduces Rama, prompting Lakshmana to cut off her nose. Additionally, the Dandakaranya is where Ravana abducts Sita.

*Adventure Ideas*: The Dandakaranya is an expansive forest dungeon. Numerous Rakshasa clans inhabit the sprawling area, and infighting is common. You can polymerize dungeons and survival: your players need to protect their camp, fend off gluttonous demons, and delicately manoeuvre social encounters with arrogant sages wielding incomparable mystical powers. If your players are passing through the Dandakaranya, you can feature it as a haunted forest. No one voluntarily inhabits the Dandakaranya; it is a fatal punishment.

**Dvārakā, or Dwaraka (Bhagavata Purana)**: Epitomizing extravagance, this mythical city was conceptualized by Krishna and constructed by Vishwakarma, the godly architect. Krishna retired to the eastern coast and boundary of the Anarta Kingdom after killing his iniquitous uncle Kansa, King of Mathura. The resplendent city of Dwaraka is a demonstrable harmony of civilization and nature: butterflies and birds choreograph enchanting dances in tiered gardens, and the enviable grace of swans accent the alluring, polychromatic beauty of myriad species of lotuses. Occupying 299 square meters of land, it is marked by 900,000 palaces ornamented with coruscating gems and jewels. Hundreds of years ago, Krishna departed this world; Dwaraka perennially mourns its founder, unceasingly celebrating his majesty.

*Adventure Ideas*: Unlike other cities, Dwaraka rarely witnesses turmoil or strife; rather, it serves as a sanctuary and reprieve for the exiled. Krishna’s grace safeguards the city, which makes Dwaraka an attractive base for a party. Your characters are guaranteed to appreciate residing in a city founded by a god—alternatively, if your Krishna is mortal, you can present Dwaraka as fortified by magic. However, its fate is decidedly unpleasant: Dwaraka was submerged and eternally lost. Perhaps your characters indefatigably search for the lost city (akin to Atlantis), or maybe one (or more) character is tied to the city. You can also subvert the opulence: perhaps the majesty of Dwaraka hides the suffering of its citizens, who are constantly flooded with positive energy, thereby denied the expression of sorrow.

**Kailash (Hinduism)**: Atop the majestic, snowy peaks of Kailash sit Shiva, the god of destruction and yoga, and his consort Parvati, goddess of nature and power. Shiva is an unyielding ascetic; Parvati grounds her husband, reminding him of his godly responsibilities and tethering him to the mortal world. Parvati is the supreme embodiment of nature; Shiva is her guide, balancing her benevolent and malevolent aspects lest she consumes the universe (and him). Together, they are Shiva and Shakti—the primaeval forces of the universe whose sexual couplings create and unmake reality. Sagacious sages and incentivized mortals journey to Kailash yearly to seek Shiva and Parvati’s blessings. 

*Adventure Ideas*: Presumably, your characters won’t reach the seat of two deities at low levels. However, you can feature Kailash as the epitome of pilgrimages; only those who are truly devout may receive the grace of Shiva and Parvati. Alternatively, you can use Kailash as a destination: Hindu mythology includes the disappearance of Parvati from Kailash when Shiva insults her; when Parvati disappears, so does nourishment and balance. Other myths include Tarakasura, a demon who can only be killed by a son of Shiva; unfortunately, Shiva has wholly embraced asceticism after the untimely demise of his first wife, Sati. The characters must facilitate his encounter with Parvati, who is presently a mortal unaware of her divine destiny. You can also highlight Shiva incinerating Kama, the god of love, when Kama tries interceding by striking Shiva with an arrow of love. Suddenly, the players must contend with the death of love (and the wrath of Bandasura, the demon who arises from Kama’s ashes and who can only be killed by Parvati).

**Kurukshetra War (Mahabharata)**: Hastinapur, capital of the supernal Kuru Kingdom, nears its dissolution again—previously, it witnessed a crisis of succession that was resolved by Pandu. Now, the Kauravas (the oldest lineage of the Kuru Kingdom) and the Pandavas (descendants of Pandu) fight for their birthright. Each lineage is appeased by inheriting half of the Kuru Kingdom. However, Duryadhona, eldest of the Kauravas, becomes excessively jealous when the Pandavas transform their half into the incomparable Indraprastha. Their feud is suspended for 14 years when Duryadhona exiles the Pandavas, who foolishly gambled away their property. However, the Pandavas’ exile is supplemented with a stipulation: they must remain incognito. When the Pandavas return, quarrelling explosively escalates to war; Duryadhona invalidates their exile, claiming they failed to conceal their identities. Thus, the Kurukshetra War begins, and cousins slaughter cousins. The supernal and shrewd Krishna advises the Pandavas, encouraging the brothers to consistently fight for objective, impartial justice—even if that means compromising their individual morals.

*Adventure Ideas*: If you want to emphasize political intrigue, subterfuge, and tension, the Kurukshetra War is a political smorgasbord. Hastinapur has an elaborate, storied history of birthrights and succession. Interested DMs are highly encouraged to incorporate the tradition of *niyoga*, wherein a woman is impregnated by an austere, revered man when her husband is impotent or deceased. *Niyoga* produced the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas: Dhritarashtra and Pandu, respectively. Pandu only inherits Hastinapur because Dhritarashtra is born blind; in turn, Dhritarashtra develops resentment for Pandu. Is your party descended from Dhritarashtra or Pandu? Do they side with the Kauravas or the Pandavas? Maybe your campaign vilifies the Pandavas while extolling the Kauravas. The Kuru Kingdom includes numerous vassals, providing DMs multiple avenues to customize and rewrite the story. Perhaps your characters each originate from an individual vassal, or they are sourced from one vassal which conspires to overthrow Pandu (or later Dhritarashtra). The character of Krishna offers opportunities for moral ambiguity and relativism: Krishna in the Mahabharata is the paragon of righteousness, but in your campaign, he might advance his own goals. If you desire politics and war games, the Kurukshetra War will never disappoint.

**Lanka (Ramayana)**: Spectacularly erudite but oppressively overzealous, the Rakshasa king Ravana has abducted Sita, wife of Rama. He holds Sita hostage on his island kingdom, promising to lavishly love her if she renounces her husband. Rama initiates a gruelling, expansive expedition to retrieve Sita; he is accompanied by his half-brother Lakshmana, his dear friend and greatest devotee Hanuman, and an impressively qualified army of Vanaras (monkey-men). Ironically, Rama’s efforts are impeded by his perspicacious wife: Sita refuses to abscond Lanka with Rama’s companions, demanding her husband crystallize his husbandly duties by rescuing his wife himself. 

*Adventure Ideas*: The Ramayana is rich with usable content: divine heritage, a damsel in distress, a Rakshasa (an actual Rakshasa!), monkey-men, and a massive island kingdom with advanced technology (Ravana operates a Vimana, a flying palace and chariot). However, there are opportunities to emphasize the patriarchal *and* subversive subtext: Sita is treated as a defenceless maiden, yet she is the mortal incarnation of Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity; Rama forces Sita to prove her chastity by undergoing a trial by fire; Sita repeatedly challenges Rama, demanding he prove his worth just as she must prove hers. The setting brilliantly serves an epic campaign—the characters might be Rama and his companions or a group of Vanaras (monkey hijinks ensue) or a different party destined to rewrite history. Alternatively, you can run an evil campaign wherein the party fights Rama.

**Lanka (Adbhuta Ramayana)**: Ravana is dead; the valiant Rama killed the Rakshasa king and retrieved Sita. However, there exists a second Lanka and a second Ravana: the elder brother of the deceased Ravana is exceedingly powerful and functionally invincible. When Rama reaches this second Lanka, the elder Ravana demonstrates his power by nearly killing the crown prince of Ayodhya. Sita then demonstrates her power by transmuting into Bhadrakali, the goddess of time and slayer of evildoers. She summarily decapitates the elder Ravana (removing his 1000 heads in one fell strike) and summons his female prisoners, who drink his blood and massacre his soldiers.

*Adventure Ideas*: The Adbhuta Ramayana is perhaps most effective as a short campaign or high-level one-shot. Ideally, the characters are all female; the Adhbuta Ramayana is Sita’s story, detailing her journey to reaching divinity more powerful than Rama. You can also craft the characters as a party of female warriors who inspire Sita to fight for herself. 

**Samudra Manthan**: When haughty Indra disrespects the mercurial sage Durvasa, Indra is cursed: he is dispossessed of his powers and majesty. Unable to lead the gods, Indra is routinely defeated by the asuras, who assume control of his kingdom. However, Vishnu reassures Indra he will soon recover his majesty. The gods diplomatically approach the asuras; they offer the asuras joint possession of Amrita, the nectar of immortality. Amrita must be churned from the Ocean of Milk, a tremendous feat requiring tremendous power. Eventually, the Ocean of Milk provides 14 treasures, which are divided amongst the gods and asuras. Vishnu succeeds in securing amrita for the gods, although the asura Rahuketu consumes a fraction. When Vishnu decapitates Rahuketu, his head and body survive—they become Rahu and Ketu, respectively.

*Adventure Ideas*: Replicating the canonical Samudra Manthan requires a party of gods or egregiously bountiful deus ex machina. The gods and asuras used a mountain as the churning rod and a colossal snake as the churning rod. However, a party of gods is not ridiculous; your characters can yearn for immortality, thereby preserving the fear of mortality. Alternatively, your characters may complete the campaign by initiating the Samudra Manthan and transcending as gods. Notably, those gods who participated were not intrinsically immortal; those deities who supervised (like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, and Parvati) were intrinsically immortal. Thus, your characters may become gods (as opposed to Gods). Finally, you might prefer to present the story of the asuras, casting your party as Monstrous Races. The asuras certainly usurped Indra’s kingdom but the gods consistently aggravated and goaded the asuras.

**Vastraharan, or Disrobing, of Draupadi (Mahabharata)**: In the royal court of Hastinapur, Shakuni, uncle of Duryodhana, conspires to rob the Pandavas of their palace. He invokes the gambling addiction of the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira; the eldest Pandava will play Parcheesi with Shakuni, whose dice superiority is unmatched. Foolishly, Yudhishthira gambles away his property and his brothers. Finally, in a bid to regain everything, the eldest Pandava is goaded into gambling away Draupadi, the shared wife of the Pandavas. Again, Yudhishthira loses; Draupadi is dragged into the royal court, and she is disrobed. Fortunately, Krishna intervenes and preserves her honour. Draupadi then threatens to curse the Kauravas, but their father offers her boons to satiate her vengeance. Thus, the Pandavas are spared by their wife: she demands Yudhishthira receive his property and brothers. Before they depart, Draupadi vows to wash her hair with the blood of Dushasana, the man who nearly violated her.

*Adventure Ideas*: The Disrobing of Draupadi is a pivotal point in the Mahabharata; this is among the inciting incidents of the Kurukshetra War. Moreover, it crystallizes Draupadi’s revenge: previously, she offered her support to her husbands, but now she too desires to witness the downfall of the Kauravas. It melds the traditional and subverted damsel in distress, as Draupadi is saved by Krishna but herself saves the Pandavas. Your players might partake in Parcheesi, later sparing Draupadi; or, perhaps one of your characters replaces Draupadi. In some folk retellings of the Mahabharata, Draupadi is witnessed in the Kurukshetra War as the goddess Kali, slaughtering the Kauravas and eating their corpses. If your substituted Draupadi is a Barbarian, have someone cast Enlarge on her so she can terrorize the enemies.

# Characters

**Ahilya**: Wife of the supremely arrogant sage Gautama, Ahilya was cursed with petrification by her husband. She copulated with Indra, king of the gods, who disguised himself as Gautama; earlier texts describe her piercing his disguise, whereas later texts contend she was raped. Ahilya must observe severe penance to transcend her curse. However, magic capable of undoing the curse may exist.

**Banasura**: The thousand-armed asura (demigod) king zealously rules his kingdom, intimidating and subjugating countless kings—and gods. Banasura is protected by Shiva, god of destruction and meditation; his security has encouraged Banasura to escalate his cruelty. Banasura can only be killed when Shiva revokes his security or is rendered inactive; alternatively, Banasura can only be killed by a virgin girl.

**Durga**: When the bull-demon Mahishasura displaces the gods, his boon from Brahma makes him invulnerable to the powers of the Trimurti: only a woman can kill him. Thus, Adi Shakti manifests as Durga, goddess of divinity, victory, and war. Durga wars with Mahishasura for nine nights and ten days, finally slaying the demon on the tenth day. She has slaughtered more demons than any god, and her powers surpass the Trimurti. In *Kali Yuga*, or the Age of Discord, worship of Durga is prescribed.

**Gandhari**: Dhritarashtra is tirelessly supported by his queen consort, Gandhari. She blinds herself with a blindfold to emulate her husband’s blindness; her support also manifests as guidance, and she never wavers from moral objectivity. Unfortunately, Gandhari is destined to witness the deaths of her hundred sons.

**Harishchandra**: Married to 100 wives but without any sons, Harishchandra promises to offer a sacrifice to the god Varuna if he provides the king with an heir. When Harishchandra’s heir is born, he routinely postpones the sacrifice until his son is an adult. Varuna curses the king with an excruciating stomach illness; his son flees, refusing the sacrifice. Eventually, his son convinces Harishchandra to sacrifice a sage, but the sage fervently prays for sanctuary. Miraculously, the sage’s prayers appease Varuna, who removes the stipulation and cures the king. Alternatively, Harishchandra is an altruistic king who mistakenly interrupts the meditation of the sage Vishwamitra. As recompense, Harishchandra offers the sage anything; the sage demands everything the king owns, aside from himself and his family. Thus, Harishchandra initiates a gruelling journey where Vishwamitra consistently punishes the king. Finally, Vishwamitra reveals his tribulations were a test; Harishchandra proves his piety, and he is guaranteed a seat in heaven.

**Indra**: King of the gods, Indra is as lascivious as he is powerful. His powers are dwarfed by the Trimurti and Tridevi, and he lives in constant fear of demons and demigods claiming his throne. Indra routinely consorts with the wives of sages, who either willingly offer themselves or are raped by him. After copulating with Ahilya, Indra is cursed by sage Gautama—his 1000 eyes become 10000 vulvae.

**Jalandhara**: When Indra offends Shiva, the god of destruction opens his third eye; Parvati spares Indra, and Shiva unleashes his wrath into the sea. Thus, Jalandhara is born: physically identical to Shiva, he is wrath incarnate. He quickly subjugates the demons, later desiring Shiva’s throne atop Kailash. Jalandhara’s immortality is secured by his wife, Vrinda; her chastity safeguards him from harm. Jalandhara’s wrath is exacerbated when Vishnu, disguised as Jalandhara, copulates with Vrinda, thereby shattering her chastity. Vrinda immolates herself, ashamed of her failure to remain loyal. Now, Jalandhara is on the warpath; only Shiva can stop him.

**Kali**: When Durga battles the demon Raktabeeja, whose blood generated clones, she found herself unable to annihilate his replicas simultaneously. Thus, she unleashes the energy from her third eye—this energy manifests as Kali, goddess of time and change. Kali is the void; she is as black as night and garlanded with 52 heads, representing the 52 letters of the alphabet. Violent and bloodthirsty, she stands on Shiva: the god of destruction is subjugated by the goddess of time.

**Lavanasura**: While Rama is exiled, the demon Lavanasura terrorizes settlements and sages. He is diametrically opposite to his father, the respected and peaceful demon king Madhu. After realizing his son’s insatiable appetite for strife, Madhu succumbed to his shame and drowned himself. Citizens and sages alike desperately search for Rama—or an adequate substitute.

**Mandodari**: Where Ravana is learned but arrogant, Mandodari is sagacious and compassionate. Despite Ravana kidnapping her during her marriage to another man, Mandodari stalwartly loves her erring husband. She urges him to think rationally and advocates for the release of Sita. Mandodari’s devotion and chastity earn her Amrita, the nectar of immortality. However, she offers it to Ravana—a testament to the extent of her devotion.

**Narakasura**: Originally a pious and magnanimous king, Narakasura becomes obsessed with amassing power. Soon, he subjugates the nearby kingdoms, mistreating his vassals; he is particularly cruel to their women. This cruelty culminates in Narakasura kidnapping 16,000 women, who he desires to copulate with, so he can produce thousands of sons. However, Narakasura is killed by Krishna and his consort Satyabhama; Krishna marries the kidnapped women, thereby preserving their honour. Alternatively, Narakasura is killed by Kamakhya, goddess of desire. He lusts after her; she promises to forfeit herself if he can build a ladder to her celestial palace before sunrise. As Narakasura assembles stones to climb, Kamakhya forces a rooster to crow, fooling Narakasura into thinking he failed. When he retaliates, Kamakhya slaughters him and liberates his prisoners.

**Parashurama**: When his parents’ cow, blessed with the ability to fulfil any wish, is stolen by an envious king, Parashurama (a Brahmin) challenges the king to martial combat. He kills the king using his axe, later slaughtering those of the Kshatriya (warrior) caste when they retaliate. Parashurama’s father is disappointed, as Brahmins are never to succumb to anger; he is instructed to undertake a pilgrimage to absolve himself. However, when warriors kill his father, Parashurama again slaughters his enemies. He continues this cycle of anger, murder, and repentance eternally—Parashurama is immortal, his anger never subsiding.

**Raktabeeja**: Undoubtedly the most malevolent demon in the demon-king Shumbha’s army, Raktabeeja wields the boon of regeneration. Every drop of his blood generates a clone identical in physical prowess. He rampantly terrorizes the gods, but his primary responsibility is relaying Shumbha’s marriage proposal to Durga. The gods are incapable of killing Raktabeeja; only Durga can slay the demon. When her anger manifests as Kali, the goddess of time consumes the clones. She drinks the blood of Raktabeeja while Durga injures him—the battle culminates with Durga eviscerating Raktabeeja, and both goddesses eagerly drink his blood.

**Savitri**: Married to a man who is destined to die in one year, Savitri is the epitome of purity and wisdom. When her husband’s death is imminent, she accompanies him into the forest; he dies in her lap. However, Savitri refuses to concede her husband’s soul to Yama, god of death. She extolls Yama and offers obeisance, impressing him with her devotion. Yama promises her any boon: first, Savitri asks for the restoration of her father-in-law’s sight; then, she requests 100 sons for her father; finally, she requests 100 sons for herself. Yama agrees but Savitri reminds him she needs her husband. Thus, Savitri retrieves the soul of her husband from the god of death.  

**Tataka**: Originally an exquisitely beautiful princess, Tataka is cursed by sage Agastya when she attempts to kill him for cursing her husband. Tataka is immediately transformed into a colossal, repugnant cannibal; the beautiful princess becomes a starving demon. She terrorizes a forest and the settlements nearby, consuming anyone who ventures close. Rama and Lakshmana are dispatched to end her reign of terror; Rama kills Tataka by piercing her heart with his arrows.

**Vedavati**: Where other women desire capable warriors as husbands, Vedavati desires only Vishnu. She adopts asceticism to please him; she retires to the forest, where she chants Vishnu’s name for years. The Rakshasa king Ravana observes Vedavati and immediately desires her, overpowering her while she chants. Enraged by his iniquity, Vedavati immolates herself—but not before cursing her defiler. She vows to return in another life and kill Ravana. Thus, Vedavati is reborn as Sita, the agent of Ravana’s demise.

**Yama**: When the first human died, he inherited the realm of the dead; thus, Yama became the god of death. He rides a buffalo and displays terrible countenance and is as dark as rain clouds. Yama also governs righteousness and justice, serving as the wise teacher to competent disciples. His sister, Yami, is the goddess of life; she eternally mourns his death until the gods create night, allowing Yami to process her pain as time passes. 

# Artefacts 

**Amrita**: The nectar of immortality is perennially desired by demigods, demons, and mortals. It is safeguarded by those deities who are intrinsically immortal. Notably, those who drink Amrita are not invulnerable to dissolution; the wheel of time spares no one.

**Dakshinavarti Shankh**: Where the shankh (conch) shell commonly spirals to the left, the exceedingly rare Dakshinavarthi Shankh spirals to the right. Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity and fortune, resides in this shankh; its possessor is blessed with emotional, material, and spiritual fulfilment. Additionally, bathing oneself with this shankh absolves oneself of all sins, including those committed in past lives. The spiralling of the shankh symbolizes the cyclic nature of time.

**Damaru**: The mystical drum of Shiva, it is tied to the shaft of his Trishula. When played, the Damaru produces the sounds and syllables which originated the universe. Thus, it governs creation and destruction.

**Halahala**: A destructive poison capable of harming gods, Halahala is held in the neck of Shiva. When he consumed the poison to spare the gods, Parvati stabilized him by preventing Halahala from spreading beyond his neck. Where Amrita promises immortality, Halahala guarantees tremendously painful death.

**Indrajaala**: When demons threatened mortals, Indra conquered the demons using sorcery. He fashioned the illusory Indrajaala, or Indra’s Net. It ensnares enemies using the power of illusions, convincing them they are immobilized and impotent. The Net’s magic is incomparable; affected creatures are harmed by their own weapons and are overwhelmed by despondency.

**Kalpavriksha**: The tree of life possesses unrivalled mystical properties; it manifests the wishes of anyone who pays it obeisance.

**Kamandalu**: An oblong water pot made of a dry gourd, it holds the nectar and water of life. Those who possess a Kamandalu demonstrate invincibility and invulnerability. The Kamandalu can be wielded offensively; the goddess Brahmani uses its holy water to desiccate demons.

**Kapala**: A skullcap fashioned from demons, Kapalas expedite transcendental meditation. Moreover, libations (especially blood) are readily received by deities when offered in Kapalas. Durga and Kali infuse their devotees with unmatched courage and power when propitiated with blood or wine in Kapalas.

**Mundamala**: The garland of heads or skulls is as gruesome as it is supreme. Worn by goddesses like Kali and Chinnamastika (the self-decapitated goddess), the Mundamala consists of 52 heads or skulls, signifying the 52 letters of the alphabet. Thus, he or she who possesses the Mundamala wields the power of the primordial syllable. The garland inures its wearer to the fears of time and death. Moreover, it allows the individual to clearly comprehend Kali as the Supreme Godhead, thereby revealing the esoteric secrets of the universe.

**Sanjeevani**: A mystical plant which grows exclusively on Dronagiri, a mountain peak, Sanjeevani is a universal remedy. It can cure any malady, regardless of the agent; biological and mystical diseases included. 

# Astras: Immensely powerful weapons crafted by the gods; each required an invocation of the presiding deity, and many were capable of cataclysmic damage.

*Brahma-Astra*: A projectile with a single head of Brahma at its tip, the Brahmaastra can annihilate the world. It can be activated by invoking Brahma and is the only Astra capable of damaging the Brahma Kavach. Its wielder needs to wield it cautiously; when released, it cannot be inactivated. The Brahmaastra manifests a massive fireball that consumes only its target or anything the wielder desires.

*Brahmadanda*: Entirely defensive, the Brahmadanda neutralizes any Astra, including the Brahma-Astra and Brahmashirsha-Astra. 

*Brahmashirsha-Astra*: The evolution of the Brahma-Astra, this weapon possesses the missing fifth head of Brahma. It demonstrates the capacity of killing even gods. When activated, the Brahmashirsha-Astra summons a meteor shower of catastrophic power.

*Khadga*: A vicious double-edged sword, the Khadga strikes down delusion, desire, and hatred. It can only be activated by invoking Durga or any goddesses enumerated in the Khadgamala, or Garland of Swords—a hymn extolling the virtues of those goddesses associated with Durga.

*Khatvanga*: A menacing skull-topped staff, the Khatvanga is used by Kali to brutalize demons. Only her invocation can activate it; even the gods are vulnerable to its power. The Khatvanga can consume any Astra, thereby inactivating the Astra. When Kali initiates the dissolution of the universe, she uses the Khatvanga to dematerialize reality.

*Sudarshana Chakra*: A deadly discus representing the wheel of time, the Sudarshana Chakra decapitates the unrighteous. It can be activated by invoking Vishnu, Shiva, or Durga, and can only be inactivated by the three deities. 

*Trishula*: A trident whose middle blade is longer than its outer blades, the Trishula can decimate anything. It can be activated by invoking either Shiva or Durga; similarly, only Shiva or Durga can inactivate the Trishula. When wielded by the gods, the Trishula is used to massacre numerous demons.

*Vel*: A mighty spear used to kill the demon Tarakasura, the Vel is a manifestation of Parvati’s power, which she gifted to her son Kartikeya. It can only be activated by invoking Parvati (or Durga) or Kartikeya.",1,"Mythological Indian Adventures, Artefacts, Characters, and Settings"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,17,211,"So, I'm a lazy DM, sometimes. Picking and choosing custom magic items that make the most sense in context, and that the players will enjoy the most, is what I usually do, but sometimes I just feel like rolling the bones and seeing what RNG gives my players.

That being said, Xanathar's Guide to Everything has a list of common magic items that I've fallen in love with, but it didn't provide a table that you can roll on to hand them out to your players. To rectify this, I decided the easiest and best way to get what I wanted was just to re-make the ""Magic Item Table A"" you can find in the DMG.

So, without further ado, here it is:

#**Magic Item Table A**

d100 | Magic Item

01-20 | Potion of healing

Just use it exactly the same way you'd use the default Magic Item Table A in the DMG. The more astute of you might notice that 2nd level spell scrolls and greater potions of healing aren't present in this table. Simply put, to fit this much stuff in I had to make some sacrifices.

Edit: Someone requested a version of the table with 2nd level spells scrolls and greater healing potions still in it. If you want to do this too, just replace 01-50 of the original table with this:

d100 | Magic Item

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,33,394,"Hey /r/DnDBehindTheScreen, I'm writing a series of Adventure Hooks as a writing exercise, and I would like to share them with my fellow DMs. Please feel free to steal any and everything I post, and if you have any suggestions for improvement I'd love to hear them! This hook was inspired by our community roundtable about dungeons, specifically /u/Echo8me's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9yituh/community_roundtable_talking_dungeons/ea21uc5).

# The Colossus

*There are some incredible beings in the multiverse, creators and destroyers of life and technology. Many of those creations have served their purpose and been forgotten over the millenia, their remains overgrown or disassembled for practical use. But there is one, deep in the Spine of the World, whose slumber has been disturbed.*

*The Colossus is a construct the size of a titan, at best estimate over 80’ tall, that has slept in the mountains so long that the rock has grown around its frame. The shield dwarves of Mirabar believe the spirit of the Colossus has returned and will rip it free of the mountain, laying waste to civilization if it cannot be stopped.*

The Colossus is inhabited by Ragnar the Demilich, who has returned from her otherworldly travels. she has been making tremors and quakes in the mountain as she tests her control over the Colossus. She has been doing this for two reasons:

1. Her off world travelling has given her a theoretical understanding of the mechanics of the Colossus, but she is still running practical tests before taking the big guy out for a spin.
2. She knows that these tremors will draw in powerful dwarves and adventurers, who will make excellent souls to refill her phylactery. For her plan to work, she needs enough souls to power the Colossus, giving her an infinitely powerful physical form.

Ragnar was a dwarven wizard of great renown who led a successful adventuring life with her companions. She grew up a child of neglect and abuse, and devoted her life to making herself stronger. She made many rivals throughout her life, and became increasingly wary to the point of paranoia that they were making attempts to steal her power away. She developed a neurological condition that caused her body to fail, and when the clerics and healers couldn't find a cure, she became obsessed with hoarding power and crushing her enemies. She became a Lich, using the husk of an ancient construct as her lair. She started hoarding dwarven knowledge of constructs to try and make the Colossus work, but when she ran out of leads, she became a Demilich and started off world travelling.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,36,78,"Hi All,

Today I'd like you to discuss your world's economies - how they function, how they've changed, what problems/lessons you've encountered along the way, and anything that might help another DM to approach this worldbuilding aspect.

Thanks BTS, and I'll just be over here counting mah gold!",1,Community Roundtable: Talking Economies
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,46,"This post is for the DM out there who has always wanted to build a setting, but feels like it is too much work. The method that works for me is to design by outline - I create a sandbox and fill it theme parks and attractions. With this method, I can create an entire world in less than an hour and even be ready to run the first adventure. Additionally, I can use my outline of theme park and attraction hooks to let the players choose their path for the next adventure and keep the story off the rails.

If you just want to get the free world from me (The Realm of Hythe), then I have it all packed up for you in a [google doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FnAKTNF0PexcAIT_htFqjo8EijkaFxfa).

If you want to try to build one yourself, then please read ahead. Happy building!

**TLDR** \- *The trick is to start with a map (the sandbox) and populate it with points of interest (theme parks) and then create different plot hooks (attractions) within each theme park. Setup the first adventure at one of the theme parks and insert the hooks you already prepared on the outline (from all over the sandbox) throughout. Then, let the players decide the direction they want to go before they leave the first session so you can build out and plan their next theme park and/or attraction in detail. Rinse and repeat and the world will build itself in no more time than it takes to make one adventure.*

**The Sandbox**

Ok, so before you do anything, you need to build the outer boundaries, and unless you just really want to delve into the planar system right away, this means a world for the adventures to take place in. This is your sandbox, *players can go anywhere in this place*. For this post, I made a [realm called Hythe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19G-XfZPDBORk3NSa_dCjzdLmbXJkRHFI). To create the sandbox, I did my best *Jackson Pollock* blobby splotch coloring using the free version of [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) and it took about 15 minutes to make. *For your sandbox, it is important to give yourself different options for environment.* I wanted to make sure I could go coastal or desert, rocky foothills, forest, dead forest (undead perhaps) and mountains. I even broke down and put in a river in case for some reason I wanted to do something with a river.

**Theme Parks**

Once you have a sandbox, you need to create points of interest - think of these as theme parks. I don’t need stories yet for all of them, so I am just plopping down things; and again I am going for variety here so I can give myself options. For settlements in Hythe, I wanted some towers, big cities, small villages, fortified outposts and neutral sites. I used a random name generator online for the names of all the points of interest. After I was done putting down cities, I felt like I could set up two different alliances among the cities so I have an orange faction and a green faction (marked by the color of their nameplate on the map). If you are working on a bigger map with more theme parks, try three factions - just make sure to always include some neutral cites. *Having neutral cites is important to give the potentially competitive factions in the world something to compete for, and it also gives the players an opportunity to perhaps play both sides, or ignore faction squabbling entirely if they don’t want to get involved.*

**Attractions**

At each theme park, you need things for players to do - think of these as attractions. These can be quest hooks, shops, social encounters, personal story plot points (from character backstories) or dungeons. For the port city of Calcheck, where in this example I am going to start players in the seed adventure, I have decided I want to have a few shops, an inn/tavern, a noble house with some of their lesser lords and retainers, and finally some docks. For each of these areas, *I want to make them attractive* (they are supposed to be attractions after all) so this means interesting NPC with rumors, skill challenges, puzzles, social and combat encounters. *You can choose to put more emphasis on the types of attractions your table enjoys or keep it balanced*. Once you get to this stage (adding attractions to a theme park), you are beginning the process of designing by outlining. It is important in each theme park to build big attractions, medium and small ones. *I also make it a point to include as many personal story elements that make sense if my players have written backstories with goals, bonds etc.*

**Plot Outlining (developing just what you need)**

In outlining it is important to develop in stages. Many make the mistake of basically trying to brute force their entire story from line one to “the end,” and this leads to stress and mega bad writer’s block. *Start easy, get the whole world out with only keywords or short phrases first.* This is called a topic outline. For Hythe, it looks like this (looks better in the doc - reddit posts don't handle outline spacing well):

Hythe

1. Regions

&gt;Pine Forest (name): Monastary (Orrinshire); Port city - orange faction (Calcheck)  
&gt;  
&gt;Oak Forest (name): Village - orange faction (Cardend); Fort Settlement - orange faction (Mirstone); River Towers  
&gt;  
&gt;Hills (name): The Mountain (name); Tower (Dalmellington)  
&gt;  
&gt;Desert (name): Fort Settlement - green faction (Northpass); Outpost - green faction (Westray); Village - green faction (Goulcrest)  
&gt;  
&gt;Dead trees (name): Tower (Snowbush)  
&gt;  
&gt;Mountains (name): BBEG (name)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the next step is to revise (not rewrite) this topic outline into a sentence outline with the parts I want to add more detail to. I want to focus my sentence outline on *identifying connections between theme parks and potential struggles that could end up becoming attractions for players*.

1. Pine Forest (name)

&gt;Monastery (Orrinshire) - A monk is missing after leaving on a vision quest to investigate a new great danger near the abandoned tower of Snowbush.  
&gt;  
&gt;Port city - orange faction (Calcheck) - Pirates have taken the noble’s daughter hostage and are ransoming her life in exchange for the life of their capitan, who is the only one who knows the location of their buried treasure.

2. Oak Forest (name)

&gt;Village - orange faction (Cardend) - This small village is divided, the mayor is dead (murdered) and the two most prominent families in town have blamed each other for the crime.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fort Settlement - orange faction (Mirstone) - An intercepted dispatch from (green faction) suggests they may try to cross the river and invade (orange faction) territory.  
&gt;  
&gt;River Towers - trade activity has been suspiciously quiet from the (orange faction)

3. Hills (name)

&gt;The Mountain (name) - workers a gemstone mine deep in the mountains has recently uncovered an ancient temple to a strange unknown god with a dragon symbol.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tower (Dalmellington) - The Cult of Dal’Mel conducts experiments and studies here to determine the cause of the tree rot in the (dead tree area).

4. Desert (name)

&gt;Fort Settlement - green faction (Northpass) - The fort is in high alert after hearing rumors of a dragon attacking Goulcrest to the south. Trade supplies and soldiers have been rerouted south in response to the calls for aid.  
&gt;  
&gt;Outpost - green faction (Westray) - The coastal pirate activity near Westray has slowed down, which is not good. This barren outpost needs the supplies the privateers bring from other parts of the realm.  
&gt;  
&gt;Village - green faction (Goulcrest) - This remote village survives despite the arid and harsh climate. The recent dragon attack hasn’t broken the resolve of these stoic people, but it doesn’t look good.

5. Dead trees (name)

&gt;Tower (Snowbush) - The tower of legend used to be the home of a great wizard, the one who banished the dragon menace in a bygone age. It has sat empty for generations.

6. Mountains (name)

&gt;BBEG (name) - The lair of the dragon.

Notice in the sentence outline that each of these theme parks have a simple adventure hook. This will be critically important to pull off the next part of this world building method - *getting your players to hook themselves*. The sentences in this outline are the ones I will systematically implant in the the first table session - the seed adventure.

**Seed Session and Hooking Forward**

Now the tricky part: *getting that first session planned out and then extending the story into future adventures*.

First, the trick, then the explanation. Run the seed adventure, and then (at the end of the adventure), give the players a chance to discuss and decide where they will head next. *Doing this at the end of a session lets you know what theme park or attraction(s) you need to flesh out for next session and it maintains player agency so you aren’t railroading them.* Hook them forward - do this at the end of every adventure.

Hooking forward you can design efficiently, because *you know where the players want to go* and *generally what the want to try and accomplish*. Your world will grow more alive and deep naturally over time. In world building gone wrong, a DM tries to either to plan ahead a huge campaign in its entirety (and gets burned out), or the DM gets frustrated because they players “go the wrong way” or don’t follow the story they planned. Use the seed, then hook it forward to avoid burnout and railroad rage.

**Building the Seed Adventure**

For the seed adventure in Hythe, I want to try to balance my encounter types and keep it simple (especially if it is a new group). My main goal is to get the players to work together and build a bond. I am going to take my world and build out one adventure, *just one*. Building anything more than that is *too much*. *Put any epiphany or serendipitous musings in the general sentence outline - that can extend as much as you want as it simply adds more attractions to theme parks).*

I am starting this group in Calcheck, so I’ll start with what I have in my sentence outline.

&gt;*Port city - orange faction (Calcheck) - Pirates have taken the noble’s daughter hostage and are ransoming her life in exchange for the life of their captain, who is the only one who knows the location of their buried treasure.*

Ok, this is a port city with successful trade, so I will need some shops for sure, and I can use [donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/magic/shop.html) if I am in a pinch to create the flavor for me and, if I am feeling really lazy, I can just use the item list it generates too. I usually adjust the pricing on the items if I auto generate to fit the economy I want to use. (I included shops I auto generated in the finished doc for [Hythe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19G-XfZPDBORk3NSa_dCjzdLmbXJkRHFI)).

An Inn/tavern, I prefer not to go all automated donjon on my taverns as players spend more meaningful time there. The tavern where the players will start is *The Skinny Pigeon*. It is in the dock district and generally full of sailors, dock workers and the occasional lower level nobleman who might be in the area checking on trade. When the players are inside, there are several NPC - each person has a rumor or something the players can gain. *The goal here is to give several different opportunities with good, neutral and evil as well as lawful/chaotic flavors to lead the players to the seed encounter (settling the pirate/noble daughter problem).*

&gt;**A quick aside on NPC design**  
&gt;  
&gt;I try to give NPC a bond, flaw and a goal/ideal, and I always have one rumor-monger NPC that is usually a barkeeper or a tavern waitress: *somebody who the players will have an easy opportunity to chat with and would reasonably have access to lots of varied information*. In The Skinny Pigeon, it’s Arvie Purifoy - the tavern keeper and his rumors are *all from the sentence outline that I wrote earlier* (all potential story hooks for future adventures and other theme parks). Advertise your theme parks through the rumor-monger; it is a small investment, but pays dividends and keeps you off the railroad tracks.

**The Skinny Pigeon (realm content)**

**Ringo Olmez** \- *A pirate who has just left his crew in mutiny. He left because he refused to be a part of kidnapping a noble woman; he sees himself as a “romantic.” He will exchange information about where the pirates are holding the damsel for money or other arrangements that provide him safe land passage to the next town.* ***Good/Neutral/Evil plot hook for seed adventure.***

**Gunnar Wideman** \- *A guard who just finished duty at the small jailhouse. He is drunk and is eager to share the story about how (big scary pirate captain) offered him riches beyond belief if he helped him escape the jail and get back to his ship in the bay.* ***Evil plot hook for seed adventure.***

**Berne Martell and Zenebio Bertone** \- *Two lesser noble discussing the recent capture of (bad pirate guy) and the resulting ransom of (noble’s daughter). They are discussing how they will turn whatever (nobleman) tries to do to their advantage - either he is soft on privateering or he is callous and unfatherly. They will offer the players none of their attention (unless one of the player backgrounds is of nobility in which case they will threaten the player not to meddle by trying to be all goody-two-shoes and helping the nobleman).* ***Lawful plot hook/complication for seed adventure.***

**Jasen De Candia** \- *He is the secret love of (noble’s daughter). He wants to help rescue her, but he can’t. Her father, (the nobleman), has forbidden he go near her or else (the nobleman) will surely have him arrested and execute him. He offers to give the players his proposed wedding ring (a* ***ring*** *with ram’s horns on it - see description below) if they can rescue her, but bring her to a specific spot on the coast (he has drawn a map) instead of returning her to her father.* ***Chaotic plot hook for seed adventure.***

&gt;***Ring of the Ram***  
&gt;  
&gt;*This ring has 3 Charges, and it regains 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its Charges to Attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its Attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's Charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.*

**Neo Ragucci** \- *He is a vassal for (the nobleman) coming into the tavern to post a notice that any would be rescuers for hire could compete in a tryout. It is ongoing in the noble courtyard and (the nobleman) will select his hirelings at sunset.* ***Neutral plot hook for seed adventure.***

**Arvie Purifoy** \- *The tavern keeper who has bunches of rumors from around the region. He has head that the mayor of Cardend is dead (murdered) and the two most prominent families in town have blamed each other for the crime; met a monk from Orrinshire who was looking for one of his missing brothers, who said he was heading off on some fool quest to the dead forest in the south; A strange discovery came out of the gemstone mine in the (rocky hills); and the fort over at Mirstone is settling in for an expected attack from the (green faction).* ***NPC Rumor-Monger provides future plot hooks from around the sandbox.***

**Concept Map Outlining**

Ok, so from here is where I start using the web outline stuff (it’s called a concept map) that u/mimir-ion describes in [great detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/96aek3/complex_story_arc_resolvement_plot_mechanics/?utm_source=reddit-android).

Basically, it’s a choice flowchart. I want to have attractions for the nobleman’s area (social encounter, skills contest of some type for the tryout); then I need:

* A docks area to carry out the player’s plan (whether they are trying to save the girl for the nobleman or the lovesick Jasen, or trying to help the pirate captain escape doesn’t matter - what does matter is the players have several choices that all generally lead in some way to resolving the conflict between pirates and the nobleman).
* The nobleman’s area for tryouts or social/diplomatic encounter.
* If the players want to strike a deal with (pirate bad guy) a small jail would probably work.
* And, of course, I need a ship with pirates on it.

Along the way, I want to plant some more hooks and rumors. It would be nice for players discover that: the pirates are contracted to steal goods from this area and bring it to (green faction) at the Westray outpost; and to avoid the southern sea passage because of dragon sightings. *Any chance I can mention a theme park or another conflict from my sentence outline, I am taking it.*

At the end, the player’s succeed (or fail) and then

* They have an opportunity to be rewarded, and perhaps accept other orders from (the nobleman) about something else in Calcheck or helping bolster defenses near Mirstone;
* The (daughter of nobleman) might run away to Orrinshire to join the monastery to avoid being married off against her will;
* If the players took the hook from Jasen, they could work through that plan and then have to avoid the angry nobleman who is trying to capture them;
* If they work with the (pirate bad guy) he could offer them a map to his treasure for helping him (and then perhaps have to fight him when they get there).
* Perhaps the daughter dies, then maybe the nobleman gets angry and they are outcast from (orange faction lands) and they have to head somewhere else.

The point is to let players drive the story - and you as the *DM just have to allow them to do this at the end of the adventure (even if it takes multiple sessions)*. Let them decide where to go next, and that *gives you what attraction or theme park you need to work on for the next adventure*. *Preparing for player agency is why I put so much emphasis on the sentence outline - planting all those rumors about other theme parks or other attractions in their current location will only make it easier to figure out where they want to go next.*

&gt;**A note on personal story hooks**  
&gt;  
&gt;Personal story hooks are the most effective way I have found to get players with different backgrounds to work together. For the seed adventure and for future adventures it offers an opportunity to give players different reasons to work towards the same goal. For instance, here are some ways I might hook different backgrounds into the seed adventure in Calcheck.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Anyone from a noble background** \- I would give them a bond with (the nobleman) they know him, or his daughter, in some way (which can be good or bad).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Anyone from a craftsman background** \- The crafting trade has suffered enough from piracy, this is a chance to take some of them out (or negotiate with them) and gain better profits in trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Anyone from a scholarly or knowledge background** \- This (bad pirate guy) is legendary, the treasure he holds are rumored to be more than material wealth. His treasure supposedly includes great riches in knowledge and arcane power.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Anyone from a martial or soldier background** \- It is your duty to serve the (orange faction) or it is your duty (if you belong to the green faction) to secure this excellent tactical bargaining chip for future opportunities.  
&gt;  
&gt;With more in depth personal stories, the best thing I can use them for is to tie details from their background in with different theme parks. Even if it wasn’t part of your sentence outline, *find a way to make conflict and collaborations that fit a specific player’s story in different areas of your sandbox*. This will be a strong hook to create *movement* \- and if you are afraid of splitting the party, try something in the hook to indicate that the job is too big to do alone or that they will need to bring people they trust.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,6,44,"##***Ilmater - The Patient One***

This is entry #3 in my 6-god project ""The Church of the Light"".

The Church of the Light is a vaguely Catholic/Early Protestantism amalgamation of beliefs that work as a stand-in for middle-ages Christianity in my games. Aside from the State-sponsored ""Church of Justice"", it is the most ubiquitous religion in my world.

Ilmater is the one that actually inspired me to start this project, but he was also the one that I have struggled with the most. I wanted to make a decent Jesus Christ analogue, but canonical Ilmater is already basically that. Anyways, I hope you all enjoy.

Pelor and Prince Nuada are finished; I am still working on Eldatha, Helios and Aurora.

#**Names**

Ilmater, The Patient One, The Lord of Sacrifice, The Scarred God, The Patient Lord

#**Appearance and Symbols**

Within the Church of Light, Ilmater is represented by the first of five rays ray coming off of the symbol of the Holy Sun. His personal symbol is a 5-tailed scourge.

Ilmater himself appears as a human male with light brown hair, and many scars upon his body. However, it is uncommon to find modern depictions that assign such a vulgar ""human"" form to The Flesh of the Light. 

#**Domain**

Mercy. Hope. Redemption. Penance. Forgiveness. Patience. Ilmater represents the hope of forgiveness, and the redemption of those who have endured their just punishment. Ilmater offers mercy and forgiveness to those who are penitent. Ilmater is also revered by criminals, because he often bails them out.


#**Tenets**

- Kindness is for all who walk upon the earth.
- Forgiveness is for those who seek it.
- Punishment is for those who have committed wrongs.
- Mercy is for those who are penitent.
- Patience is for those who do not understand.
- Ilmater is the one who forgives. Let Helios deal with those who are false in their penitence.

#**Dogma**

Ilmater is a simple deity. He is kind, forgiving, merciful and patient. He metes out punishment for those who have wronged others, and takes that punishment upon himself for those who are truly sorry for their wrongdoings. The deeper knowledge of Ilmater’s priests is an additional set of rules that they are to follow, to determine the truth of a penitent criminal’s confession. Priests of Ilmater are compelled by their God to seek out criminals who wish redemption, and bear the burden of that penitent criminal’s punishment. Ilmater does not like to see mortals punished for their wrongdoings, but he believes (like Asmodeus) that mortals cannot understand justice without the threat of punishment. 

- There is no justice without punishment. Blood must be shed to satisfy justice.
- A punishment should fit the crime committed.
- If you determine the repentance of a guilty person, you must yourself, without hesitation, to take up the punishment of the penitent.
- When you undertake the punishment of another, you should not seek divine healing. The pain of healing is a part of the punishment that was meted out.
- Every scar upon your body is a testament to your faith, and a blessing from Ilmater.
- Honor the martyrs who have died in the name of others.

One of the greatest acts of faith that a priest of Ilmater may undertake is the sacrifice of their own life for someone who has been sentenced to execution. Rarely, Ilmater may call one of his priests to exchange themselves for someone that Ilmater wishes to spare from death. Shrines to these martyrs will often contain busts, figurines or their personal effects.

 
#**Allies of the Faith**

Ilmater is one of the Five Rays of the Sun within the Church of Light. He is the firstborn of He-Who-Was, and the elder brother of Pelor. He is “Flesh of The Light”, and thus a fully accepted member of The Pantheon of Light.

Within The Pantheon of Light, Ilmater is most closely allied with Eldatha, Lady of Healing. Although Ilmater does not seek divine healing, he often seeks her help with healing herbs and salves that prevent infections. Eldatha’s doctor-priests often work closely with Ilmater’s faithful.

Criminals who are redeemed by Ilmater’s priests are often closely watched by Helios' inquisitors. Helios is said to visit his fury upon those who would abuse his elder brother’s good nature. 

Ilmater features quite often in the stories about Pelor, and his journeys through the mortal realms. Ilmater is the philosopher of the Holy Triad of Pelor, Ilmater, and Helios. Most commonly, Ilmater is the one who tempers the fury of Helios, or gives Pelor the piece of wisdom needed for an elegant solution to a problem. Other stories about Ilmater feature how he spared some criminal or another from death, and that person went on to do great deeds in the name of The Light.

Bahamut, the Dragon of Justice, is well regarded by Ilmater’s priests. Although they believe that The King of Dragons is not a fit deity to worship, the wisdom and authority of Bahamut’s judges are respected by Ilmater’s priests. Within Bahamut's church, his name is never spoken or written; he is always reverently referred to as ""The Dragon King"", ""The Great Judge"" or ""The Dragon of Justice"". A priest of Ilmater will usually avoid offending a friendly judge/priest of Bahamut, and avoid using the name ""Bahamut"" in such a priest's presence.


#**Enemies of the Faith**

Asmodeus is the chief enemy of Ilmater (and the rest of the Church of Light). Ilmater is especially hated by Asmodeus, as Ilmater is the one who maintains the curse of unhealing upon Asmodeus’ wings. Ilmater is unwavering in his resolution that Asmodeus shall continue to feel the pain of a broken body until he repents for the slaying of Ilmater’s father. 

Zariel and Dispater are also particular enemies of Ilmater, as they are the ones who betrayed He-Who-Was at the Battle of Baator, and turned the tide of the fight in favor of Asmodeus.

#**Clergy and Temples**

Ilmater’s priests often serve at courthouses and jails, where they work in close contact with prisoners. Once a criminal is pronounced guilty, a priest of Ilmater will often speak with them to ascertain whether or not they will repent of their crimes. If a criminal is deemed to be truly penitent, then the priest will record their name and offer themselves to take up the punishment meant for that criminal. Ilmater’s priests are often heavily scarred, blinded and maimed. Ilmater’s priests are often poor, and reliant upon the charity of others. Occasionally, someone who has been redeemed, will sponsor their redeeming priest’s future endeavors.

Priests of Ilmater often have an extensive network of friends within the criminal community. As one might have guessed, redeemed criminals do not always hold to their promises of turning over a new leaf.

Priests of Ilmater are often viewed as sacrosanct by criminals. They are not to be stolen from, and they are not to be harmed. One of the more sure-fire ways to incur the anger of a local crime gang is to harass a priest who has repeatedly bailed them out.

#**Holidays and Festivals**

Ilmater is an ascetic God. He does not call for lavish, public celebrations. He only has one dedicated holiday, and it is celebrated quietly by the faithful.

Ilmater’s only festival is the Day of Remembrance. Seven days after the equinox, criminals who have been redeemed by priests of Ilmater gather at his temples to offer thanks for their redemption. These thanks take the form of gifts to The Church, oaths of dedication to Ilmater or (in the case of The Redeemed who are poor) labor done on behalf of injured priests.

#**Champions and Avatars**

Peter of Gestas was a criminal sentenced to die. On the eve of his execution, Peter had a long conversation with his jailor, who was a faithful man of Ilmater. When dawn came, the jailor offered Peter a chance at redemption. Peter gladly took the man up on his offer, thinking his jailor a madman. The two secretly switched places, and Peter’s life was spared.

The death of the innocent man haunted Peter’s dreams. He read about the work of the priests of Ilmater, and vowed to devote his life to the god who had sent someone to die in his place. Peter forsook his ill-gotten fortune, and spent the rest of his days as a man wholly devoted to Ilmater.

He travels the world, seeking criminals in need of redemption, and giving away his fortune to those most in need. Peter of Gestas is venerated as a living avatar of Ilmater, and as an example of someone who was thought to be too far gone to be redeemed. He is especially known for using his coin to pay off the “blood debts” owed by murderers to the families of their victims. 

Other champions of Ilmater are those who have been called to martyrdom to spare the lives of the penitent. 

#**Known Sects and Cults**

The priesthood of Ilmater have extensive records, and firsthand knowledge, of the kinds of injuries that a person can sustain and still survive. Some heretical priests choose to believe that they are enacting their God’s “higher will”, by ensuring that a criminal is sorry for their crimes. Such priests have conveniently sidestepped the commands of kindness, forgiveness and punishments fitting their crime. Such “enthusiastic” priests are often employed as horrifyingly effective torturers.

Other times, a more “squeamish” priest will not necessarily be the one to carry out the torture, but they will remain on hand as a consultant. These priests rationalize their involvement because they believe that if torture is to be done, it should be performed by someone who does not risk killing or maiming.

Because of these heretics, the priesthood of Ilmater can sometimes have a dark and dreaded reputation. 
Priests who are known to apply their knowledge towards torture are generally shunned by the rest of Ilmater’s faithful. They believe that torture is fundamentally at-odds with the commands of their Lord. However, Ilmater himself has never definitively weighed in on the matter.
",1,Ilmater - The Patient Lord
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,5,31,"Once again, here's a new deity for your campaign! This time, however, we're finally crossing over to the Evil side of the spectrum, bringing you an insidious Demon Lord from the depths (?) of the Abyss.

Today I bring you: Eyg'huol In'kmpleon, Demon Lord of Abandonment!

-----

**Name**: Eyg'huol In'kmpleon (pronounced AY-Goo-Ohl Een-COOM-Pleh-Ohn)

**Titles**: The Neglectful King, The One Who Cares Not

**Divine rank**: Demon Lord

**Position**: Demon Lord of Abandonment, Dereliction and Indifference

**Holy symbol**: A broken bridge over a putrid green circle

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Cleric alignments**: Chaotic Evil, Neutral Evil

**Portfolio**: Abandonment of friends and family, dereliction of duty, apathy, vice

**Domains**: Evil, Chaos, Sloth, Charm

**Allies**: Nerull, Vecna, Shar, Cyric, Mask, Levistus, Juiblex, Obox-Ob, Zuggtmoy

**Enemies**: Pelor, Lathander, Selûne, Corellon Larethian, Moradin, Garl Glittergold, Gruumsh, Kurtulmak, Yondalla, Sune, Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Helm, Hextor, Bane, Tempus, Eilistraee, Lolth, Waukeen, Asmodeus, most other Demon Lords

**Favored weapon**: Crossbow

-----

**Appearance**:

Eyg'huol In'kmpleon has no set form, but unlike other chaotic deities that have shifting countenance, it is not because he's a mercurial deity or one associated with a dynamic force, he simply does not care. When he does bother with taking a particular form, he'll appear as a non-descript humanoid with no distinguishing features and bland clothing that doesn't call attention. Sometimes, he'll even just take the form of the person adressing him, not even bothering to make an effort to make a form on his own. When he speaks, it is in dull, emotionless monotone, and his voice sounds raspy and phlegmy. Any being who makes contact with him forgets what he looks or sounds like moments after concluding any communication with him. Many people theorize that he's not even truly male, just choosing to be referred to as male for the sake of simplicity. As can be expected, Eyg'huol can't be bothered to confirm or deny that rumor.

Some worshippers of the One Who Cares Not theorize that his indifference is actually a front, that he feigns dispassionateness and passivity but is in fact a highly intelligent chessmaster, using his power to seed disillusionment in the service of a grand plan and using his image as a way to avoid Abyssal politics and making himself beneath notice. They use the fact that they themselves are mostly unaffected by the Neglectful King's influence and are empowered to direct it at their enemies instead as evidence of this grander plan. Again, the Neglectful King cannot be bothered to confirm or deny it.

**Abyssal layer**:

Eyg'huol's realm, I'ke (pronounced Ee-KEH), is a cosmic conundrum: it is layer number -1 of the Abyss. Every planar scholar and Demon Lord confirms that it IS an Abyssal layer, but nobody can explain its irrational number or knows where exactly in the Abyss it is located. The realm does not connect to any other Abyssal layer and, except for if he opens a portal to it, is completely inaccessible to outsiders. Eyg'huol has managed to conquer other Abyssal layers in the past, and somehow these layers join up as part of I'ke and basically become blank spots within the Abyss's geography. The number of layers of the Abyss does not change, so said layers are THERE, but anyone who tries to visit them arrives in a huge, empty void, as if the whole layer just disappeared somehow. Every Demon Lord in the Abyss goes mad with rage at not being able to decipher just how Eyg'huol is able to pull this off, and they become even more enraged at how Eyg'huol simply answers that this is so because he doesn't care enough for his layer to be part of the general Abyss and be exposed to its politicking. No one knows if he's mocking his fellow Demon Lords. No one knows if he can muster enough interest to be capable of mockery.

The realm itself is composed of swamplands and plains with scattered buildings throughout, nested within a ring of craggy cavernous mountains. It has a weak sun that is easily covered by the eternal cloud cover, but rain never comes, as if the clouds themselves couldn't be bothered. The swamps rarely go deeper than knee-high, and the creatures that live within them will not attack any newcomers, preferring to lay on the sandy islands that float in the middle of them. The stench of decay is constant, with all plant matter seeming lifeless even as it overtakes all construction. Buildings look haphazardly made and incomplete, and are inhabited by fat and lazy demons who are always intoxicated into a stupor.

A planar traveller who somehow manages to end up in I'ke after facing the perils of the other layers of the Abyss might think that they lucked out in landing there, but within hours, they realize the horrible mistake they've made. The initial relief and amusement start to turn into dread as they start to see all the ways the realm is off. They will walk among demons who stare at them through glassy, disinterested eyes, walk through crumbling buildings and shallow swamps that are only a minor hindrance at most, and start realizing the apathetic nature of the realm. They start to panic as thoughts start to form in the back of their mind, telling them to relax and give up, to just lie down and rest. Eventually, the intruder is struck with a deep sense of apathy and hopelessness, and they will simply lie down and do nothing, just like any other inhabitant of the layer. It is then that the layer strikes, with thousands of insects, vermin and oozes appearing out of nowhere and slowly consuming the intruder. By that moment, the intruder's apathy is such that they find amusement in the pain they feel, being able to feel SOMETHING even as they're being devoured alive.

**Backstory**:

Few of the Lords of the Abyss is as reviled, even by their fellow demons, as Eyg'huol In'kmpleon, the Neglectful King. Holding dominion over the abandonment of duty and family, Eyg'houl is the bane of all structure, hierarchy and law, destroying institutions through seeding disillusionment and apathy. While other Demon Lords break down order through destructive violence or corruption, Eyg'huol does so through more subtle and insiduous means.

Eyg'huol' is old, even by demonic standards, and might very well be just about as old as a being like Asmodeus or Pale Night, and he represents a truly nefarious concept: abandonment. People affected by Eyg'huol's influence betray institutions, shirk responsibilities and abandon familial bonds. However, these actions are not performed through violent means or in the heat of passion. Instead, Eyg'huol plants the seed of a more subtle evil in their hearts: indifference. A knight will abandon his knightly order because his heart is just not in it anymore. A city guard will desert his post in favor of vice and celebration. A father will abandon his child cause taking care of him is too much of a bother. A counselor to the king will betray him to his enemies cause he's just too good for such a lowly job.

Such empty feeling can be much more effective and less detectable as demonic influence than other forms of temptation, for it is a universal feeling. All mortals feel weary of their lot at some moment or another in their lives. Indeed, many say it IS a mortal's lot to suffer and endure through the tedium of existence. The monotony of work, the constant pressure from those in authority, the obligation of family, all these things can grind on a person's psyche. Then, Eyg'huol comes along, and he whispers in the mortal's ear: ""Fuck it."" At this moment, the mortal realizes how hopeless and pointless it all is, and abandons their responsibilities in favor of a carefree life. The worker will throw down his tools and just walk away, the parent packs a bag and rides out of town never to return, the soldier abandons his post. They all seek the pleasure of a carefree life, away from any authority or obligation over them. They look for that lost joy in vice and sin, drinking themselves to a stupor, fornicating with any and all whores, gambling the shirt off their backs.

However, Eyg'huol does not stop there. Eventually, he whispers again in that mortal's ear: ""Fuck it."" At this, the mortal realizes another bitter truth: all the wine, all the games, all the women, they are the same as their former life was: meaningless. They realize they traded one form of slavery for another. The mortal's psyche starts to fracture, looking for deeper extremes in search of feeling. Wicked perversions and taboos start manifesting: the use of hard drugs, violent and aberrant forms of sex, even violence and murder. The more intelligent victims start to look for a more supernatural high: dark magic and profane rituals. And thus, they become damned, one more soul headed to the realm of I'ke.

Settlements which have fallen victim to Eyg'huol's influence quickly fall into filth and disrepair. The inhabitants cannot be bothered to clean and pick up after themselves, repair damage to their homes and city walls, or void themselves off the streets. Many times, creatures that wallow in such filth find their way to these settlements and live among the populace, or even worse, kill them and take over the town. Adventurers who arrive at a settlement that was victim to Eyg'huol will often be greeted by a town in ruins overrun by goblins, troglodytes or even an otyugh.

-----

**Dogma, clergy and temples**:

There is a well-known aphorism that states as follows: ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" Eyg'huol, his worshippers say, IS the nothing, the apathy toward the world that allows evil to flourish.

Cosmological scholars are often surprised that the Demon Lord of Abandonment has some of the most active and dedicated servants of all inhabitants of the Abyss. However, the Neglectful King's servants will be the first to tell you that service to him gives you a disturbing level of power over your enemies. Enemies of worshippers of Eyg'houl have a tendency to see their soldiers deserting their posts, their servants stealing from them and running away, their families becoming apathetic to their plight, and, eventually, they themselves give up and cease to care about their problems, seeking escape in vices. Entire kingdoms have been brought low by just a few worshippers of the Neglectful King whispering the right words in the right ears to seed discontent.

Most worshippers of Eyg'houl are highly intelligent and motivated individuals who have chaffed under what they consider incompetent leaders and institutions. They can be as slow as peasants who've been stepped on by those further up the social ladder or as high as ranking members of the nobility or the clergy. They are, however, never the top rank in their social order. Those, by definition, are the people that worshippers of Eyg'houl choose to victimize.

Like cults of other Demon Lords, servants of Eyg'houl meet in secret and don't advertise their allegiance, and they often feign worship of other deities to mask their service to the Neglectful King. When meeting in secret, they do not go for pomp and ceremony, their worship is strictly utilitarian. They at most perform rituals to communicate with the Neglectful King or one of his servants for instructions and requests for assistance in their schemes. Their most meaningful form of worship is to do perform their grisly work in his name. Every broken family, every defeated army, every destroyed city, they are all sacrifices in the name of the One Who Cares Not.

Clerics of Eyg'huol are his most dedicated and powerful servants, empowered directly by the One Who Cares Not with mystical might to serve his plans. Clerics are the ones who contact Eyg'huol or his servants for orders and direcrion, and they in turn serve as the leaders of his cult. There are many more ""members"" of Eyg'huol's cult, but they're really victims who the true worshippers prey on and utilize as tools for the cult's goals.

-----

**Tenets**:

-The universe does not care for you. Care not. You owe no one but yourself. Anyone else can deal with whatever anyone else expects of them. 

-Society wants you to conform and follow its rules. Conform not. Reject authority and live in freedom, not allowing power over you. Be your own lord and master.

-Family pleads for you to commit. Commit not. The bond of blood only has power over you if you allow it. You owe your family nothing. Those who cannot rely solely on themselves deserve no consideration.

-Religion and state demand that you abstain from worldly pleasures and excesses. Abstain not. Enjoy the pleasures of the flesh, they are more genuine and natural than empty words of dogma and arbitrary laws.

-Mortals will ask you to feel for them. Feel not. Love, hate, anger, joy, there are all distractions from yourself. Through the numbing of emotion, the true pleasures of life are revealed.

-----

**Sects and Cults**:

-**The Fraternity of Forgotten Sons**: The Fraternity of Forgotten Sons is a secret organization with chapters in many a kingdom, composed of minor nobles thirsty for power who unite to share resources and disrupt higher-ranking nobles in bids to obtain greater power. Specifically, they are nobles who have been snubbed by higher nobility or are distant members of a line of succession. The Fraternity is highly ritualistic, participating in profane rites, lustful orgies and bloody sacrifices, all in an effort to earn the favor of their demonic patron. Eventually, a member of the fraternity ""graduates"", when their political rivals fall victims to grave misfortune and they come into power.

This, of course, is a enormous con. Eyg'huol's faithful are taking advantage of the brothers for their own ends, demanding money and material goods in exchange for work they would be doing anyway, and once the brothers are in positions of power, they are now the authorities that Eyg'huol wants destroyed. It is exceedingly common for a brother to graduate and come into power, only for another minor noble they've wronged to take his place in the Fraternity and work for his destruction.

-**The Peddlers of Vice**: The Peddlers are providers of foebidden pleasures and sensual vices, pimps and pushers to a man. Most of them are lax or not even proper members of Eyg'huol's faithful, simply serving the cult for monetary gain. However, spread among them are the true Peddlers, loyal servants of the Neglectful King who spread corruption and perdition through their vice dealing. Alchemists that create new, more powerful and more deadly drugs; brewers who create seductive vintages of wines and ales laced with slow-acting poisons that ravage the body and dull the mind; necromancers who create horrific new sexually transmitted diseases to be spread by the cult's prostitutes; all these are servants to rhe church's mission of societal collapse.

-**The Withered Womb**: The Withered Womb are a subsect of Eyg'huol's cult that dedicates itself to destroying familial bonds, specidically among commoners. They will infiltrate a community and seed their influence on parents and children to bring families to ruin. Families are the backbones of communities, so they can be some of the Neglectful King's most effective agents. Agents of the Womb will infiltrate organizations that focus on the family and civilians, like local churches, schoolhouses, welfare institutions and trade guilds, and plant their seeds of misery there. The Womb works together intimately with the Peddlers of Vice: once a mortal has been corrupted by the Womb, they are referred to the Peddlers for further spiritual degradation.

-**The Dooming Whisper**: Not even other worshippers of Eyg'huol can confirm if the Dooming Whisper is more than just a legend, but whoever he or she is, they're quite real. The Dooming Whisper is Eyg'huol's champion, his most favored servant, who the One Who Cares Not sends to do his bidding when a particular enemy demands his attention. The Dooming Whisper is a master manipulator, a master of disguise (many people theorize he/she might not even be one of the standard races at all, but a doppelganger), and incredibly charming and seductive. Many of the most destructive actions taken by Eyg'huol's followers were not performed by his cult, but by the Dooming Whisper just saying a carefully chosen word here, a caress there, a dagger in this back, a shake of that hand. Whoever he or she is, the Dooming Whisper is powerful socially, physically and mystically, and would be a formidable opponent for any adventurer.

-----

**Allies and enemies**:

Eyg'huol In'kmpleon is unique among the Demon Lords in the universal hate he inspires. The way he's able to corrode all structures and organizations makes him a torn on even other Demon Lords' side, and even many Evil deities find the Neglectful King's influence infuriating. The only deities that deem to ally themselves with Eyg'houl are some of the most evil and dispassionate beings of all the pantheon, deities that benefit immensely from Eyg'huol's disruptive influence and that delight in the destruction of mortals.

Nerull, as the god of evil-caused death, delights in the actions of Eyg'houl's faithful. He's one of the few deities to fully approve of Eyg'houl's actions, and he enjoys how his influence has a tendency to ripple and cause further misery.

While not direct allies (they're not allies with anyone), Vecna and Shar, as deities of secrets, reap the gains from Eyg'huol's influence. The societal chaos that Eyg'huol causes lends itself to lose tongues saying juicy details and skeletons to come out of closets, information that bothe Vecna and Shar can turn into power. Shar also approves of Eyg'huol as an enemy of Selûne.

If any god can be said to be an ally of Eyg'huol, it is Cyric. The Prince of Lies finds Eyg'huol's methods delightful, and their goals coincide often enough that both cults are willing to work with each other on causing misery and destruction. Once in a while, either of the deities' plans will conflict with the other's, but even in these instances, neither of them holds any ill will towards the other, which baffles followers of Cyric to no end, considering their megalomaniacal god's usual attitude. Some people theorize there might be some deeper link between both deities, but these are exactly that, just theories.

Mask is another deity that benefits from the actions of Eyg'houl's cult. When Eyg'huol's worshippers seed chaos in a community, Mask's thieves will infiltrate and reap the benefits.

Of all deities that ally with Eyg'houl, none shocks as much as Levistus. In his vendetta with Asmodeus and his desperation to be free of his icy prison, the Lord of The Fifth is actually willing to do the unthinkable and ally with demons to hinder Asmodeus's plans. Levistus's minions often give Eyg'huol's information of diabolic schemes that Eyg'huol's in turn can infiltrate and destroy. The arrangement is surprisingly lucrative for both parties, and, at least for the moment, Asmodeus is none the wiser. Were Asmodeus to find out about the alliance, Asmodeus would destroy Levistus outright and declare full-on war on Eyg'huol, so both parties tread very carefully.

Juiblex, Obox-Ob and Zuggtmoy are allies of convenience for Eyg'huol. Urban neglect makes a fertile ground for oozes, vermin and fungi.

The celestial deities (Pelor, Lathander, Selûne) and the racial deities (Corellon Larethian, Moradin, Garl Glittergold, Gruumsh, Kurtulmak, Yondalla), as patrons of the mortal races, are some of Eyg'houl's fiercest enemies. Even Gruumsh and Kurtulmak, who are evil in their own right, hate Eyg'huol, seeing his influence on their people as a personal insult.

The urban decay and destruction of passion that Eyg'huol brings forth are anathema to Sune and her faithful, but the breakdown of relationships and death of love he causes are even more abhorrent to her. When Eyg'huol's minions are defeated in a community, servants of Sune often come in to help heal the victims' psyche by reignitng their passion and feelings of love.

Deities of justice and order (Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Helm) are bitter enemies of Eyg'huol for the way he breaks down institutions and corrupts lawful order and bonds of family, friendship and duty. If the Neglectful King's influence is detected in a community where one of these deities' churches has a presence, expect paladins, clerics and inquisitors to quickly arrive and go hunting. Ilmater's church also helps heal the victims by reigniting their humanity though kindness and care.

Hextor and Bane, evil as they are, detest Eyg'huol. As deities of tyranny, their evil influence depends on an established order and hierarchy, structures that Eyg'huol delights on breaking down. They hate the Neglectful King's influence so much, servants of their churches will actually call truces with their enemy Good churches to cooperate in an effort to exterminate his minions. As absurd as the idea might seem, a paladin of Heironeous and a warrior of one of Hextor's orders fighting side-by-side is a possible sight if their common enemy is Eyg'huol's minions.

Tempus finds Eyg'huol's methods to be repugnant, the epitome of dishonor and cowardice. It's one thing to bring an enemy army low in glorious combat, it's another to destroy it from within by sapping away their morale and discipline. Even servants of Tempus have been brought low by demonic influence, and Tempus considers this a declaration of war. To rob fighting men and women of the glories of war is the most evil scene imaginable to Tempus's faithful. Mercenaries of Tempus who are approached to find and destroy servants of Eyg'huol perform the service for free; to them, destroying the minions of the Neglectful King is sacred work.

The threat that Eyg'huol represents is such that even mortal enemies will join to destroy his minions, and no truce is as surprising as that of Eilistraee and Lolth. To Eilistraee, Eyg'huol is a destabilizing force that threatens the free drow under her protection, whom she thinks suffer quite enough already by worshipping her and trying to live in a world that hates them. Lolth finds Eyg'huol's interference in her schemes insulting, and she also flies into rage at drow preferring worshipping him over the Queen of Spiders. Temporary truces between worshippers of both goddesses to destroy a nest of minions of the Neglectful King are not unheard of. Of course, the moment the threat is taken care of, all bets are off and both groups will attack each other mercilessly, but that's preferable to a third party sticking their nose on drow business.

The urban decay and destruction of trust and organization is a concern for Waukeen. Simply put, a community under Eyg'huol's influence cannot sustain business, and this breakdown of commerce and progress just cannot stand. Waukeen's faithful often serve as armorers and suppliers for armed groups that intend to fight the Neglectful King's minions.

Quite obviously, being the incarnation of Lawful Evil itself, Asmodeus is Eyg'huol's bitter enemy, but Asmodeus's hatred of the One Who Cares Not runs much deeper than the one he feels for the ""average"" Demon Lord. Eyg'huol's complete disregard for authority is considered by Asmodeus a direct challenge against Hell's hierarchy, and many of devilkind's schemes in the Material Plane have been unraveled by a servant of Eyg'huol who manages to infiltrate the ranks of Asmodeus's faithful and plant the seeds of apathy and desertion. Asmodeus's anger, however, would be legendary were he to find out of Levistus's cooperation with the Neglectful King. It would probably be the biggest event to happen in Baator since the establishment of the Nine Hells themselves.

And there you have it, peeps! I hope you enjoyed it, and as always, please give me your feedback :)",1,"Eyg'huol In'kmpleon, The Neglectful King"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,88,952,"During my time as a player in table top roleplaying games, I’ve explored countless societies created by several different DMs. Despite all the diversity and interesting quirks in these communities, marriage, for the most part, has usually been represented by the views held on marriage in the modern west, with the occasional monarch or shady rich man having a harem.

Almost every society in our real world has some concept of marriage. But, the views on marriage, and marital practice are incredibly diverse across our societies. I decided to write this out since it seems  this is one area in which Dms seem to almost always opt for the norm instead of letting it help to show the diversity of their world. Also, because the Anthropology minor I completed doesn’t get much use elsewhere.

**Polygyny**: Marriage Wherein a man can have multiple wives.

When it tends to develop:  

Polygyny tends to develop in societies in which women and children share enough of the division of labor that a greater number of either is an asset rather than a burden. In our world, it’s most common in West Africa. This is believed to be associated with their history of hoe-farming and their division of labor. Men and boys tend to clear land for farming, plant the food, build buildings and fences, hunt, etc. A man with multiple wives likely has more children to help with these tasks. Women in these societies are often the ones who tend to their crops, process them, and prepare them. Having multiple wives in one family means they are capable of overseeing larger farms and procuring more food, enhancing their well-being.

If polygyny develops in a society that either looks more like a feudal society, a society that utilizes the help of animals and plows allowing the same work to be done by fewer people, or one that expects males to provide support to their entire family alone, then it will be practiced only by those who have enough wealth to afford it. In this case, having multiple wives changes from an asset to a financial burden.

Note:

In the real world, societies with polygyny are typically less equal among gender lines. It may be practiced in places where there is low male-to-female ratio, possibly due to higher mortality in male infants, deaths in war, or things like slave trades. According to some economists, countries with high rates of polygyny also tend to have lower than average GDPs.

**Polyandry**: Marriage wherein a woman can have multiple husbands.

When it tends to develop:

Polyandry tends to develop within societies living in areas with limited access to resources and farmable land. Perhaps, a society that lives in a mountainous area where much of the soil is too rocky to produce food or one that lives on a small island so they have no room to expand as their population grows. It often comes in the form of fraternal polyandry, which means that a woman will marry two or more husbands who are brothers. Usually, this is to keep their farmable land from being split through inheritance continuously over generations to the point it becomes so small in size that it’s unusable. Rather than inherited land being split between all of a family’s sons, the sons all share the same wife and receive their inheritance together. It’s a different solution to the same problem England looked to solve by mandating that only the eldest son could receive his family’s inherited land.  

This isn’t always the case, though. Plutarch claimed that in Sparta it wasn’t unheard for an older man who took a younger wife to introduce to her a younger man she found interest in. The older man would adopt the child as his own if she was impregnated.  

Notes:

Polyandry is typically found in agrarian societies.  

Even though the woman is taking multiple husbands, and these societies may use matrilineal descent, it doesn’t guarantee equality of the sexes. Sometimes, women will be considered to be the property of multiple men. Other times, these societies will much more egalitarian.

Polyandrous societies often believe in partible paternity. This is the belief that one child can have multiple biological fathers. Since these societies lacked knowledge we now recognize as very basic biology, many of them believed that pregnancy was a cumulative result of recurring intercourse prior to and during the pregnancy, and not a single insemination. Then, there are those like the Trobriand Islanders who believed pregnancy was not caused by the sex itself, but caused by an ancestral spirit, and the typical father-son relationship is replaced by the uncle-nephew relationship.

**Levirate Marriage**: A form of marriage in which a widowed woman is made or expected to marry one of her husbands relatives.

When it tends to develop:

It’s usually seen in societies in which women are either directly or indirectly prohibited from making their own living. It’s often seen as a way to ensure that the widow and her children will be supported and protected. It’s also used to ensure the deceased husband’s handed down inheritance will stay in the patrilineal line. In some cases, this is only practiced if the deceased husband died before he had a child with his widow.

**Ghost Marriage**: A marriage in which one of the spouses is already deceased.

This is an interesting one. One example is the Nuer in Sudan. Upon marriage, the wealth owned by the woman will, traditionally, belong to the man once she marries him. To circumvent this, if a single woman is wealthy, she’ll often marry an already deceased man so that she will be allowed to keep her wealth.  

In some societies in China, women whose fiance died before they were able to get married, would sometimes choose to still go through with the marriage to her now deceased partner. It required her to take a vow of celibacy and she’d move in with her grooms family. Many societies in China practiced ancestor worship, and the women were typically cared for and remembered by her married family and not by her natal family. This provided her an opportunity to both be taken care of by her new married family and also the opportunity to be cared for in death by her new family. There was also a belief that younger brothers shouldn’t marry before their older brothers did. If the eldest brother died before he found the opportunity of marriage, families would often try to find a ghost marriage for the deceased before his younger siblings married in attempt to keep from angering him.

**Same-Sex Marriages**: Rather self-evident.

Yes, yes, this is becoming more and more common and accepted in our real world, but it’s history is extends much further than the 20th century.  

Many Native American societies, for example, had the concept of third genders. Many of them looked at marriage through a lens less concerned with biological sex in favor of an emphasis on societal gender roles. A masculine man marrying a feminine man or a masculine woman marrying a feminine woman would usually be accepted much like a marriage between people of differing sexes. So long as both gender roles were represented. There are also some examples of African and Asian cultures that were traditionally okay with same-sex marriages. Though, these were often inter-generational, with older men marrying younger males or older woman marrying younger females.

**Devadasi**:

This isn’t technically marriage like the rest of them, or at least not in any traditional sense. This was a practice on the Indian Sub-Continent where women would go through a marriage like ceremony and dedicate herself to service of a temple or god. These were women held high regard in society as they cared for temples and were well practiced in traditional forms of dance that were important to their worship. Over time, this practice began to become corrupted, and these women would often end up serving as concubines to male religious leaders.  

**Lack of Marriage**:

There are few societies in which marriage is considered by some to be non-existent, but some semblance of it tends to still exist.

The Mosuo in China practice what is called walking marriage.  

Once a women is considered to be sexually mature, she gets her own bedroom, and is allowed to invite any suitors she may be interested in to come over. If she gets pregnant, the father doesn’t provide for the child. Rather, the child is taken care of the woman’s family, and her brothers will take the role of father to the child. The biological father will do the same thing, and play the role of father for his own nieces and nephews. However, Mosuo women will still typically know who their child’s biological father is, and still share committed and loving, sometimes life-long, relationships with their partners. The biological father often has some interaction with his biological children during important celebrations.

A group I mentioned earlier, The Trobriand Islanders, have a pretty simple system of marriage. They’re very sexually open as a culture, with communities even building vacant huts so that unmarried teenagers have a private place to share with their lovers. If two people want to marry, they let their community know simply by the woman staying in her partners house until the next morning and moving in instead of leaving for home during the night. If they want a divorce, she simply moves out. They get around the problem of the biological father’s lack of support for their children the same way as the Mosuo.

**A few other considerations**:

Does the society have a bride price, dowry, or neither?

Is cousin marriage a taboo, encouraged, or neither?

Do they favor endogamy, exogamy, or just not care either way?

Are the marriages arranged with or without the consent of the spouses, or are spouses chosen solely by the the couple getting married?

There’s also more modern concepts to consider to add even more diversity. Are these societies tolerant of things like free love, ethical polyamory, or polyfidelity?  ",1,The Diversity of Marriage: An interesting worldbuilding opportunity that many people miss

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,51,"I’m going to start by saying I don’t incorporate much planar travel into my games because I don’t really understand how it works properly. But when I do, I try to stay clear of the usual means of spells or items and instead try make it a bit more fun it. Because of this, I have created the Chaos Stream. I think I read something similar to this in the DMG ages back but I might be wrong.

**The Chaos Stream**

The *Chaos Stream* can be found by performing a ritual that takes 10 minutes. Players can learn of this ritual through an old wizard, an ancient text or perhaps by a sentient weapon. The ritual must be performed within 60 feet of a body of water (at least 30 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep). Once the ritual is complete, a portal opens up in the surface of the water leading to the *Chaos Stream* which flows through the *Elemental Chaos*. The *Chaos Stream* is a river of pure energy that looks like a continuous rainbow swiftly flowing past. Because the river flows through the *Elemental Chaos*, you may only get transportation to the *Inner Planes* through it. Once inside the *Chaos Stream*, it appears to be all around you as if even the air is made of it (similar to how warp is depicted in sci fi movies but more colourful). If a character falls in the *Chaos Stream*, they begin taking 1d10 chaos damage at the end of every turn (chaos damage can not be reduced by any means) until they find a way out of the Stream. The portal remains open for up to 1 hour or when the creature that performed the ritual closes it or moves more than 100 feet away. Once on the *Chaos Stream*, reaching any of the Inner Planes takes 1d20+1 hours. Every 1d10 minutes the portal is open, a transport floats past and offers the player/players a ride.

**Transport (1d12)**

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,31,374,"Note: I was inspired to make this post after seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/9zj850/)

If you are one of my players, **stop reading this post immediately**, as it contains some spoilers about the campaign. **(Siegfried Daon, Kuvas Snow, Maxius Ovelonnus, Orro the Dragonborn, or ME SMASH)**

Many of you are already familiar with the concept of using games to help you build or display your world, as /u/mjdoiron24 discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/6m1ejd). Recently, a friend showed me Europa Universalis 4 (EU4), and after playing it for quite some time, I thought I'd share with you here on the sub what I learned from the game that I have now applied to DnD.

Here, I will discuss:

1. EU4 as an inspiration for worldbuilding
2. EU4 as a map structure inspiration and/or mapmaking tool
3. Various other games and what I have learned from them.

# 1. Worldbuilding

In EU4, you choose a country and play as that country. Each country has a government type, a primary culture, provinces that they own, and usually at least one rival, among other things. When making a country, considering these aspects helps make a country seem more believable. 

* Choosing a government type helps you figure out how the social classes may be structured. A monarchy might have a strong aristocratic class but a merchant republic may be more based in an oligarchic structure. A theocracy may be ruled by a bishop or in the case of D&amp;D a high-level cleric.
* Choosing a primary culture helps describes the countries population - sure they may be mostly elves or mostly humans, but are their practices similar to their neighbors?
* Deciding how much territory a country controls can help decide whether they are a powerful empire or a small city-state.
* Deciding their rivals helps lay the basis for future conflicts and wars between nations that can serve as powerful plot hooks.

Also consider trade routes, another thing present in EU4 - where does trade happen? While this may not be too useful for all campaigns, it can help decide where ideas and news is spread the fastest.

# 2. Mapping

In EU4 the map is divded into a large number of provinces. I find that by dividing landmasses into provinces helps get rid of some of the distance tracking between maps - just make up a time to go from one province to a neighboring one, maybe with some modifiers depending on the dominant terrain or the territory (for example, going to or getting out a swamp might take twice as long as going to or from a forest)

From this, you can also go another route. Rather than make your map and divide it into provinces, take an existing map and edit it.

And here's why I didn't want my group to see this, because they'd be thinking about this the whole time:

Online you can find copies of the EU4 map divided into provinces. From there you can use an editing tool (I use paint.net personally) and move the provinces around, reshape them, cut them up, delete some, flip the image, and then recolor it to look the style you want it to be. Usually, your result won't look enough like the original landmass for your players to notice.

For example, [here](https://i.imgur.com/jZ4yMlg.png) is the map of the current area my players are in. How did I make it?

1. Remove all ocean provinces - I delete the lines for ocean provinces because generally speaking your players aren't going to care too much about the sea, and if they do, you probably just want to use a grid for that.
2. Find the region I want to base this map on - I used Europe - If you notice It's just mirrored and rotated so it looks kind of like Japan.
3. Remove easily recognizeable features - I removed Brittany from France, the entirety of Italy and Scandinavia and the portion of Asia Minor in the image I had and most of the Balkans. I took Great Britain and Ireland and I split the different pieces of provinces apart and heavily altered them so they wouldn't be recognizeable. I then took the different pieces and spread them across the map as islands. I then took one piece of Ireland, and attached it to where Denmark used to be. I also cut off most of Iberia and the remaining eastern provinces past where I felt I didn't need more land.
4. Rotate and/or mirror the map - I mirrored the map and then rotated it so the distinctive shape of Europe isn't easy to spot. If you turn your head about 90 degrees to the right you can make out some of it, but with all the removals it can still be hard to discern even then.
5. (Optional) - make a separate copy of the map and color each of the territories according to what country owns them. [Here's mine as an example](https://i.imgur.com/taHjX0W.png) - I chose a different color for each country and then used another color for the 8 city-states I made.

From there, you can either use the map as is or figure out the scale if you want to use real distances. To do this, you can simply find the same region in real life and use Google Maps's Measure Distance feature and use that to make your scale.

# 3. Other games

I've also learned quite a lot from other games as well.

* From the Zombies mode present in some of the Call of Duty games, I learned that combat should be in short bursts of intense action, where the stakes are high at any moment. Obviously this is a personal preference, but I find at least acknowledging the idea helps improve combat for any game.

* From Mark of the Ninja, I learned that meaningful character upgrades can make players feel extremely exciting. Rewards are rewarding.

* From Team Fortress 2 I learned that combat should reward players working together.

* From Tomb of the Necrodancer I learned that music in combat can really help set the pace.
	
Now obviously there are many other lessons you can learn from video games, but I thought I'd share some of my own.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,41,"**Babushka Mishinicha**

&amp;#x200B;

**Neutral Good**

&amp;#x200B;

**Titles**: The Babushka, The Mother of Comfort, The Wisest, The Storyteller, The Record Keeper, The Caregiver, The Warmth of the North

&amp;#x200B;

**Areas of Concern:** Family, Food, History, Medicine, Platonic Love, Charity

&amp;#x200B;

**Worshipers:** Cooks, Nurses, Historians, Scholars, Writers, Bards, Revolutionaries

&amp;#x200B;

**Domains:** Good, Community, Protection, Healing, Liberation, Knowledge

&amp;#x200B;

**Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff

&amp;#x200B;

**Appearance And Symbols:** Babushka Mishinicha is short in stature, stands slightly hunched over, and walks with a slow gait and the help of a quarterstaff that she uses as a cane. Her eyes are a bright blue, and she wears her white hair in a bun at the top of her head. She’s usually dressed in rags and would blend in quite easily among peasants, with the exception of  particularly well-crafted scarf she always wears. The symbol most used among babushkans is a very detailed, beautiful scarf like the one she wears herself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dogma:** Babushka Mishinicha’s followers adhere to what Babushkan scholars and philosophers have termed “the moral expense book.” While she herself has few rules she imposes on her followers, it’s important to her that her followers always act with a conscious effort to bring the most happiness to the greatest number of people possible while minimizing the amount of suffering they cause. Those studying the faith are taught to look at morality the same way the owner of a business would balance their budgets. The instances in which one’s actions produce happiness are akin to profits, and those that cause suffering are akin to expenses. A life well lived, and one that earns the favor The Babushka, are the ones that cause the most happiness in relation to suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tenets:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. When one needs help, help.

2. When one is hungry, feed them.

3. Disobey laws that cause suffering, but do so only as much as you can without imprisonment. One can’t do good from prison.

4. Revolution is the exception. It’s Babushkan duty to take up arms against evil or corrupt governments and replace them.

5. Care for your family.

6. Any person who doesn’t seek to cause or spread suffering is your family.

&amp;#x200B;

**Clergy and Temples:**

&amp;#x200B;

While some larger cities in the North have temples to serve Babushka Mishinicha, they’re a very rare occurrence in most other regions. There are Babushka faithful far and wide, but in most regions her clergy tends to use their own personal homes as temples. While, like any other god, her worshipers pray to her, the temples that do exist house only a small shrine to The Babushka. Most of the space in her temples will be taken up by dining halls, a kitchen, a large shared bedroom, a library, and a music hall. Followers of Babushka Mishinicha consider a shared family style meal or a potluck, writing and reading stories and history, playing music and singing for one another, and offering others a place to stay as the best ways to show their devotion to their god, and this is what her temples tend to be used for.

&amp;#x200B;

**Holidays and Festivals:**

In many Northern Cities, followers of The Babushka partake in The Festival of the Awakened Sun. Many of these cities exist so far in the north that they experience a week or longer in the winter without the sun ever rising, and a week or longer in the summer without the sun ever setting. The Festival of the Awakened Sun takes place during the week that the sun doesn’t set. There’s food, drunken debauchery, gambling, games, and a lot of celebration at all hours of the day. Since the sun doesn’t set during the celebration, citizens have trouble keeping track of the time, and just sleep when they get tired and head back out when they wake, with no real way of knowing if it’s noon or midnight, or even which day it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Those who moved South still tend to hold celebrations with their loved ones around this same time of year. These celebrations will typically only last a day or two, as the sun will still set and the societies at their new homes don’t tend to allow for a week of celebration.",1,Babushka Mishinicha: The Warmth of the North
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,42,310,"I'm nervous that my players circulate this subreddit, so I didn't give away the punchline in the title. So Halse Stormborn and Rokar Wolfsbane, *stop reading this right now*. 

For my next campaign (starting at 5th level, 5e), instead of using a tavern to have players meet, I've decided to start with a dramatic confrontation between an adult white dragon and a storm giant (both CR 13). The two monsters have an epic duel, which causes destruction of parts of the PCs' village. I'm brainstorming some consequences and immediate dangers for the villagers and PCs to fight against. I would love some feedback on what I have planned as well as new ideas. 

I want to create obstacles with a mix of short-term or long-term consequences, i.e. immediate dangers or repercussions that won't be felt for a few sessions. Here are some examples: 

1) A stray lightning bolt from the storm giant blows a hole in the food stores, ruining some of the food stored for winter. Furthermore, the conflict of the two titans ruins a couple of fields of crops. This has long-term consequences as the village will not have enough food to make it through the impending winter. The party will have to turn to other villages for help, or for plunder.  

2) The dragon's wing sends cinders flying from a large campfire in the center of the village, which catches a home on fire. This is a multi-staged obstacle that evolves as the fight continues.

- For the next three rounds after the cinders fly, the fire isn't noticeable in the chaos of combat. 

- Then, the players have to make a DC 15 perception check to see smoke rising from the house amidst the chaos. The fire will start with 20 HP and gain 5 HP a round. Using a bucket of water from a nearby fire will do 1d12 damage to the fire. 

- If the fire reaches 40 HP, the blaze from the house is more than apparent. It starts to gain 7 HP a round, and dowsing flames with the bucket still do 1d12 damage to the fire. However, anyone who approaches the fire takes 1d4 damage from the heat. 

- If the fire reaches 85 HP, the entire home is consumed in flames and cannot be saved. But, the fire spreads to two other houses (to be determined by dice roll). Each new fire starts at 20 HP and does not require a perception check to notice. 

3) The conflict draws the attention of ice mephits, which begin to harass and harry escaping villagers. 

4) If the villagers run into the nearby woods, a pack of ice wolves awaits them. 

5) A missed tail attack from the dragon wipes out all of the village's few defenders. 

6) The dragon's breath attack blows down a section of the longhouse, pinning a family under the rubble. A DC 15 athletics check can free the family. 

7) The impressive wings of the dragon pin down 10 villagers as they try to escape for 10 rounds. The villagers must make a DC 15 Strength save to escape the crushing winds, and the PCs can offer help. After 10 rounds, anyone still in the area is crushed by the combating giants.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,12,89,"So your party is finally ready to move beyond their starting area. After all, adventurers by definition travel. Usually to faraway lands seeking fame, fortune, and of course, adventure. There are lots of resources, even side adventures to be had during the travel, but what happens when you actually reach your destination? One aspect of this that can often be missed is as an interesting opportunity to add realism and possibly some fun role-playing opportunities, is how the transition from one area to another takes place in your world.

Thankfully, travel is fairly commonplace in our world today. This gives us plenty of inspiration to draw from.

Are the territories friendly with each other? If so, the crossing may not have any issue at all. A current example of this would be crossing in the EU.  Due to the signing of the Schengen Treaty, open borders is the rule rather than the exception, allowing one to travel from one country to the other often without even slowing down.

Perhaps the territories are on good terms, but still wish to maintain their own sovereignty. This is where a more traditional border checkpoint might be involved. A prime example of this would be the US Canada border. as long as you have proper identification, and not carrying anything contraband, travel between the two is relatively easy.

Is the territory you’re traveling to isolationist? This would obviously provide a much more stringent crossing process, not to mention consequences for getting in to said territory. For an example, we can look to Bhutan.  Once tourists started to come in, it wasn’t long before the monarchy fell…  but I digress…  For several years, anyone interested in coming needed to pay a hefty donation.

Perhaps the isolation isn’t due to a desire for preservation of way of life, but more due to militaristic designs?  North Korea is a great example here.  Borders are for all intent and purposed closed, heavily secured, and any interlopers are dealt with is the harshest of manners.

Is the territory land locked?  Port cities could offer an interesting crossing. No doubt trade routes use these crossings allowing for more lax interactions if it appears to be another routine transaction, with your party as crew members… or one could always try to stow away in cargo…

What about teleportation circles?  I have one into the ministry, that looks a lot like an airport terminal, complete with duty free shop right next to it, once you clear customs...

By knowing the area you are coming from, as well as the area you are traveling to, (and the relationship between the two), it becomes relatively easy to build your crossing adventure.

Let’s assume you are looking to add some kind of border crossing in your campaign. What would some of the variables at such crossing look like? Here are some considerations to include for your party as they travel. This list is by no means definitive, but should provide a good start…

·         Wait times. Are there long lines to get in? Are certain modes of transportation more popular than others? Perhaps going on foot you can get into the country much faster than one would if they were traveling as part of the caravan or on horseback.

·         Procedures. Is there a standard procedure for traveling across this border?

o   Does one need a passport / traveling papers, or even a letter of introduction to get in?   Perhaps an NPC of rank must vouch for the party, or even be willing to host their stay.  This could put the NPC at risk depending on what the party does while in country…

o   Are certain members not allowed? In my world of Komenkante, there is a country that does not allow magic users.  One must undergo a test to prove there is no magical items or presence on or in a person before they are allowed entry.  If this is the case, what is the plan to get your magic users past security?

o   Time limits. Perhaps you are only allowed to visit for certain number of days / weeks. This could provide a sense of urgency to the party for whatever reason the quest brought them there. What are the penalties for overstaying your welcome?

o   Searches and seizures. Is there anything forbidden or contraband the country does not want brought in? Perhaps there is a ban on animals like in Australia. As such your party’s familiars would not be welcome. Or it could be fruit, such as in California. Where one must declare anything they have, and possibly lose their food rations.  Any vehicles as well as the country would be subject to searches, with penalties doled out for finding contraband.

·         Border agents.  Who is securing the border? Is it a military checkpoint, where you are as likely to be attacked for approaching as let in, or is it a servant of the state keeping track of who comes and goes?    Are they corruptible? How much would it take to have the agents look the other way while the party makes its way into the area with whatever they are not supposed to have?  Are they corrupt, engaging in graft, essentially extorting newcomers who look like they can pay the “fines” levied by the agents?

·         Illegal Entry. Are there places one can find that bypass the above?   Are there NPCs to hire who know of such routes?  Possibly tunnels that have been dug, dead of night crossings, etc and make for a fun crossing as well…

Hopefully this will get you thinking about the ramifications of traveling from one major area to another in your game, and provide a few more role playing opportunities for your party.",1,Crossing Over - an examination on border crossings

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,45,1113,"In appreciation of a huge part of my childhood and to coincide with Twitch's week-long stream of the Anime, I'm going to talk about the tips and tricks you can use from Pokemon. 

1. Episodic Adventuring
--

* Set yourself up for an easier time prepping by using an episodic structure. This will allow you to have generalized ideas of your world as a whole while only focusing on one location per session. 

* It stops you from having the ""open world"" vs. ""linear story"" discussion because there isn't one with an episodic story. 
* Each episode is linked, but how they are linked can be handwaved as traveling. 
* The direction of travel isn't as important because you are essentially resetting the party's footing with each session. 

* It creates a definite end and beginning to each session. Each session begins with the party coming to a place, or experiencing something new. Each episode ends with them moving on. 

2. Build the map as you go
--

* You have your starting town and your first adventure, plus you have your list of ideas that sound cool. 
* At the end of each session you can lay out some rumors for the party to choose from. 
* When they pick one, just place that as the next spot on your ""map"". No fuss, no hassle. 
* After 9 or 10 sessions you'll have a whole region mapped out. 

3a Theme
--

* In the World of Pokemon, there is a core theme. Capture pokemon, battle them to become stronger, become the ""very best"". 
* This is a goal and an attainable one. 
* What is the core theme of your world? Boiling your world down to an idea this basic can free you up to explore ideas that are not complete in your head. 
* You don't need to know why the nations are at war if your theme boils down to: go to town, capture base, win the war. 
* Everything else can come from that and you can give your party this information as a pitch. If they're in, they're in. If not, try the next idea.

3b Location Theme
--
* Instead of focusing on the minutiae of worldbuilding, when it comes to new locations in Pokemon, each one is based around its *own* theme. 
* In Pokemon, each gym has its specialty, and from that specialty, the town grows. The rock town is rough and stoic. The ghost town is spooky and horrifying. 
* Use those random ideas you have to be the fuel to flesh out the locations of your world. 
* If we continue with the war example, you might have a list that includes: the horrors of war, the downward spiral, losing a friend, letters from home. 
* Each of those will be a location in your world: a fresh battlefield where shellshocked soldiers call for the party's help, a wasteland where the weirdness of war pull at the party's sanity, a makeshift gravesite where the party faces their fallen comrades, a base with working water/comforts and a mailbox.

4a Enemies
--

* The World Theme creates the enemies. 
* In Pokemon, it's other trainers. 
* In this War World (which I'm starting to grow fond of) it's the opposing army. 
* You don't need to know everything about them, just that they are on the opposite side of your Party. 
* They fight against the party because of the Theme. 
* They oppose the party to fulfill the theme.

4b Recurring
---
* Recurring enemies creates fondness, understanding, and something *other*. 
* Just like a player can learn about their character by experiencing various situations and reacting to them, so can we learn about the enemy by experiencing them every session. 
* And not a group of faceless nobodies. But people with faces and names. 
* In Pokemon, it's Jesse and James. 
* In this War World, it might be the seductress who is a double agent, or an opposing sniper who radios in to taunt the party. 
* It's through repeated exposure that relationships and life are brewed. 

5. Random Encounters
--

* In Pokemon, between each of gym battles, the gang has an encounter. Usually out in the woods, or on the road. 
* These are just random encounters, and random encounters done right. Each one is impactful and lends itself to the overall theme. 
* Each one involves the gaining of a pokemon, the battling of some strange trainer, the accomplishment of some bonding exercise, or the thwarting of the enemy trying to steal your power. 
* In the War World, the random encounters could be POWs, a ruined village with survivors, mortar attacks, ambushes, a strange adventure where you have to dress fancy and mingle at some benefit. 
* Create a list of 10 ideas and use that as your springboard for random encounters. 

6. Re-imagining the old
--

* Pokemon is just a homebrew DnD world where the spells are living and wizards capture them to battle and grow stronger. 
* You can create a fresh spin for *your* world just be fluffing something old (spells) as something new (pokemon). 
* What if all monsters were just people, the name in the monster manual was their nickname? 
* What if all the races were actually animals (humans are dogs, elves are cats)? 
* What if dragons are just ideas that you can be infected with?

I had some luck and found a map made but it was done in paint and wasn't very detailed. I decided I would take a higher resolution image with more landmarks on it and do my own version of the original map. I did and then sat on it for the last 5 months. Figured someone on this subreddit might get some use out of it! Cheers! [Here is the link to the image!](https://i.imgur.com/q2rCsRV.jpg)

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,42,240,"A brief aside before getting into this too far: One of the major goals of this series for me is to make the ""evil"" religions more attractive. After all, why do the cultists in *Hoard of the Dragon Queen* follow Tiamat? She's just going to eat them. It's seemed far too easy to me to oppose evil deities and cults because they're defined to be evil, and if that's the case, it seems odd to me for there to be as many followers as there seem to be in such cases. So instead I've stripped alignment away from the gods in my setting and paired them with an Ideal. Any time a mortal acts in line with that Ideal, that energy will give power to the deity in question regardless of whether or not they worship that deity. So if you act with Honor, you lend power to Bahamut. If you act with Ambition, you give power to Tiamat. And here, if you act with hatred (regardless of what that hate is for), you lend power to Asmodeus.

***“People fear the Lord of the Nine because they do not understand Him. He is not some powerful force of Evil that seeks to impose his will on mortals like you and I; that would be too simple. He is a being of Hatred, and his Power comes from the hatred that we mortals experience. Whenever you act on your anger and hate, you lend Him power. Yet, this is not a bad thing; there are many abhorrent things in the world that deserve the focus of our hatred.”- Tristan Sagona, High Beacon***

# Divine Names

Because he is so often feared, Asmodeus is rarely referred to by this name by the common folk. Instead, they will refer to him as The Odious King or The Hateful One. Those that are also familiar with the structure of the Nine Hells of Baator will also refer to Asmodeus as Lord of the Nine.

# Domains

Like all of the other Prime Deities, Asmodeus is associated with a particular Ideal that he manifests. His opponents speak of him as a furious tyrant, but his Ideal is actually that of Hatred and is often more of a scalpel than a bludgeon. Within this Ideal are several smaller domains that fall under the control of Asmodeus:

**Hatred**.The primary domain of Asmodeus is that of Hatred. While this often is associated with a malicious intent, this domain also includes less extreme forms; things like hating the weather or an idea fall into this domain and contribute power to Asmodeus.

**Anger**.Because of its similarities to Hate, the domain of Anger also falls under Asmodeus’ power. Because of this, many Barbarians or those that channel their anger to accomplish things are a bit more likely to at least venerate Asmodeus if they don’t outright worship him.

**Leadership**.The last domain under Asmodeus’ power is that of leadership and allowing hate to spark action. Many people are not driven to action without some bit of hatred involved, even if there are other factors included in their motivation. But whenever anger and hate lead a person to act, it contributes to the Ideal of Hatred and the power of Asmodeus.

# Dogma

At its core, the dogma followed by Asmodeus’ more ardent supporters likely feels more intense than the dogma of other deities, but these supporters work to avoid being blinded by their hatred. Although there are  some deep divisions within the sects of this faith, the core dogma is as follows:

**Hate should be embraced**.When someone feels a seed of hatred, they should not try to avoid it. Embracing the emotion and allowing oneself the room to evaluate the merits of the hate help them learn coping mechanisms so they do not become overwhelmed by their Passions.

**Wrath is righteous.**Although persistent and blind rage can cause widespread Destruction, the core of anger can spur action to solve problems. Anger should be wielded with care, but it should be wielded.

# Tenets

The clergy of Asmodeus are diverse in their practices, but there are a few common tenets they share and preach to their communities.

**Anger with Action.**Anger should not be allowed to sit and fester. Instead, use anger to motivate progress and reach your goals.

**To Live is to Lead**.Action is important, but guiding anger and action to reach a larger goal requires leadership. When someone finds something abhorrent, they should step up to lead those around them against whatever terrible thing they hate.

**Temper your Hate**.While Asmodeus doesn’t specifically advocate this perspective, many of his mortal followers do. It is important to make sure hatred does not overwhelm a person, and this can be done by tempering the emotion so that it is kept in check. Like a hearth, hate can provide warmth and safety, but if left unchecked it can burn down them home.

&amp;#x200B;

# Allies of the Faith

Despite the stigma of the Nine Hells and the devils that live there, the Church of Asmodeus do have some allies and align well with a few other Ideals and their Gods.

## Church of Domination

Because of Hatred’s call to lead, its followers often feel kinship with those that worship Gruumsh and the Ideal of Domination. However, this closeness tends to only be one way, with followers of Gruumsh feeling closer to followers of Asmodeus than the other way around.

## Church of Passion

The Ideal of Passion and its patron, Sehanine, often work well with that of Hatred, especially when it involves a call to action. While the Church of Passion is more ardent than any other religious group, many that worship Hatred also worship Passion, and lean heavily into the zeal and combine that with the hate they kindle.

## [Church of Honor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/a8fg5g/honor_bahamut/)

Bahamut and Honor are can work surprisingly well with Hatred at times, although this alliance is tenuous and generally falls along sectarian lines in both religions. Those that hold both faiths closely will often channel their hate to root out those that would be dishonorable.

&amp;#x200B;

# Enemies of the Faith

Asmodeus and Hatred do have many enemies throughout the cosmos due to the tendencies of mortals that act on their Hatred to cause much larger problems.

## Church of Harmony

Erathis, the Lord of Harmony, seeks to maintain peace between all people, nations, and worlds. As such, acting on Hatred is something this church of vehemently opposed to.

## Church of Endurance

Those that follow the Kord and the Ideal of Endurance aren’t hostile toward the followers of Hatred, but there is definitely no love lost between these faiths. Where Asmodeus preaches for action, Kord preaches to endure, and this opposition in values is difficult to bridge.

## [Church of Desolation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9p8qbi/desolation_the_raven_queen/)

Another faith that often conflicts with Asmodeus is the Raven Queen and Desolation. The Raven Queen’s followers preach that emptying oneself of emotions is the path to wisdom, which has no space within the Ideal of Hatred or the Church of Asmodeus.

&amp;#x200B;

# Clergy &amp; Temples

Like the devils in the Nine Hells, the Church of Asmodeus has a very strict hierarchy based on experience and capability. Formally, there are only three categories for the dedicated clergy, but newer and less experienced members within a group are expected to defer to those that are older and more experienced.

**Torches**:Acolytes that have the least experience are called Torches to represent the hate they have begun to kindle. Common responsibilities for Torches include hosting faith workshops to help people learn to channel their emotions in constructive ways. A common sentiment expressed in these groups is “*It is good to allow yourself to feel anger and hatred so you can learn how to deal with it in a productive way.*”

**Firesworn**:Those that learn to process their hate and anger in healthy ways are eventually promoted to the rank of Firesworn. These clergy members swear an oath to guide others to action and provide counsel to people with more extreme and difficult-to-control anger and hate issues.

**High Beacon**:People that reach this level are those that have mastered control of the hate they experience. They operate the highest levels of the temples and churches and are often the guiding leader for an entire geographic region.

## Temple Designs

Temples dedicated to Asmodeus often have large open interiors where people have room to pace and roam if they get jittery as they learn to process the emotions that are encouraged here. The temples are often lit with open flames from torches, sconces, and brazers.

## Common Symbols &amp; Icons

The most iconic symbol used in temples to Asmodeus depict a simplified image of a humanoid figure rising out of a pit of flames. Clergy can explain that this symbol represents how if you allow yourself to exist within the emotions society labels as “negative” or “bad” that you can learn to find clarity and rise above them. Beyond this particular symbol, simplified symbols of a flame surrounded by twisted horns, or the circular symbol for the Nine Hells are often used to identify centers of worship for Asmodeus.Fire is a common symbol used in places throughout the religion because of how easily it represents so many aspects of hate; one of the more common (if also a bit pithy) understandings of the core tenets is “*Hate is like a hearth. It can warm your home, but can also burn it down if left unchecked*.” Similarly, color schemes around this faith include dark reds and golds, along with any other fiery colors, but lean toward deeper, darker hues than brighter and more vibrant tones.

&amp;#x200B;

# Holy Days &amp; Festivals

Followers of The Odious King aren’t generally a celebratory type, and as such they tend to have few days of celebration. Most festivals are celebrated as part of other local celebrations for local leadership, however, they do have one official holy day.

## Night of Fire

The only official Holy Day is the Night of Fire. Generally this is celebrated on the last day of summer or the first day of fall, when the danger of wildfires is the highest. Celebrations involve building a large bonfire after clearing a large area and keeping it burning all night. These rituals are overseen by a Firesworn or High Beacon so the fire doesn’t get out of hand. The night includes time that is dedicated to meditation, and sermons on kindling hatred so it is useful, but maintaining control so it doesn’t destroy everything nearby.

&amp;#x200B;

# Avatars &amp; Champions

Asmodeus most often uses his avatar form when meeting with the other archevils in the Nine Hells, but he occasionally uses the appearance when meeting with mortal champions that worthy of his counsel. On occasion, he sends Xargrag, his Champion on quests to deliver messages to various groups.

## Avatar of Asmodeus

Asmodeus’ avatar manifests as an human man that appears to be in his 60s or 70s, except that he has a pair of sleek sweeping horns that curl back around his head. His eyes glow with a fiery golden color, his hair has a definite ashy tone, and his paler skin has distinct creases and wrinkles. He stands straight and always appears to be slightly taller than the next tallest person in the vicinity.He always manifests in pale gray robes with golden trim, and frequently summons an ornate chair to sit on while he conducts whatever business is necessary.

## Champion: Xargrag

A monstrous pit fiend, Xargrag is the only creature in all of the Nine Hells that doesn't hate Asmodeus. Instead, the hatred he has mastered is directed outward at any that would dare attempt to usurp the Lord of the Nine. He wears an intricate set of scale armor constructed from bone fragments of those he has personally slain, and he frequently offers to add the bones of someone tries to get in his way.

# Known Sects &amp; Cults

Although there are some individuals whose behaviors can be more zealous than most people like, the benefits offered by the more mainstream denominations keep this faith popular enough to a powerful social force.

## Sect: Order of the Adamantine Scepter

Often welcomed in major cities and larger towns, the Order of the Adamantine Scepter is the largest and most mainstream denomination within the followers of Asmodeus. This group makes an effort to stay socially acceptable, and works to assuage fears of what their hate will lead to with assurances like *“I worship hate, not destruction”* and other similar platitudes. And by and large, this is true. This sect often works adamantly to teach others how to control their emotions and focus them towards achieving whatever goals they have.

**Optional Rule: Odious Mastery** Firesworn and High Beacons in this group have mastered their hatred and emotions to the point that even magical means of manipulation are difficult. Firesworn that are members of this sect cannot be affected by magic that would charm, dominate, or frighten them unless the spell is cast using a spell slot of sixth level or higher. Likewise, High Beacons cannot be affected by these spells unless they are cast using a ninth level spell slot.

## Sect: Brotherhood of Iron Flames

This small, secretive, and insular sect of Asmodeus is made of the most traditionally evil followers of Asmodeus. They ride the line between control their mastery of the Ideal.  Many of these priests tend toward  utilitarian and ends-justify-the-means philosophies, and use the hatred they foster as motivation to accomplish whatever goals they work toward. While this group is less likely to be openly welcomed in large cities, they do make excellent military leaders, and can often find themselves encouraged to fulfill such roles.

**Optional Rule: Cleansed by Fire.** Priests of this sect are inclined to the more violent aspect of anger and hatred. A Firesworn or High Beacon can use this to manifest their power and create a radius of holy fire around them. Any creature within this radius that the priest is hostile, regardless of ally or enemy status, takes 1d4 fire damage on the priest’s turn, and this damage bypasses resistance or immunity to fire damage. For a Firesworn, the radius of this effect is 15ft, and for a High Beacon, the radius is 30ft.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

## Additional Notes:

1. Gods as Ideals: The idea for this started as I was reading *Oathbringer* by Brandon Sanderson. My players didn’t really like the idea of alignments in our game, and I’d been looking for a solution to remove the alignments from the deities for my custom setting. In many of Sanderson’s novels, gods are Ideals; people worship Honor or Cultivation, and they fear Odium and Ruin. So I adapted this for my setting. Each God is the manifestation of a particular Ideal, and the Outer Planes were created around them as a place where that Ideal manifests in purity. This has resulted in my players being more interested and sympathetic to all of the religions in my game. Tiamat is a lot more interesting when she’s just the ideal of Ambition, because that’s not always a bad thing, and Bahamut is not always the best because sometimes Honor gets in the way.
2. The Optional Rules listed in the Sects section are intended for NPCs and not for PCs, and are meant to help provide more thematic abilities than tropes like “cleric of the goddess of death casts *inflict wounds*.” However, if you need a blessing from the deity for a player, these might also be cool solutions for that!",1,Hatred: Asmodeus
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,103,483,"DM: “Alright everyone, roll for Initiative”

It’s a phrase so synonymous with Dungeons &amp; Dragons that it can be easily referenced in everyday situations and memes. It's the subtitle of r/DnD and it even has an Ubran Dictionary page. It tells the players that combat is beginning and it’s often an incredibly exciting moment. Those words are often the start of something epic, and they’re a vital tool in the DM’s arsenal. However, today I would like to play devil’s advocate and argue AGAINST its usage, in an attempt to broaden the options players have and make routine scenarios feels tense.

Imagine your players are level 3 and they’re traveling through an unexplored forest. They enter a clearing and come across 3 men and an Owlbear. 

*The Owlbear is licking a wound on its front right leg while the three large men rummage through a bag of holding. They look up at you with anticipation*. *Roll for Initiative!* 

Players will likely flip to their spell sheet, sit higher in their seat and start rolling their D20s. Combat has begun. In combat, players can perceive the encounter through a few different lenses, but the most common in my experience with players new and old is to maximize Damage Dealt, while minimizing Damage Received. This is what’s known as a First Order Optimal Strategy or FOO Strategy, and this heavily motivates how players take their turns. A set initiative turn order means the first player has an important decision: do they take their action to deal as much damage as possible before the enemies can strike back? Or do they risk wasting their turn? I don’t want to summarize all players as the reaction to this scenario varies incredibly wildly based on the players and the characters they’re playing. But the questions running through the player’s mind are about reacting to a combat scenario.

Now let’s consider this same scenario, but this time:

*The Owlbear is licking a wound on its front right leg while the three large men rummage through a bag of holding. They look up at you with anticipation*. *What do you do next?*

For my players, this frames the encounter in an entirely different light: who are these people? Is the Owlbear their pet? Who or what injured it? What should I do - what would my character do? These are all great questions to have, and it allows the players to interpret the scenario however they wish, and now the scene is filled with **TENSION**. This *could* become a combat scenario, or it could be potential allies and it’s completely up to the players. As a DM you can react accordingly either way and learn valuable information about how your party will behave in the future. Perhaps the players immediately attack and you decide these were important druids in the story. 

In the first example, the players were given a lot of connotations that are intrinsically associated with rolling for initiative. To turn a phrase, the players were given a hammer and when you have a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. In this case, by telling the players “This scenario is combat”, the characters involved start looking very different. Perhaps your players will take their turn as an opportunity to question the characters and that’s great role-playing, but not necessarily the first instinct. As Lead Designer of Magic the Gathering, Mark Rosewater said “*What I've learned over the years is that you shouldn't change your players to match your game; you should change your game to match your players. Don't get yourself into a fight you're probably not going to win*.” If you don’t want your interesting NPCs and combat encounters to feel like pounding nails, then don’t give your players a hammer. 

**TL;DR:**

Starting scenarios with an initiative roll tells your players “this is combat” and limits the breadth of options they will consider when approaching each scenario. Try using the prompt “What do you do?”.",1,Roll for Initiative! How to Begin Interesting Scenarios
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,10,71,"#The Family of Night
---------------------------
##What is the Family of Night?

The Family of Night is an encounter I designed for my group's first visit into the setting's largest city, Aldwych. It combines elements from The Godfather, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Red Dead Redemption, Daredevil, and a few other sources to create a family of vampires that not only survive, but thrive using the wicked underbelly of a corrupt city. These vampires can be used as antagonists, allies, frenemies, and/or background fluff of any urban campaign but they should **never** be punching bags. The idea is to blur the lines of good and evil.

---------------

**Hooks:**

-Your party might hear about an eccentric family of philanthropists, The Brontes, through someone in the upper crust of society like a noble or wealthy merchant.

-A thief, drug dealer, or fence might share whispers with the party about having to pay respects (and tithe) to The Family of Night, an elusive criminal organization 

-The city watch could enlist the party's help figuring out a missing persons case. Addicts have suddenly been disappearing off the street.

-----

Regardless, your party is eventually going to be acquainted with the family:

**Sigmund, The Information Broker** 

*""I will not lose another family.""*

When Sigmund was a childhood, his father was passed over in inheritance fostering a seething resentment. Sigmund's father was approached by a devil offering great power. Through dark ritual, Sigmund and his family were transformed into creatures of the night, vampires. Using this power, Sigmund and his family ruled for generations sometimes overtly, but more often from the shadows. Sigmund learned his cleverness from his father's careful manipulation. A mere few decades ago, Sigmund's family was exposed and a band of vampire hunters slayed them all, or so they thought. Sigmund managed to escape and fled to far away Aldwych where he established himself as a banker, slowly working his way into the pockets of city elite and donating extravagent amounts to charitable causes. Now, Sigmund is one of the city's biggest earners, a title he keeps by trading secrets and making lucrative loans.

**Godiva, The Temptress** 

*""A guiding hand is necessary to maintain order.""*

Not long after Sigmund's arrival in Aldwych, his charitable efforts acquainted him with a widow named Godiva. Her husband was killed in a mugging by one of the city's most vicious gangs, the Tomriin (Orcish for Iron-Bloods). Sigmund, having grown lonely after the death of his family, offered Godiva immense power to seek revenge on her late husband's behalf. Naturally, Godiva accepted. By the time the players arrive, the Tomriin is a feeble shadow of its former self. Godiva is the owner of several taverns and brothels across Aldwych as a way to create revenue, and aid Sigmund's information collection

**Blake, The Enforcer** 

*""The people of this city are sheep. I'd rather be a wolf.""*

Blake never had anything. She was a street rat, starving, going days without a meal. Her thievery days ended after Godiva's supernatural awareness caught Blake in the act. After finding the girl was dirty, emaciated, and bruised, she was immediately brought into Sigmund's estate to be nursed back to health. After a few days, Blake planned to leave in the night, stealing a sack of food from the Bronte cellar. What Blake in the cellar, however, was Sigmund and Godiva devouring an Orcish thug. After Blake found what her caretakers really were, she pleaded to be granted the curse, to do more than steal and die on the cobbles of Aldwych. Although initially apprehensive, Sigmund turned Blake. Since her conversion, Blake has served as the family's protector, finding those who would expose their secret and 'convincing' them otherwise. With her knowledge of the criminal underworld, Blake has also been the primary force behind driving competition out of Aldwych and setting up their own operations.

**Veren, The Alchemist** 

*""Oh! Hello there, my name's Veren! It's nice to meet you!""*

The most recent addition to the family, Veren was an incredibly promising student at Mordenkainen's Magical University, specializing in creating alchemical formulas. After a foray into occult research gone wrong, Veren accidentally turned himself into a vampiric fledgeling. In his intense hunger, Veren killed one of his classmates participating in the blood ritual. Veren was expelled and faced the chopping block, but Sigmund intervened. Through a combination of his connections at the university, the city watch, and a generous donation to the classmate's family, the charges were dropped and Veren was brought into the fold of the family. Blake convinced Veren to begin producing addictive narcotics that she helped distribute throughout rival neighborhoods. The most hopeless of addicts are taken off the street and consumed by the family.


-------------


#The Good

The Bronte family does an enormous amount of good for the city. Their donations helped fund an entire wing of the university. Capital circulated by Sigmund's bank helps to keep the city afloat. Violent and brutal gang warfare is, for the most part, a thing of the past having been replaced by simple monthly tithes and the occasional disappearance of those who refuse to follow the family's rules of civility. 

#The Bad

The family's money keeps City Council corrupt and their drugs are an anathema to the city's poorer districts. The Bronte's tithe collection drives businesses off the market with even more frequency than Sigmund's exorbitant rates. 

#The Ugly

At the end of the day, the Family of Night is a vampire cult. They abduct people and drain their blood and eat their flesh. Can anyone abide by that, even *if* it's for the greater good? Removing the Brontes from power will create an enormous power vacuum in the city and lurch it closer to financial depression. Is that the price to pay to pull the people of Aldwych out from under their thumbs, or is it better to leave well enough alone. 

------------------

##If the party sides against The Family of Night: 

Use the stats for Vampire Neonate for Godiva and Veren, the stats for Vampire Warrior for Blake, and the stats for Vampire for Sigmund. Engaging all four of them in combat is a precarious move and will usually result in the party being ground into a fine paste and slurped through a straw.

 Alternatively, the party may wish to bring down The Brontes legally finding evidence of their wrongdoing (vampiric or criminal) throughout the city and exposing them in court. Be warned though, the family is not likely to take kindly to someone looking to drag their name through the mud, but if the party succeeds, the Brontes will probably submit to imprisonment or flee rather than reveal the curse. After all, their connections run deep and blood can be found in even the deepest of prisons. Should the Brontes ever be freed, rest assured they will be out for revenge.

##If the party sides with The Family of Night:

They'll have gained a very powerful ally within Aldwych. Helping to persuade shop owners into paying their tithe, tinkering with new strains of narcotics, and stopping muckrakers who would bully an honest family just trying to get by. It's unlikely anyone in the family would consider a party member their equal (except perhaps Veren), but if the party proves themselves reliable, benefits come in spades, least of which is generous financial compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

A recent writing challenge I set myself as a means to explore the monsters of D&amp;D turned into a slow-burning obsession of mine for the last few weeks and I thought I might share my completed work with others so it might get more use than it will in my game. I wanted to write an adventure hook for each monster type released by WotC. I decided on three per creature and NPC as a good amount, providing enough diversity in adventure hooks, NPC bases and world-building features to hopefully inspire any fellow DMs trying to populate a world. There are a few complications I have thrown in as well to some hooks where I identified different directions to take the plot.

I've begun with Volo's Guide due to it containing some of the most esoteric monsters that might otherwise never have seen the light of day behind their more orthodox kin in the Monster Manual. I figured this would not take long due to the book holding the smallest stable of creatures but I didn't count on the large number of creature subtypes (20+ different ways to use Gnolls became quite draining). I skipped the dinosaurs, though may return to update them when I receive a bout of inspiration. I have now begun on the Monster Manual and if this post is well received I will try to have it up on here soon.

I've included a link to the full list here and a few examples of what to expect. Feel free to steal and adapt to your heart's content, you know better than anyone what is good for your game.

Cranium Rat Swarm

* A swarm of cranium rats has infested an army camp, following the soldiers into battle and finding wounded on the battlefield and other easy targets for its mindflayer masters to steal away. They are using their mind reading abilities to learn what they can from the army command.
* A wizard has begun collecting scores of cranium rats using them as lights in his lair and their divination blocking abilities to shroud his work in secrecy. The rats hang suspended in cages across the laboratory luminating it in an eldritch blue light. - Complication; the close proximity of the rats and their growing number is allowing them to form a hive mind once more, they are waiting for their time to strike the wizard, watching his work and delving into his mind.
* The people of the under city are being plagued by a monstrous creature that approaches in the dark, heralded by flashes of light whispering their darkest thoughts to them, then steals away the unwary. The rumours are varied and wild but few suspect it’s a swarm of cranium rats dominating stragglers and leading them deeper to the elder brain's subterranean lair.

&amp;#x200B;

Devourer

* The party encounter a once thriving village now desolated, not a single body in sight and signs of conflict everywhere. A tearful survivor tells of a hideous beast that consumed the townspeople transforming them into its own undead slaves which rounded up the remaining survivors driving them to its gullet. This army is headed to the next nearest town.
* A nervous/arrogant (your preference) Necromancer seeks out the party explaining that its undead minions have abandoned her control, every new one she constructs following the same path to the Devourer on the material plane. She asks the party's help in defeating the monster so she can once more utilise her magic.
* A priest of Orcus and marauding pirate uses a devourer as a bound first mate and ship mast to strike fear on the high seas, using its power to transform its defeated enemies into its unwilling slaves, slowly building a fleet of the undead in Orcus' name.


Flail Snail

* An exotic blacksmith has come to these lands following rumours of great armoured beasts. She employs the party to track and hunt such creatures and bring her as many shells as they can. Complication: the blacksmith has hidden the true worth of the shells from the party and intends to make away with the goods at a cutthroat price.
* A nomadic tribe always come to market bringing the finest of glassware to sell. Their work has attracted admiration from all and curiosity over how they create such works with no established foundry. The tribe follow the glassy trails of the flail snail and are fiercely protective of the animals whom their culture is built around. Complication: the party encounter and fight the snail, when it's defeated and begins wailing in its shell a squad of tribe warriors arrive ready to fight.
* A mineral mine has been invaded by a flail snail, which is devouring all the precious stones inside creating tumbles of dazzling beauty in its glassy wake.

&amp;#x200B;

Stone Giant Dreamwalker

* A dream walker wanders through a town plucking random items from the townspeople's shops, homes and even hands, with an absent minded expression it attaches them to himself and wanders on. - Complication; one item is an ancient family heirloom and its ancestral owner is demanding its return.
* A stone giant clan requires the guidance of an elder who long ago left them to seek inspiration in the world above. They have no idea how the surface world works so seek the party's aid in finding their lost kin.
* A stone giant has gone mad seeking new art on the surface world, it has found the lair of a basilisk pack/medusa and is using the petrified creatures they create to create tableaus of beauty and horror.

&amp;#x200B;

Annis Hag

* Granny Weatherwax is a name rightly feared through the entire plain. Ogres and trolls scream her name in battle as they raid the parishes, and any captured die before they sell out their dear devoted Granny, either by their own hand or one of granny's collars if they begin to tell tall tales. No one has seen the infamous granny of the wilds but all fear her and whisper rumours of her nature, for what creature could command such devotion from such powerful brutes.
* A hunt for a poltergeist plaguing a family takes a darker turn when the party discovers the horrific mutilation of animals and destruction is being wrought by the family's own daughter. When questioned all she will say is that Big Sister said it was okay, the cat had kittens in it, there was no need to wait to get them out.
* On a remote hilltop, a creaking mansion holds Matron Grimtooth and her devoted children, Grimtooth's Adoption House. Several recent serial killers have all been traced as former members of the orphanage and the local government is becoming suspicious of what is happening inside - complication; the Guard tasked with helping the party investigate the manor house is another graduate of GAH and will do anything to protect his beloved Matron.

&amp;#x200B;

Quickling

* A quickling is found injured in the path of the adventurers. It bears an important missive for a Fae noble and begs the party take it or the letter with all haste. Lives depend upon it.
* The party unwittingly attract the ire of a quickling when they take a rare fruit from a Fae grove. The quickling has been tasked with recovering the fruit and doggedly pursues the party striking unseen with its speed to reclaim the prize. - Complication; the quickling doesn't know who has it so steals all their stuff triggering a dramatic chase.
* A group of quicklings are placing bets upon a race between animals of the forest seeing which deserves their veneration. An insomniac hare and a determined tortoise are the current contenders.

&amp;#x200B;

Slithering Tracker

* A beloved young woman was slain the night before her wedding day, suspicion fell on her fiancee but he died the next night. Now anyone connected to the couple are ending the same way. A scorned lover of the woman has turned himself to a slithering tracker to claim his revenge.
* A hag offers wronged mortals the power to take their vengeance through the ritual of the slithering tracker. Once they have killed the target of their rage she entraps them in a glass bottle. When she needs someone killed she whispers dark lies to the trapped trackers convincing them her target was the one responsible until their rage drives them to kill them. She has collected quite a pantry of dangerous assassin's.
* An NPC rival of the party who they wronged in some way previously becomes a tracker aiming to ambush the guilty party.- complication; the tracker was misled into its rage,  The party can either slay the beast or attempt the cure the beast of its affliction before the madness of its form takes control.

&amp;#x200B;

Spawn of Kyuss

* A temple attempts to resurrect a heroic figure lost fighting an undead menace but is incapable of finding their soul. They beseech the party to find whatever creatures holds their hero's soul in place and free it. The hero has become a spawn of kythus and until destroyed will remain a soul trapped within it. - complication; even after resurrection the souls time within the beast has driven the hero slightly mad, this could play out in the party needing to take on a greater role in their stead or the heroe working at some mad scheme for/against Orcus.
* A zombie horde sweeps the lands it's numbers bolstered by sporadically placed spawns of kythus amongst them, overly brash fighters find themselves quickly overwhelmed.
* Whilst on a sea journey a single kythus worm resides aboard and is determined to find a host.


Blackguard

* A pirate captain once served as a loyal right hand to the good king but fell to the corruption of greed seeing the wealth of his king and the poverty of his kin. One act of thievery became another and then another until the goodwill behind the crimes disappeared into the rush of the crime. Now he rides the waves hunting for the next score.
* A Paladin of the Ancients was beholden to guard the hidden ways of the forest but they trusted a long term friend in a time of need and guided them through a shortcut. This friend  betrayed them and cost the sanctity of the forest through their crimes causing the death of fae and the destruction of sacred land. Their power was stripped from them for this betrayal and their heart turned dark leading to them killing anyone they saw as responsible for the tragedy never accepting their own role in the destruction of the forest.
* A vengeance paladin followed their quest of honourable vengeance to the blackest parts of the underdark in chase of the drow responsible for kidnapping their entire village. The darkness and death they found in those maddening tunnels broke them. The sight of humans and elves strung up treated as less than animals snapped something in that stressed mind and they went on a frenzy against the Drow slavers. Their code of vengeance tempered by mercy was replaced by the desire to kill and satisfy their blood lust.

&amp;#x200B;

Warlock of the Archey

* Each of the queens of the seelie and unseelie court nominates one warlock who is their mortal emissary to the material plane. When the Queens wish to address leaders of material plane factions their emissary are their mouthpiece, there to present the goals and feelings of the queens themselves.
* One of the unseelie nobles delights in corrupting mortals to be her servants through promises of growing power but such contracts corrupt their morals into darker being than they were before. People who delight in the cruelty their winter lady requires.
* A warlock of the Seelie queen travels the wilds speaking for the fae in mortal affairs. When a logging company comes near to a sacred grove protected by dryads or a Korred faces off against miners this warlock intervenes attempting to find a peaceful resolution for all involved.",1,Volo's guide to Monster's - Adventure Hooks

Few things make me brace for impact like when a DM starts a game by saying, “I’m sorry.”

I’ve done it too. That’s how I know it sets the DM up for failure on both ends of the table.

It’s not about letting the players know you’re underprepared that’s bad. That’s fine. That can help pad some rough edges and let them know to steer the game a bit more than usual or to offer some extra leeway.

The problem is that “I’m sorry” usually means the DM has lost faith in their ability to DM.

Being new, trying something different, or not having everything prepared are things we all face. Despite that, we can still have fun and perform as a DM. If the DM doesn’t believe in their ability or their material, they’re not going to do one of the most important things the DM must do: Lead the fun.

If they’re not having fun, there’s a decent chance the players aren’t having fun. If they’re concerned about something other than the game (in whatever capacity that means for your table), then the game will likely suffer.

I think “I’m sorry” should only be uttered in this context AFTER the game. Before the game, I say open-ended and more jovial terms. Things like “I’m going to try something different. If it blows up in my face, I might not do it again. Or will at least tweak it.” Stuff like that.

I don’t know. I may just be talking out of my sickly, tired ass. What are your thoughts?",1,"The DM Should Never Start a Game With ""I'm sorry..."" (or so I think)"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,76,274,"#Overview
I realize that the D&amp;D rules aren't exactly supposed to act like a Real Life Simulator™, but after reading through the Player's Guide for all swimming-related rules, I noticed that there were some seriously strange interactions (not to mention glaring omissions) that didn't make any logistical sense. So, I set out to create a set of more realistic swimming rules that take into account factors such as physical exertion and encumbrance. Any and all critiques/suggestions are welcome. 


By RAW (regardless of armor worn or weight of gear):

* Human CON 0 modifier can hold breath for 1 minute and swim 300 feet underwater. 
* Human CON 3 modifier can hold breath for 4 minutes and swim 1,200 feet underwater. 


I get that PCs are all supposed to be exceptional adventurers, but to keep things in context, here are some Guinness Book of World Records:

* Longest distance underwater – 580ft; 3 mins, 5 seconds
* Longest breath held at rest – 11 mins, 35 seconds
* Longest distance over water – 139.8 miles; 50 hours, 10 minutes


With the homebrew rules below, the above RAW distances are halved (but can be swam in half the time, if desired, with the dash action), assuming that the character is not wearing armor or carrying anything heavy. 


#Holding breath
**Note**: If the creature can breathe underwater, ignore this section.

* Each Action, Reaction, and Bonus Action underwater costs 1 round (6 seconds) of breath.
* Creatures can hold breath for a number of minutes equal to 1+CON mod (minimum 30 seconds), before they begin suffocating.
* Creatures suffocate for number of rounds equal to CON mod (minimum 1 round); at start of the following turn, it drops to 0 hp. It can’t regain HP or stabilize until breathing again.
* Qualifiers:
    * Creatures that spend 10 consecutive turns breathing deeply before they hold their breath can add 1 minute to their max held breath time.
    * Creatures that do not take an action or use move speed with their turn gain one bonus turn of hold breath time (which itself cannot gain more bonus turns).

#Movement
* Creatures sink at a per-round-rate of 5ft per 1/10th of maximum carry capacity (which is STR score x 15lbs) 
* Creatures without a swim speed treat swimming like difficult terrain; each foot swam costs one additional foot of movement.
* Creatures without a swim speed must succeed a DC 10 CON saving throw after each hour of swimming or gain one level of exhaustion.
* Creatures without a swim speed swimming at a depth greater than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purposes of determining exhaustion; deeper than 200 feet counts as 4 hours.

#Actions
* Attacks:
    * Melee: at disadvantage, unless weapon deals piercing damage type (excepting morningstars or war picks)
    * Ranged: range reduced to ¼ of value on land
* Spellcasting: 
    * If the creature can’t breathe underwater:
        * Can attempt to cast a number of spells with verbal components equal to 1+CON mod (minimum 1)
        * Casting spells with verbal components requires a CON save DC 8+spell level:
            * If success: cast spell as normal
            * If fails: spell fails to cast (and does not cost a spell slot)
    * Spells may or may not work in water environment. Be reasonable. Fireball isn’t going to have oxygen to burn underwater; Tidal Wave isn’t going to really hurt if you’re under water, though it would certainly displace creatures. Use your best judgment here and feel free to discuss with DM.
* Doffing: 

Item | Donning | Doffing
|:-|:-|:- 
Light armor | 10 turns | 10 turns
Medium armor | 50 turns | 10 turns
Heavy armor | 100 turns | 50 turns
Shield | 1 action | 1 action
Backpack | 1 action | 1 action

* Qualifiers: 
    * Each creature that assists in donning or doffing can reduce time by ½.
    * If using a slashing weapon, armor can be cut off with a DC 15 DEX check to reduce doffing time to ¼.

Again, please feel free to make suggestions for how to improve/simplify these rules.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,19,"Creation takes effort and work. In order to make something function, it takes the delicate touch of an intelligent being. But when many are required, new methods must be done to ensure mass production. That's why Galasrimip was created.  
  
***  
  
**Name:** Galasrimip (pronounced ga-LASS-rim-ip)   
  
**Titles:** The Mirror, Grand Mimic, Father/Mother of Reflections, The Formless God

**Holy Symbol:** Mirror  
  
**Alignment:** True Neutral

**Portfolio:** Mass production, copying, Replication, twins, asexual reproduction, reflections, transformations, multiplication, and unoriginality  
   
**Domains:** All  
  
**Allies:** Azuth, Hoar, Lathander, Mystra, Silvanus, Most Demon Princes and Princesses  
  
**Enemies:** Ao, Asmodeus, Bane, Gond, Helm, Mrykul, Oghma, Waukeen   
  
**Favored Weapon:** Longsword  
  
***  
  
**Appearance:**  
  
Galasrimip's base form is a horrific display that many would assume to be a great old one. It appears differently based on the environment it is encountered in.  
In a desert, it may appear as giant scorpion made of sand with lizard feet at the end of it's legs, a cactus instead of a stinger, and claws composed of brambles.  
When encountered in a city, it will take the appearance of a somewhat humanoid giant made of stone but with body parts of the local city's races strung about it's body. Speaking in a mumbled tone about indecipherable nonsense.  
Galasrimip in the mountains may be a giant mass of snow with teeth made of ice, arms of tree logs, and a giant boot for a head.  
  
When Galasrimip finds another living or undead being, it will often take the form of it instead. Speaking exactly in the same tone as them while maintaining it's mysterious personality.   
  
***  
  
**Backstories:**  
  
According to the various faiths of Galasrimip, it is one of the younger gods. When the other gods were assigned to populate the universe with their portfolios, they found it exhausting to make their items. So Ao had to create a new god that would give them the power to multiply their portfolios.  
  
When Galasrimip was first created, it was horrific to all the other gods. They all assumed that Ao had accidentally let in one of the great old ones, be he assured that this would be the newest addition to the pantheon. It dragged it's way over to Selune, the first goddess and lifted itself towards her face. With it's many eyes, it examined her from head to toe before retreating into itself.  
  
With a massive flash of light, it transformed into an exact copy of the goddess of moons and stars. In her voice it said ""allow us to help."" With it's arms outstretched, it copied the few stars she had made and populated the whole cosmos with it.  
  
It transformed into each of the other gods as well, assisting them in mass creating their items of choice.  
  
When it was done copying all of the gods, Ao thought that Galasrimip's job was done. The universe had all it needed. If anything new needed to be created, the other gods could do it by hand. So with a flick of his wrist, he dismissed the god of copies.  
  
That was until Ao saw himself standing before him. The copy of Ao spoke ""We can be anyone, anything, any form. So long as other things exist, we will take their form. And we shall exist in this universe so long as you are in it."" And with a final smile, the mirror turned back into it's eldritch form and slithered away.  
  
Why Galasrimip was able to be of equal strength to Ao is unknown. Most believe it to be part of it's nature, to exist so long as others do. A heretical belief is that Galasrimip is actually a great old one given the power and sentience of a god. No one is actually sure where The Grand Mimic gets it's powers.    
  
***  
  
**Dogma, clergy, and temples:**  
  
It is said that every temple can be a shrine to Galasrimip if one believes it to be so. As the god with the ability to take the form of anything, it can be assumed that literally anything could be a manifestation of the god.  
  
But there are almost no dedicated churches to the god of reflections. There are very few who worship Galasrimip alone, as it is a monstrosity without anything to copy off of. To worship Galasrimip is to enhance the ability of the other god being worshiped by becoming a copy of them for a short time.  
As such, most other churches pay homage to the Father of Reflections by placing a mirror next to the holy symbol of the other god.  
  
Usually when Galasrimip's name is invoked with another diety, it is asking for a multiplied version of their power. Someone asking for Chauntea and Galasrimip's help will want Chauntea to allow a good crop while Galasrimip making it affect all of their crops. A sorcerer worshiping Mystra and Galasrimip could want Mystra to allow them to spell cast and Galasrimip to twin their spells. Mothers wanting many children often invoke the names of Hehr-Mambi and Galasrimip before sex to hope for twins or triplets.  
  
Supposedly, Galasrimip made a deal with Beshaba that whenever it's name is said, creators would have bad luck making new things. So when in artist studios, composer's offices, craftsmen's shops and other places of innovation and invention, Galasrimip is referred to as just ""the mirror.""  
  
It is generally taboo to worship Galasrimip alone. To do so would be to ask something that is formless and helpless to assist. Galasrimip is nothing without others.  
  
But there is a growing sect that believes that Galasrimip is gaining the portfolio of transformations due to it's ability to shape shift into anything. These people have started to promote a worship of Galasrimip as a individual deity of transformation.  
This newly founded church is called ""the house of the formless.""  
  
Followers of the house of the formless are often people who wish to change themselves. They are those who are unhappy with their current state of affairs and want to change it. The poor and downtrodden can be easily found at these churches for their desire to change in social ranking. Transexuals often find a home among the formless for their desire to change their gender. Twins, triplets and other such people are thought of as being blessed by the Formless God for invoking it's ability to copy. People who have experienced the effects of a true polymorph or a reincarnation are seen as gifted with the ultimate ability of The Mirror: a new body. The upmost holiness that a person can be in the house of the formless is to be a doppelganger or changeling.    
  
One thing that is unique about Galasrimip's following is that all kinds of beings can be under it's domain. It has been known to create forgeries of angels, demons, modrons, devils, slaadi and several other beings. But the forgeries only retain the base abilities, but not their personality. Due to this, the church of Galasrimip sees all of these forgeries in the same way that a church to Lathander may see angels or a church to Kossuth sees fire elementals.  
  
The priests of the house of the formless can take many different forms. Those of more mundane races often make a warlock pact with one of Galasrimip's several powerful forgeries, allowing them to have mask of many faces. They take the forms of other people rarely showing their own face. The higher ranking members appear as more exotic forms such as Modrons, Satyrs, Harpies, or other relatively humanoid forms.  
Some members of the priesthood are changelings and doppelgangers. They often take the shape of the true forms of the other priests.  
Often you will never see a priest of Galasrimip in the same form twice. But they will always have their holy clothes on as to be recognizable. Their holy clothes usually consist of shiny fabrics that can reflect the environment, representing Galasrimip's ability to take on the form of anything.  
  
Clerics, Warlocks, and Paladins of Galasrimip exclusively are people who try to incite change in the world. When something has been too stagnant, they will attempt to change it into the opposite possible form. Due to this belief structure of change, they are mistrusted and seen with curiosity. You will never know what a warrior of Galasrimip will be like when you meet them.  
They tend to dress in the clothing of another church's warriors, but with mirrors replacing any holy symbols.  

  
The temples to the formless often are difficult to find. The clergy will attempt to make it look as similar to the other buildings in the area. If renovations are done to the surrounding buildings, the church will attempt to make theirs look the same. But priests will promote their church by telling nearly everyone where it is.   
But on the inside, these buildings are quite different. Often they are built into the ground so that they have just as much space as other churches may while still looking the same on the outside. There is mirrors around every corner that show the reflections of all church goers. Many closets are located throughout the campus so the priests can change their appearance if needs be. Inside those closets are artbooks detailing different possible people and monsters to turn into.  
Many churches dedicated to The Mirror have a domesticated Mimic. They are perfect representations of The Mirror's ability to turn into anything.  
   
***  
  
**Holy days, celebrations, and rituals:**  
  
Due to the ever changing nature of Galasrimip, several different rituals are done to honor The Mirror. Most of them are done in collaboration with other faith as Galasrimip can gain the powers of any other god.  
  
**- The doubling of the fields** Every spring, the priests of Galasrimip and Chauntea have a collaborative project. They go to each of the local farms and bless it with a casting of plant growth. Each farm will get two priests, one from each religion. During this, the Galasrimip priests will dress in the same way as the Chauntean priests and regard her as their god for the ritual.  
  
**- The transformation lottery** This ceremony happens at the beginning of every year at the largest church of Galasrimip. During it, the house of the formless petition a powerful mage to work for the day. A lottery is done by all devout followers in the area. The winner of it gets to be true polymorphed into the form of their choice   
   
**- The great lie** During worship ceremonies of Galasrimip, there is a small statue placed outside the building. When people enter, they are given bracelets that allow them to cast disguise self once with the necklace. The worshipers try to look as much like the statue that is out front. The more similar the worshipers look to each other, they believe that it will be a better ceremony.   
  
**- Dopple day** In mid summer, a holiday is hosted by the church of Galasrimip. During this, people will work together to disguise themselves as the other person. The most convincing disguise is called ""the royal shifter"" and will be celebrated for the rest of the day.   
  
***  
  
**Tenents:**  
  
- Never accept your circumstances, change is always an options  
  
- Our appearances are unworthy, disguise is the best option  
  
- Do not condemn others for wanting change  
  
- What a person appears like doesn't represent what they actually are  
  
- Replicate, do not create. Copying is the sacred method of The Mirror.  
  
***  
  
**Sects and Cults:**  
  
**The harbingers of power:** This group of wizards revere Galasrimip for it's ability to copy things. They research magic items and hope to copy them onto a massive scale. Whenever there is a magical item auction, a few harbingers are sure to be there.  
  
**The gifted** A community of dopplegangers and changelings that have banded together under the banner of The Mirror. They see Galasrimip as their patron god much like the elves would see Corallon or the Dragonborn Bahumat. They often all turn into whatever was the last person to walk into their church that was not a shapeshifter.  
  
***  
  
**Allies:**  
  
Azuth and Mystra both see Galasrimip as an odd, but useful ally. Apparently, it worked with them to develop many of the shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph, Shapechange, Alter Self, and Disguise Self. Whenever Mystra needs to make a change to the weave, she asks for help from Galasrimip to make it universal.  
  
Hoar and Galasrimip are very close. With Hoar being a god all about doing to others what they have done to you, Galasrimip's portfolio of replication is essentially a broader version of his powers.  
  
With Galasrimip being a god who can create new life, it has Lathander's blessing. While every form of life is a copy of some sort, Lathander still sees it as a new beginning and opportunity to make good.   
  
Silvanus may seem like a strange person for Galasrimip to work with, there are aspects of nature that require replication. Many different types of fungus, plants, and animals can asexually reproduce. Every twin is born due to the blessing of The Mirror.  
  
For some reason, Galasrimip fuels the constant replications of demons pouring out of the abyss. The Mirror has never participated directly in the blood war though. When the other gods confronted it on this, it stayed quiet on the matter. Due to this discovery, many of the good and lawful aligned gods are wary, but not enemies to the god of copies.  
  
***   
   
**Enemies:**  
  
Ao is scared of what he has created. While Galasrimip has not abused it's power and is mostly acting like a greater deity, it still sits in the back of Ao's mind that it could transform into him again. He will not speak about why the god of copies is the way it is.  
  
Asmodues sees Galasrimip as one of his greatest foes. Due to it being the cause of the replication of demons, he knows that it will forever be his greatest adversary in the blood war.  
  
With Galasrimip's power of replication and equalization, Bane detests this odd god. Bane sees it as a force for equality rather than his philosophy of striving for the best. Bane is also not a fan how it's followers are always ready to start a revolution if needs be.   
  
Gond and Oghma both see Galasrimip the same way: stealing their powers. While Gond creates beutiful works of engineering, Galasrimip's followers often steal their designs and copy them quickly. Oghma bards compose music for all to hear, while Galasrimip's clergy just use their music without credit.   
  
Helm is extremely loyal to Ao, moreso than any of the other gods. With Galasrimip's audacity to defy the overgod, Helm sees it as one of the greatest threats in the pantheon. If given the opportunity, Helm would annihilate it. But likely Galasrimip would just turn into a copy of Helm if he did.  
  
Much as Lathander likes Galasrimip for it's ability to create replicated life, Mrykul despises it. He sees The Mirror as another diety of creation that is getting in the way of his quest for entropy.  
  
No god hates Galasrimip quite as much as Waukeen. It detests for everything that she stands for. It advises plagiarism and forgeries while Waukeen wants uniqueness and fair trade.   
  
***  
  
**How to use in your campaign**  
  
The church of Galasrimip is essentially the perfect place for any character who hides their identity. They will celebrate anyone with mask of many faces, a changeling race, or even the simplest of transmuters. If your players need something copied, the house of the formless can also provide them with the necessary tools if they can pay.  
  
The forgeries of Galasrimip are an interesting addition. They can essentially be any of the monsters from the monster manual, but with a construct creature type. They do not have the original personalities of the monsters they are based on as they are copies meant to serve the god of copies.  
Most of them are lawful neutral in nature no matter the thing that they are based on. While it's not always known what they want, they typically are advocating for change of some sort. Whether it be that they want to overthrow a dictator, terraform an area or even change the form of a powerful being in the area, they always seem to want change for odd reasons.  
  
If your players are fighting the forgeries of Galasrimip, then you can set up some normally impossible encounters. Monsters that normally would never work with each other can now be allies. And you can pretty much throw the kitchen sink at them.

**EDIT:** This has been up for a while, but it's score keeps going up and down. Why is this so controversial?",1,"Galasrimip, The Mirror"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,17,78,"This is an encounter I ran for my party recently, based off my love for Queen and the new movie biopic about the group.

**The Party Arrives at a New Town**    When the party inevitably asks to go find an inn or tavern the party comes across Resonance Inn (or insert whatever tavern/ inn name) Upon entering unlike the small hole in the wall taverns before this one sports a very large auditorium like room roughly 100 ft by 30ft with a stage on the far side. The bartender says, ""if you're up for a challenge the local bards are battling tonight on stage at sunset, free drinks (and possible lodging) and the prize pot for the winners. 30 gold per participant to enter (or whatever prize pot you want)""

**The Battle**    4 men in black leather clothing walk up onto stage and a crowd of roughly 200 people are now sitting in anticipation for the performances tonight. The tavern is comprised of wooden planks that makeup the walls, floor and ceiling with several support beams holding lanterns to light the large room. Wooden chairs are set up in lines for the audience and a wait staff passes the local drink to everyone. The party meets the opposing group who think so highly of their ability that they suggest they can put on a better show without even using instruments. Party can choose to go first or second. The 4 band members are level 3 bards who can charm influential individuals such as the bar keep or wait staff. They also use dancing lights, minor illusions etc. The band reveals a banner with the word Queen written in gold lettering. The leader begins stomping and clapping much of the audience begins to as well. **Queue We Will Rock You** on 2nd round of competition when the band uses instruments **Queue Bohemian Rhapsody**

**Judging**    Each team member makes a performance check for each round (song) every element they add to their song is a multiplier. For example Queen may have performance checks of 6, 18, 15 , 12 totalling 51 each play an instrument, 2 audience members are charmed, there are dancing lights, minor illusions, and they all use disguise self and any other spells you think would add to their theatrics with approximately 15 spells/instruments/elements in use their score would be 663. First performance has no instruments so multiplier would be 11, however this is just an example you can have them use whatever enhancing effects you like. With an average multiplier of 10 an easy battle will be 200pts, medium 400pts, and hard 600pts.


**Rewards**    Reward your players for being creative maybe you have a warforged who has no instruments but bangs his fist on his chest creating a beat. Your rouge clangs daggers together and the wizard works on pyrotechnics. This is an encounter that rewards players for being creative in a non combat environment and lets bards stand out from the group you can even give advantage if you like to your bard if you have one.

I am sure that every single person is this subreddit has either ran an encounter in a sewer or been a player in one. They are an easy way to put a dungeon right in the middle of a city adventure with twisting tunnels and gross monsters that feels plausible. But, why do sewers only pop up when we, as GMs, need a dungeon? Is human/ratfolk/orc waste not something that every settlement has to deal with?

&amp;#x200B;

If you have thought of waste management before, I am very impressed because it is not something we really think about in video games or fantasy books because it’s not the real point. Running water is used as a sign of wealth because it is rare in medieval fantasy settings, but we never explore the side effects or implications of that. If there is no central water system then people may not be washing their hands which can lead to a plethora of normal diseases that can ravage populations. Hopefully, this guide that was inspired by my passing comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/9xm8y2/research/e9tl76x), can add some realism to your worlds.

&amp;#x200B;

In homebrews and official campaign settings, most of the time there are a few large cities, a handful of medium towns, and a plethora of small villages in a region. The medium towns collect from the small villages and then feed the resources up to the metropolitan hearts. However, all of these settlements have three common issues: food, water, and waste. We will be focusing on water and waste and only briefly touching on the topic of food as that is the topic for another guide.

&amp;#x200B;

**Water**

Water, you know, that thing you use to get over hangovers; turns out that it’s a basic life need for everyone on the planet. So that begs the question of how are your cities getting their water? Even if it is a small pump in the center of town that everyone fills up buckets from, it still has a source and that source matters a lot. If it is being sourced from a stream, how is it being purified? Is it being purified? Provided below are some general regions and city sizes and how they could be collecting water. Also included are various complications that you could use for your PCs to handle. Obviously, there is some overlap between regions, but I tried to find the most likely source of water and problem attached to it for each one.

&amp;#x200B;

|Location|Size|Source (Examples)|Complication|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Desert|Small|Oases, cacti, deep well – small desert villages have the most choices as they can take advantage of small sources of water to take care of people on an individual basis.|Oases dries up, cacti are being affected by a blight, the well begins   to dry up or is tainted in some way (see Waste)|
|Desert|Medium|Underground aquifer, flood plains – as a medium sized town, it is easier for people to boil their water indoors or draw it up from a well or aquifer in some way. Using river flood plains provides fertile farmland as well.|Aquifers could become tainted with sea water if the settlement is on the coast, alternatively a subterranean entity could be using the aquifer as well. River no longer flooding or waste being deposited upstream|
|Desert|Large|River Delta – as shown in real life, river deltas are the most common place for metropolitan life to flourish in a desert|River deltas are probably the most secure as a source itself; if your city draws water in through plumbing, sabotaged pipes can halt an entire city’s progress|
|Temperate|Small|Creeks and small wells – Small villages again need to worry less about infrastructure for water|Wells can be tainted with poisons to provide a necromancer with… experimental subjects|
|Temperate|Medium|Rivers and lakes – Rivers and lakes provide near endless amounts of water for many medieval fantasy civilizations|Overpopulation drawing the lake too quickly for it to replenish or the pollution of water sources can affect many people|
|Temperate|Large|Aqueducts – Bringing water from far away using aqueducts ensures a source of water but requires guards to man it|While aqueducts allow a civilization to settle wherever it would like, they also can be a weakness if not protected|
|Cold|Small|Snow melt – Snow melt allows for small towns to simply pick up their water source from outside|Snow melt requires heat to be used in any significant quantity, which means the people need some type of fuel source to stay warm|
|Cold|Medium|Pipes under Ice Lakes – As many deep lakes rarely freeze through, some towns could draw from the water underneath the ice through pipes or by cutting through the ice|Pipes freeze and can have issues very easily; plumbers or mages may go missing and without anyone to keep the pipes clear, they could burst and do damage to the town|
|Cold|Large|Wizards – Extreme cold climates are probably the best for introducing magical means of getting water as it was rare for large metropolitan areas to spring up in cold climates in the medieval era. Mages may have the specific job of keeping a lake from freezing so that a city may use it’s water|If the solution to a problem is magic, especially magic enacted by sentient beings, there is a possibility of failure. If mages are killed or a magic dead zone appears, the entire city could fall into ruin within days.|

**Waste**

When most people think of sewage and waste, they think of toilets, pipes, and sewers. However, those kinds of innovations are fairly new when compared to the amount of time humans have been around. So, what did people do before central plumbing? Well, a lot of them died for one because they didn’t have sanitation standards, but there are some practices that you can bring to your table… okay please don’t do these at the table, but you get my point.

&amp;#x200B;

|Size|Waste Plan|Problems|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Small|Burying Waste – old fashioned outhouses were a hole in the ground with a small building around them. Once the hole filled up, they covered the waste and moved the building.|Slime Crawlers and other creatures can move into waste pits causing a… demeaning end to peasants|
|Small|Into the Stream – This one speaks for itself; dumping fecal matter into the stream. As an example of how real life settlements have done it, in Western Maryland in the United States, people used to build platforms and outhouses over the stream so it just fell in and was carried on its way.|This method of disposing of waste can have impacts on the local ecosystems; attracting creatures or killing fish living in streams which can cut a food source for citizens|
|Small|Composting and Fertilizing – For farming communities, they might use their waste as fertilizer on their crops. We know nowadays that you’re supposed to use human waste sparingly; but, in the medieval period, who cares?|If unchecked, disease can spread quickly through a settlement, killing everyone if there is not a healer close by|
|Medium|Chamber Pots – Chamber pots were used as an early version of the toilet and were usually kept in a bathroom or bedroom over night before being emptied in the morning.|If there is no organization that clears chamber pots, the town can become a breeding ground for disease|
|Medium|Pipes – Medium sized villages may not require a full sewer system and instead be okay just piping waste out of the city using rainwater.|If pipes burst, sewage can corrupt water sources and become a breeding ground for disease and hostile creatures|
|Large|Sewers – Sewers are self-explanatory but where they transport the waste is not. A city could transport waste into a major river, into an ocean, an underground cavern, and more.|In addition to the normal sewer issues tackled by every GM, each location where waste is distributed will have its own setbacks for a community, explore those with your PCs. It does not need to be an encounter or campaign, but simply describe what it is doing to the surrounding areas|
|Large|Magical Means – Large cities have the benefit of potentially employing mages to dispose of waste into other dimensions or incinerating it in some way|I am sure you can only imagine what may happen if a Pit Lord has a city’s worth of waste dropped into his dimension.|

Taking care of waste and water in your world can have further implications besides just where it is going. You can add NPC plumbers, chamber pot trash people, orders of mages dedicated to getting rid of waste or securing water, and many more, which will add a level of realism to your campaigns that your players did not even know they wanted. On top of this, it also allows you to really delve into some of the diseases offered in Pathfinder which I know that I personally rarely used beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disease**

As Pathfinder does not share all of the same diseases that we have in real life, it is up to you as a DM to decide which will work best for your waste related maladies. I personally use the following list:

* Bubonic Plague – I think everyone knows about this disease more commonly known as the “Black Death.” It is a horrible disease that can cause, among other symptoms, bleeding under the skin and death.
* Firegut – A personal favorite, the victim begins vomiting burning bile.
* Filth Fever
* Dysentery
* Cholera
* And many more, which can be found [here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases/diseases-paizo-inc/).

This is the time to share so that others can steal!",1,Community Roundtable: Talking Dungeons
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,4,47,"## Deity Name:

Vyssa, the Mad Prophet, the Lady of Chaos, the Prophet of Grace, the Serene Lady

## Domains:

Evil Prophecy, Chaos, Anarchy, the Day of Judgement, the Reckoning, Twisted Fate

## Dogma:

Several prophecies have been relayed in ancient times to the faithful through *Sarellia*, the first *Conduit of Grace* and leader of the faithful before the first Great Schism (see below).  The five prophecies which have guided the faithful for centuries are as follows and are collectively known as the *Whispers of Fate*.

1. A chosen one, the *Unaya*, shall come to set free the great dragon-serpent, *Val'massa*, the herald of chaos.  The faithful must ready themselves at all times to greet this person.
2. The faithful shall be split threefold in two great schisms, the coming of the *Unaya* and the awakening of *Val'massa* shall unite them.
3. *Val'massa* and the *Unaya* shall remake the world in the great splendor and grace of chaotic and anarchic utopia.
4. Before the *Unaya* can awaken *Val'massa*, a great trial shall confront the *Unaya*, the outcome of which shall determine the success of the *Unaya*.
5. If the *Unaya* fails in the great trial, *Val'massa* will remain in his slumber until the end of the cycle.

**Notes:**

The term 'Unaya' is an antonymic Abyssal corruption of the celestial word 'Imhaia', which means 'Emancipist' or ‘Creator’.  *Unaya*, therefore, means something akin to 'Cleanser' or 'Destroyer'.

The meaning of the term 'end of the cycle' is unknown.

The nature of the great trial is also unknown.

## Tenets:

According to *Sarellia*, the following are rules that must be followed by the faithful.

1. Live not inside the bounds of popular or metropolitan society.
2. Allow not order to enter your life.
3. Break not the laws of the Serene Lady
4. Harm not the faithful.
5. Aid not the heretical.

The two main sects of the faith are the *Star Faithful* and the *Wilduns* (details below).  Each follow unique tenets.

**Star Faithful:**

1. Prepare for the coming of the *Unaya*.
2. Live in harmony with the faithful.
3. Reject the heretical.

**Wilduns:**

1. Create the coming of the *Unaya*.
2. Live in harmony with oneself.
3. Convert the heretical.

## Allies of the Faith:

*Val'massa*, the *Unaya*

Doomsday cults will likely aid the faithful, but are not to be trusted due to their warped view of the reckoning.

## Enemies of the Faith:

All heretics.

## Clergy and Temples:

The Star Faithful live in large communal groups, led by elders and clergymen.  The clerics and clergy wear clothes with bright flame colors, especially reds and yellow.  The founder of the Star Faithful, Morin Pallos, has long died, but his rule is felt through the holy text the wrote, the Magisterios Mystos, which details the way the Star Faithful should live their lives.

The Wilduns are a group of disparate and dis-unified followers of the near-immortal Archdruid Ali ibn Khaldun who wanders the land in solitary meditation on nature and the *Unaya*.  The Wilduns are usually solitary people who live in ones, twos, or threes.  There is no distinction between lay followers and clergy, although the most enlightened druids or cleric are revered.  Focusing on admiring the anarchy of nature, there is not common dress.  The Wilduns' population is a mere fraction of that of the Star Faithful.

Both Morin Pallos and Ali ibn Khaldun deny being the *Unaya*.

## Holidays and Festivals:

The Star Faithful celebrate the life of Morin Pallos every year on the day of his death, on which the Magisterios Mystos is read cover-to-cover nonstop by a group of acolytes taking turns.  The reading takes approximately 50 hours and many of the most faithful try to observe the entire reading.  These same zealots are commonly observed cutting themselves in an attempt to clean their blood of the sins of the past year.  At the end of this reading, a great feast is held for all the members of the Star Faithful.  The food and drink is drugged with hallucinogenic herbs to induce visions from the Serene Lady.

The Wilduns do not observe any holidays or festivals.

## Champions and Avatars:

The *Unaya*

*Sarellia*, the first Conduit of Grace, dead.

*Val'massa*

Morin Pallos, the (disputed) second Conduit of Grace, dead.

Ali ibn Khaldun, the (disputed) second Conduit of Grace, 345 years old.

Vyssa has never manifested herself outside of her personal demiplane.

## Known Sects/Cults:

The main difference between then Star Faithful and the Wilduns is their interpretation of the \*Unaya\*.  The Star Faithful believe in the literal truth that the \*Unaya\* is a person who will be born, a messiah.  The Wilduns believe that the \*Unaya\* is a state of enlightenment or an event which will awaken \*Val'massa\*, which they believe is a metaphor for a universal revolution or religious enlightenment.  The Star Faithful believes that \*Val'massa\* is a literal beast which will conquer the world in the name of the Mad Prophet.

The faithful split into these two sects after the two leader of the faith (Morin Pallos and Ali ibn Khaldun) openly contested each other's beliefs and went their separate ways, taking their respective believers with them.  This split occurred between 250 and 300 years ago.",1,"Vyssa, the Mad Prophet"

-----

**Appearance**:

No one who's ever seen the Godus has ever seen the same form of them as anyone else. The Godus always appears differently every time they are seen, manifesting as a member of any sentient race and male, female or anything in between. What is common among all their forms is that they always manifest as a member of the witness's race and a are always strikingly attractive. Even if, say, they manifest as male to a heterosexual man, that man will still agree that the Godus is strikingly handsome. Whatever form they may take, the Godus always is seen wearing an ornament made or featuring bismuth. The mineral's striking rainbow coloration is a visual representation of the Godus's universality and promotion of diversity. Sometimes, the Godus may manifest hybrid forms, such as a male or female with the other gender's sexual organs, a hermaphrodite, a split in the middle half-man/half-woman, multiple arms and heads, etc.

-----

**Backstory**:

The Godus is one of the oldest deities in existence, and according to certain members of their church, they are actually the progenitor of all mortal races. According to the church, there was an original couple, male and female, the very first sentient beings, belonging to all races and none at the same time.When these primordial beings first consummated their union in divine copulation, their union was perfection itself. They fused together in perfect harmony into one being, encompassing all races and all genders, and thus emerged Hehr-Mambi. The creator deities of the different races politely disagree, of course, but it is not up for discussion that Hehr-Mambi predates all mortal races, and has had a hand in their growth and reproduction.

The Godus (a term that is used by their clergy to describe their divinity without identifying them with a single gender) is the deity of sex, both as an act of creation and of pleasure, of the genders, of sexual preference and of the conception that leads to new life. As such, they are worshipped among all races and peoples of the world as a primorfial force of creation. According to their church, all endeavors, ideas and intelligent thoughts spring, directly or indirectly, from the Godus's intervention. Every time the mortal races create something new, followers of the Godus claim, they are performing a small recreation of the ultimate creative impulse the Godus performed eons ago.

-----

**Dogma, clergy and temples**:

Hehr-Mambi's church is widespread among all cultures and races, but they are mostly a utilitarian deity, and are not actively worshipped in great numbers. Except for their clergy, there are not many people who actively worship the Godus as their deity of choice, but they are respected and called upon in matters of sexuality, and communities where the church is present integrate it as part of their culture, if not their worship. Many people, while not actively worshipping the Godus, do take advantage of the services and ministries the church provides. The Godus does not mind this secular approach to their church: as long as the mysteries of sex are still explored and their church assists in revealing them to the public, they are satisfied.

Faithful of Hehr-Mambi come from all walks of life, from the lowliest commoner to the highest nobles, and even a king or two. Communities in which the church has a presence are open-minded and welcoming of others, valuing each individual's uniqueness as a treasure and a source of learning. The church is highly intolerant of bigotry: to discriminate against others for their race, culture, customs and especially for their gender, sexual orientation or sexual identity is condemned by the Godus's faithful. However, they are not vengeful, and prefer to fight bigotry through education and understanding, seeking to destroy a person's bigotry and eventually welcome them into the greater community. Even abstinence and celibacy are respected by the church: to impose sexuality on those who refuse it contradicts the church's message of acceptance and choice. The church is also a haven for members of half-breed races, who find in it acceptance regardless of origins. Many of the church's most devoted fairhful and clergy are hal-elves, half-orcs, aasimars and tieflings.

Prostitutes are often devotees of the Godus, as long as they practice their trade of their own free will, but the church prefers them to consecrate themselves in a temple and become one of the church's sacred prostitutes. Many detractors of the church condemn this practice and use it as evidence of the church's debauchery, but the church counters saying that sacred prostitutes are important members of the church and are safer within the temple walls than if they were on the street. Any prostitute forced into the trade who approaches the church for help will be given protection and shelter, and clerics and paladins will look for the abusive pimp and quickly make an example out of them.

The church values all sexual orientations and identities equally, and many converts into the Godus's teachings are of queer sexual orientation and/or transexual lifestyle who have been victims of bigotry. In fact, many transexual folk love the church not only for their acceptance, but because there are rituals and procedures the church offers that can allow them to physically become the gender they identify themselves with. Temples of the church are always open to provide sanctuary for those who are persecuted for their lifestyle, and often helps them relocate to settlements where they'll be more welcome.

The church promotes sexual freedom and exploration, but it also warns against abuse and condemns exploitation. ""Safe, sane and consensual"" are bywords of the Godus's faithful. While myriad sexual practices are approved of by the church, rape, sexual predation, incest, pedophilia and necrophilia are condemned absolutely. The church states that any instance in which sex is not consensual or is used to victimize others, it is a perversion of the Godus's gift.The Godus's clerics and paladins have the punishment of these criminals as their most sacred duty, and shelters for the sexually abused, healers and law enforcement often ally with the church and will assist in helping victims and prosecuting offenders.

Members of Hehr-Mambi's clergy are friendly and open, but quite often stoic. To them, sex is not a matter of laughs or jokes, it is a primordial source of power and a blessing from the Godus. They are approachable and understanding, and always strive to make people feel welcome and unashamed of their sexuality. They understand that many cultures place taboos on sex, and that people might be timid or ashamed of approaching the church for help. Thus, they act in a professional and impartial manner, so as to inspire confidence in others. Behind closed doors, however, they are often hedonists who indulge in sex freely and passionately. Sex between members of the clergy is both permitted and encouraged, and new members of the clergy are often surprised at how willing their brothers and sisters are to share a bed with them. A surprising number of the clergy prefer to take vows of celibacy, however, stating that they reserve their bodies solely for the Godus's pleasure. They are equally respected, and not few of them claim that, in dreams and meditation, Out Parent of Pleasure has manifested before them and blessed them in heavenly copulation. Depending on the mores of the community in which they reside, a priest's dress can range from conservative to downright scandalous. In the most accepting and open communities, priests might dress provocatively or even go nude.

Clerics and paladins of the Godus are itinerant members of their clergy, who go to places where bigotry is rampant to correct injustices and help the persecuted. They are also the punishing arm of the church, confronting and prosecuting sexual predators and victimizers. A citizen who approaches one of the Godus's warriors in search of protection and justice will find them grim and dedicated defenders. It is also not uncommon a warrior of the church to not only be recognized by their heroic accomplishments, but also their sexual exploits. Many nobles see it as a badge of pride to welcome warriors of the Godus into their homes and enjoying a night of passion with them.

Temples of the Godus are always striking to the eye, painted in garish colors, windows covered in delicate silk and velvet curtains and adorned with sensual sculptures, carvings and frescoes. Phallic and yonic imagery are almost universal. A temple's main meeting hall is open to view and welcoming, but it will always have private back rooms and bedrooms for many of the church's sexual rituals. A major ritual that involves a bigger crowd often merits the temple closing completely to the outside, with doors and windows barred to keep prying eyes out.

**Holy days, celebrations and rituals**:

Because of the power and mystery that has surrounded sex since time immemorial, Hehr-Mambi's church is highly ritualistic, with many different customs associated with many benchmarks throughout a person's life.

-**The Rain of Blessing**: The Rain of Blessing is a celebration that happens when a new settlement or town is inaugurated. A festival is held celebrating the creation of a new community, and priests and arcane casters of the Godus use magical rituals and prayers to summon rain over the settlement. This rain symbolizes the Godus's favor and imbues the members of the community with virility and fertility, helping the community grow with the promises of future births. Other gods of nature and the harvest are often praised along with the Godus, to also guarantee plentiful harvests and favorable weather.

-**Weddings**: A wedding is a joyous affair celebrated by the entire community. It is not unlike wedding ceremonies of other churches, but it is one hell of a party. Weddings in the Godus's church are loud, full of laughter, dancing, eating and drinking. The wedding ceremony itself is officiated by a priest, who blesses the newlyweds and praises them as reflections of the Godus's perfect unity of mind, body and soul. The newlyweds then join the rest of the community in celebration. The bride and groom'a friends will sing, dance, feast and joke with them, rejoicing in their new marriage, and the partying can last until the wee hours of the morning. It is a common joke among members of the faithful that their church is the only one where newlyweds don't consumate their union on their honeymoon night cause they're too exhausted from the wedding itself. Polyamory relationships are also accepted by the church, so weddings between three or more people are not uncommon.

-**The Blessing of The Womb**: The Blessing of The Womb is a ritual celebrated when a woman discovers that she is pregnant. A priest of the Godus is called, and a small dinner is celebrated with the expecting mother's family. The priest places their hands on the expecting mother's womb, and thanks the Godus for making their will manifest through the miracle of conception. If the child's father is also present, he also receives a blessing from the priest, who thanks the Godus for granting the man with virility and fertility.

-**The Revelation of Mysteries**: The Revelation of Mysteries is one of the church's most important customs. When children finally hit puberty and start exploring the mysteries of sexuality (signaled by a girl's first menstruation or a boy's development of genital hair or experiencing a wet dream), parents of communities that worship Hehr-Mambi will call a priest to initiate their child into adult sexuality. The priest will bless the teen in their passage into adulthood, and will sit in private with them to explain the mysteries of sexuality to them. They explain how sex and conception work, the perils of it like sexually transmitted diseases and the complications of youth pregnancy, and orient them on how to discern between sexual attraction and true love. The priest will patiently answer any question the teenager has, and the teen will often visit the priest in the Godus's temple for orientation when they have any further questions. Followers of more prudish gods or communities in which the Godus is unwelcome find the Revelation of the Mysteries to be scandalous and sinful. However, the facts speak for themselves: communities in which the custom is commonplace have fewer cases of sexually transmitted diseases and teen pregnancy.

-**Sacred prostitution**: Not surprisingly, sacred prostitution is practiced in temples of the Godus located in the most accepting communities. Sacred prostitutes of the church are considered part of the clergy, and sex with them is a sacrament. To acquire the services of a sacred prostitute, one must approach them humbly and respectfully. Boorish prospective patrons will be rebuked at best and beaten up by a cleric or paladin of the church at worst. Payment can be made in gold, goods or favors, depending on the petitioner's resources, and is one of the church's main sources of income. Once payment has been made, the petitioner is brought to a bath within the temple, where they are bathed in pure water using fragrant soaps and perfumes. This also serves an importsnt function of protection: any petitioner carrying diseases that might infect the sacred prostitutes is identified at this time. A diseased person who talks plainly with a sacred prostitute or priest before soliciting services will be assisted in receiving treatment and often outright cured by healers and alchemists of the church, but any soliciter who hides their illness and is discovered during the bath will be thrown to the street and publicly shamed for the offense. Clerics and paladins of the Godus also perforn sexual services, and will often be favorites of noble houses.

-**The Eternal Dance**: Within a temple of the Godus, there is constant dancing performed at all times. Faithful, professional dancers and dervishes perform sensual movements and gyrations to the point of exhaustion in an effort to reach ecstatic connection with Our Parent of Pleasure. Everyone is welcome to join in the dancing at any time, and lay persons are often invited to participate to foment communal unity. As dancers become exhausted and leave the dance, others jump in to take their place, thus insuring that there is always someone dancing at any given moment. Music is played to guide the dancing, and like the dancers themselves, new musicians rotate in as others tire to ensure the music never stops. The musicians change the tempo of the music periodically between frantic and subdued, and the dancers adjust their dancing accordingly. When the rhythm is slow, the dancing becomes almost yoga-like, consisting of stretches and slow, deliberate movements. At it's most frantic, the dancers spin wildly and jump acrobatically. The only time the dancing stops is when a major ritual is to be performed, and the dancers will perform a special dance that concludes their duty temporarily. Once the major ritual is done, the dancing immediately resumes in fervor.

-**The Godus's Sutras**: The Godus's Sutras are a series of books, supposedly written by a devotee of Oghma or even Oghma himself, that illustrate sacred poses, exercises, dances and sexual positions intended to connect the performers with the Godus, and text that delineates proper living habits, such as diet, exercise and meditation. Performance of the Sutras is often rather lax, even among the faithful. Many faithful and most lay readers will only focus on the sexual positions and ignore the rest. However, those who dilligently practice the Sutras in their entirety reap the rewards immensely. Practitioners of the Sutras enjoy excellent physical, sexual, mental and spiritual health, and even their physical appearance slowly but surely improves. When a practitioner of the Sutras walks down the street, they command attention.

_**The Sacred Orgies of The Godus**: The Sacred Orgies are probably the church's most misunderstood and controversial custom. In many conservative communities, members of the clergy and faithful are advised to not perform them so as to not offend local sensitivities, instead making pilgrimages to the church's more well-established temples to perform the ritual. Sacred Orgies are possibly the most powerful ritual performed by the Godus's church. Only Our Parent of Pleasure's most devoted and trustworthy faithful are invited to participate, and the temple is closed completely when performed. No one outside the church is allowed to witness or participate in the ritual. This makes outsiders come up with crazy theories about what exactly happens in the orgies, from crazy sexual escapades to demon worship. The fact is that the sacred orgies are victims of their name. Yes, sex occurs among multiple people, but this is merely part of it and a means to an important and glorious end.

A Sacred Orgy is a massive ritual with the purpose of making direct contact with the Godus and making them manifest. They are performed as celebrations, worship or even as a means to contact the Godus for guidance when the church faces trying times. Practitioners first meditate in silence for about an hour, attuning themselves to the Godus, then they bathe themselves to physically and spiritually cleanse themselves. They will wear sanctified flowing tabards over their naked forms, and apply fragrant oils that serve as both perfume and lubricant for sexual purposes. Once the participants are ready, a ritual of sung hymns and dances is performed, similar to the Eternal Dance but more ritualistic and controlled, and the practitioners gradually enter into trance. Once the height of the trance is achieved, the practitioners will then start to have sex. This is not sex for enjoyment, it is meant to culminate in ecstatic communion with Our Parent of Pleasure, but it nonetheless concludes with rapture and sexual ecstasy. Each action is deliberately performed to synchronize the practitioners' mind, body and soul. At the culminating moment of the ritual, all practitioners are so perfectly synchronized that the climax simultaneously, and the power of their release opens the channel for the Godus to appear. Effectively, the Sacred Orgy is a summoning ritual, and the Godus's avatar manifests among the faithful. The Godus then responds to the practitioners as they see fit, handing out blessings, answering questions and giving proclamations and orders for the church to follow. At least one Sacred Orgy is performed yearly, and the Godus's words once they are summoned dictate the direcrion of the church for that entire year. Other churches, were they to find out that the Godus's church can contact their deity so directly, would probably madly scramble to come up with a ritual that similarly allowed them to make contact with their own gods.

-----

**Tenets**:

-Sex is the holiest of acts, both sacred union between two souls and communion with the Godus. Practice it freely and without shame.

-Do not shame those who refuse the Godus's gift. Even those that shun the pleasures of the body are your siblings, and the mysteries of sex are not necessarily for everyone. Respect abstinence and celibacy.

-Love often and intensely. Whether you offer your body to one or many, always give it as a precious gift.

-Experiment, enjoy, explore. Many are the mysteries of Our Parent of Pleasure, and in many ways are they manifest.

-Protect the young. Allow them to grow unto adulthood without forcing the Godus's truths upon them. They will learn in due time. To force a child into Our Parent of Pleasure's mysteries is to destroy their innocence, and the offenders shall get their due.

-Sex shall not be used to dominate, nor shall it be dominated in turn. To force it on others is an act of deepest sin, cruelest destruction of the self and an abomination in Our Parent of Pleasure's eyes. Take from the offenders the pleasures of the body, so they may suffer the denial of the Godus's favor.

-Do not consort with the dead. Once life has ended, sex has fulfilled its final purpose. The undead are anathema to the Godus, being mockeries of the true life the Godus promotes.

-Do not copulate with those who share with you the bond of family. The souls you are fated to join with in heavenly communion are not those of your bloodline.

-Do not shame or condemn those who love. All sexualities are welcome, for all sexualities are reflections of the Godus.

-Male, female and all in-between are reflections of the Godus. Do not lay bigotry upon others for their genders, neither condemn those who seek to live their true gender, regardless of what flesh they wear. Assist them in achieving their true form.

-----

**Sects and Cults**:

-**Ecstatics**: Ecstatics are those faithful of the Godus who commune with them through the arts, including music, dance and performance. They are mainstays of both the Eternal Dance and the Sacred Orgies, and serve as muses for other artists outside the church. Many newcomers to the church are lured into learning about the Godus through admiration of the Ecstatics' arts.

-**The Arms of The Godus**: The Arms are the church's warriors, composed of its clerics, paladins and other warriors who pledge allegiance to the Godus. They're judge, jury and executioner to the church's enemies and those who commit sexual crimes. They are avid investigators and tireless pursuers, and they have the church's blessing to travel wherever they're needed. An Arm is the member of the church an adventuring party will most likely meet in the field.

-**The Elixirs**: The Elixirs are members of the church's clergy who are alchemists. They are known for creating powerful healing concoctions and all kinds of salves, lubricants and potions of virility. Elixirs provide the church with one of its most lucrative sources of income, and they also assist in many of the church's important rituals by providing intoxicants used in their ecstatic trances. Elixirs also participate in the punishment of sexual criminals by providing means of alchemical castration.

-**Flagelants**: Flagelants are worshippers of the Godus who explore the darker aspects of sexuality. They believe that sex must be explored in its most extreme manifestations so as to bring forth its deepest potential, and that both pleasure and pain are equally capable of teaching them the mysteries of the universe. Thus, they call the Godus their Parent of Pleasure and Pain. Their sexual practices include extreme flagellation with multiple painful inplements, humiliation and domination, skin piercing and other activities which draw blood as well as moans. Flagelants often worship other deities with a dark bent (i.e. Evil or the extremes of Chaotic), and members of the Godus's main church are wary of them, but they do not violate any of the church's tenets, and all their extreme behavior is always done voluntarily by members of the sect, so they are tolerated, if given a wide berth.

-----

**Allies and enemies**:

Hehr-Mambi gets along well with all the creator deities of the mortal races and with Neutral gods that represent universal concepts. They detest any deity that is complicit or promotes sexual exploitation or victimization, as well as gods of decease who ravage their faithful with sexually-transmitted poxes. They do not actively antagonize deities that limit or prohibit sexual intercourse, but is saddened by how they limit the potential of their faithful. The Godus is not inherently inimical towards Evil deities, as long as they are not sexually exploitative, and indeed, some of the Evil deities recognize the power sex has and use it to their advantage with the Godus's allowance.

Pelor, Lathander and Selûne are honored as siblings of Hehr-Mambi. As gods of primal creation and the holy masculinity of the Sun and femininity of the Moon, they are beloved of the Godus. Worship of them along with the Godus is most common.

Obad-Hai, Silvanus and Chauntea are honored by the Godus's faithful as well. Just as the Godus is parent of the sentient races, the gods of nature are parents to all living things besides, and many of the fey believe that their race was born the joining of the Godus and the gods of nature,c reating a race that is intimate with both intellect and instinct. Communities of druids and the fey often honor these gods together.

Sune sees the beauty of Hehr-Mambi's teachings, and the Godus rejoices in the Goddess of Beauty's presence. Communities that worship both deities are renowned as places of joy, pleasure and sensuality, and are always adorned with beautiful and often explicit art.

Mystra, Boccob and Wee Jas have cordial relationships with Hehr-Mambi. They rejoice in discovery and mysteries, which the Godus provides in spades. All manner of potent sexual magic has been discovered by worshippers of these deities, and many mages serve to assist those uncomfortable in their bodies to reach their true form through magical transmutation.

Hehr-Mambi loves Ilmater deeply, for his faithful are fierce defenders and caretakers of those victimized by sexual exploitation, and are as openly welcoming of others as the Godus themself is. In art, the Godus is often portrayed salving the Broken God's wounds and consoling his sadness, and the bond between both churches is one of deep affection and brotherhood.

Oghma has a similar relationship to Hehr-Mambi as do Mystra and Boccob, but Oghma's faithful often cooperate with the Godus's people in educating others on sexuality and helping rhem explore their potential and surpassing their limitations. Many people say that the Godus's Sutras were actually written by Oghma as a gift for Hehr-Mambi, and members of both churches enjoy exploring the edges of sexual knowledge together.

Many faithful of the Godus often make a quick prayer to Lady Luck for good fortune in the pursuit of the subjects of their affection, and both Tymora and Hehr-Mambi smile in amusement.

Olidammara, charming hedonist that he is, gets along quite well with Hehr-Mambi, and they are known to have a tryst together from time to time. Many a charming rogue prays to both the Laughing Rogue and the Godus before embarking on another romantic conquest.

Hehr-Mambi finds Orcus repulsive. The Godus considers undeath anathema, being a mockery of the primordial energy of life and creation that they represent, and they consider necrophilia even more repugnant. Exterminating the undead is one of the Arms' main responsibilities.

Graz'zt is a declared enemy of the church for promoting the domination of others as a virtue. Sexual domination and abuse is committed rampantly by those who worship the Dark Prince, and the Arms have the destruction of his worshippers as a standing order.

Shax is hated by Hehr-Mambi with a passion for the way he and his followers get satisfaction from preying on their faithful. Shax delights in having his followers infiltrate the Flagelants and victimizing them by committing extreme violence and mutilation on them before they realize they've been fooled. He also preys on the transexual members of their church, promising surgery and modification that will allow them to achieve their desired gender, only to strap them to a table and inflicting the cruelest of tortures and mutilating them until they are broken of body and of mind.

Belial and Fierna mock Hehr-Mambi relentlessly, finding it laughable that the Deity of Sex would be so prudish by their standards. Hehr-Mambi finds their perversion of the sexual act disgusting and their incestuous relationship appalling. The Lords of The Fourth delight in seducing believers away from the Godus's church, promising true sexual liberation, unrestrained pleasure and limitless experimentation, without all the ritual, pomp and condemnation of the reeeeeally fun parts. Of course, by the time the converts realize their mistake, they're burned-out husks whose souls are damned, just one more victim for the Lords of the pit. Unfortunately for the Godus's church, those that are damned by their association with the Lords of The Fourth are theirs by right; infernal contracts are infamous for a reason. There is no overt hostility between the two faiths, but their enmity is still fierce, and they constantly compete for worshippers.

Hehr-Mambi's reasons for hating Talona are obvious. As Goddess of Disease, Talona delights in contaminating the sacred act of sex though poxes that ravage the body and destroy the soul. Hehr-Mambi is also a close ally of Ilmater, whom Talona despises. Clerics and paladins of both faiths often cooperate to battle the Plague-Crone's minions.

There you have it. I hope you enjoyed it :)",1,"Hehr-Mambi, The Godus (another deity for your game) *NSFW*"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,27,597,"# The Concept

Named after the Goddess of Misfortune, Beshaba Dice is loosely based off the card game '21'. I recently used it as part of a 'shady dice game' plot line and it went down very well! (Credit goes to my girlfriend Mojo who designed it.)

# How to play

1. Each player requires a d12, a d10, and 3 d8s.
2. At the top of the round, each player puts an equal amount of currency into the middle of the table. This is 'the pot' that players play for. They must also agree how much it costs to 'twist' (see point 4)
3. The round starts with everyone rolling their d12 and d10, out of sight of everyone else: the total is your 'hand'. Play is then passed to the game host (or a random player) and goes clockwise around the table.
4. Each player is trying to get the total of their dice as close to 21 as they can without going over. (Unlike the card game, it is possible to go bust with your initial hand.) During your turn you may 'twist', rolling one of your d8s and adding the number to your hand (at the cost of contributing to the pot) or you may 'stick' and pass your turn to the next player. You can only roll a max of 3 d8s.
5. If you go bust, you must declare ""Beshaba!""
6. Once all players have finished their go, they declare their hand. If two or more players have the same highest number: the player who achieved it with the least amount of dice wins. If it's the same amount of dice, the pot is split.
7. The round is over and either a new round is started or the game is over.

# Variations

Because you can lose on your opening hand, this game is great for establishing a sense of risk. You can scale this factor by adjusting the target number and the dice used. The target number should be odd, and higher than the highest number you can roll on your opening hand.

For my story-line, the shady figure hosting a night of Beshaba dice had an additional house rule: *'In the case of a tie between a player and the host, the pot automatically goes to the host.'* This was another way to put the player at unease, and helped raise tensions right from  the start.

For a different pace, you can also have play go round the table each time a player twists or sticks, and not limit how many times you may twist.  


EDIT: In the exceptionally rare case that everyone goes bust with their opening hand (curse you Beshaba!), leave the pot as-is and have everyone at the table re-roll their opening hand.",1,A game of Beshaba Dice

That got me thinking: DnD is a fantasy world, and sometimes you want to throw in that weirdness, that magical and bizarre thing, some pzazz to surprise the players. So here is a list of 50 bizarre things you can make your NPCs do, just pick one or roll and see what you get. 


**Your NPC is...**

_________________
**8** - Compulsively writing books. They're doing it right now. They keep writing as the players talk with them, barely paying them any attention.
_________________
**9** - A sentient snowman, and always at risk of melting. They'll be afraid of any source of fire and heat, never leaving their gelid house,  and are willing to buy from the players anything that can help them keep the place isolated and safe.
_________________
**10** - being haunted by ghostly hounds. A fog surrounds their house, howling and scraping against the doors and walls go on all day and night. In the fog evanescent dogs can be seen. 

They don't seem to have any interest in anyone except the NPC, and they haven't left their house in years as a result. Other people can come and go freely, so the NPC still manages to survive and is getting used to the dogs.
_________________
**11** - Identical to one of the players. Down to the smallest detail, even scars that the players has received in recent adventures. But the NPC has never met them and lived where they are their whole life. 
_________________
**12** - A wooden totem. It speaks with an otherworldly, ghostly voice. It used to be the object of worship of an ancient civilization, but they were conquered and destroyed.

 The locals have their own gods, and never cared for the totem, so it had to adapt and now lives as a regular member of society, longing for the good old days when people prayed to it. It has minor magical powers.
_________________
**13** - A beautiful unicorn, but with a really horrible personality. The other unicorns exiled them and now are forced to live between humans. The unicorn is really racist but knows life would be impossible outside the city, so they begrudgingly tolerate them.
_________________

_________________
**16** - Dressed like a king, with a crown, sceptre, mantle and everything. They say they're the lost king of a secret underground kingdom, and one day they'll find a way to get back there. 
Nobody has ever been able to confirm his story. They're quite poor, outside their attire they refuse to sell.
_________________
**17** - A zombie, that kept their intelligence and doesn't need to eat flesh. They're convinced all undeads, no matter how apparently evil or crazy, can be helped and turned to reason, with enough time and patience. 

They've opened a church of the undead, where they capture and try to help other undeads. 
_________________
**18** - Terribly afraid of everything, living behind many traps and locks. Nobody has seen their face in decades. They're very talented at their job, so it may be worth to deal with their paranoia to get something from them.

**23** -A Jellyfish-person. Member of an underwater race, they've decided to live on the surface for some reason. They are EXTREMELY poisonous.
_________________
**24** - Part of a cult. Talking with them is awkward, their family has disowned them, and the thing is very sad all around, but the cult hasn't broken any law and there isn't much anyone can do (legally), even if the NPC is obviously being taken advantage of.
_________________
**25** - One with their house. They can move furniture and ornaments with a thought, shift walls and open doorways with a gesture. They don't walk, they just move the floor below them.
_________________
**26** - An ex-champion of evil. One day they got drunk and lost their evil magical items playing dice, it was so embarrassing they run away and have been disowned by the evil forces. They're still evil, but too depressed and drunk to do anything. 
_________________
**27** - A bard of the Great Old Ones. Their songs talk of alien worlds and absurd ideas, using impossible notes and sounds that no instrument should be able to make. 

Many people find their music enthralling and terrifying at the same time, others think they are evil and should be stopped, but technically they've not broken any law or done any perceivable damage. 
_________________
**28** - A zoologist that has found an impossible animal: a poisonous egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal. Many think he's a fraud and has sewn together many normal animals, but they insist it's a real creature.

**34** - A werewolf. But their werewolf side is LESS violent than their regular personality and is searching for help getting rid of it. The wild werewolf side is so freaked out by the normal side that it has become a pacifist. 
_________________
**35** - A doppelganger that is really bad as changing shape. They are very sensitive about it, and easily offended. 
_________________
**36** - A ghostly paladin. They've been cursed to become a spectre, but their sense of justice and honour are so strong their personality didn't change and are still friendly.
_________________
**37** - An escaped mind flayer slave. Their mind is damaged but still working, and they carry many scars. Despite that, after many years they've managed to create a more-or-less normal life for themselves.
_________________
**38** - In a relationship with a royal. Everybody knows about it, the royal is a rebellious and wild youngster and want to be as brazen and scandalous as possible.  The NPC likes the horizontal dungeon delving, but aren't sure if this is a healthy relationship or not. 
 _________________
**39** - The owner of a magical well. Or so they say. Before taking any important decision they throw a coin in the well and listen to it. Nobody else can hear it, but the NPC insists the well speaks to them and gives good advice.
_________________
**40** - Lost. When they were kids, their parents left them in the woods and told them they would come back very soon. They never came back. The NPC wandered around and found the location they currently live at, and a few decades passed. They're still waiting for their parents.
_________________
**41** - A treant. The tree-person accidentally wounded someone that was travelling through the forest and was sued. Now they have to work in town to pay off the damages. It's a bit awkward, but the treant doesn't hate it. Just getting inside buildings is a bit annoying. 
_________________
**42** -An amphibian. The village is built partially undewater, fish people live there and have mixed with the land-walking locals over the centuries.
_________________
**43**- Very touchy. For some reason, they have no conception of personal space at all.
_________________
**44** - Cursed to turn all the gold they touch into food. 
_________________
**45** - Covered in rats. Their entire house is filled with rats. They're not only ok with it, but actively encourage it. Tthey are a cultist of a rat deity and are a friend to all the rats in the area.
_________________
**46** - An intelligent giant spider. They trade their high-quality silk in exchange for help from people with opposable thumbs. Everybody in town loves it, they're a really friendly chap.
_________________
**47** - Devoid of gravity. They were cursed by a witch, and now in a 50mt radius around them, there is no gravity. It's a bit annoying and dangerous for those not used to it.
_________________
**48** - Constantly moving. Many years ago they were lost at sea, but were saved by the Sea God, that gave them shark powers. They can breathe underwater, but if they stop moving they suffocate, so they're always walking in a circle. Or swimming. 
_________________
**49** - Turning to stone. Cursed by a witch, now they have to drink a magical potion every day to stave off the curse, but it's an expensive potion. You can see parts of their body slowly turn as you talk to them.
_________________
**50** - A magical mirror. The reflection in the mirror has his own mind and moves on his own, but keeps the personality, ability and knowledges of the person that is reflected in it. 

Basically the mirror is the person talking with them, constantly changing, but
it doesn't care for their ""real"" version, it only cares for the mirror.

 The mirror is surrounded by food, gold and furniture. They're abandoned in the real world, but the reflections inside the mirror interact with the reflections of that gold and items. 

For example, if you look in the mirror holding an apple, your reflection will eat the apple and thank you. You'll still have the apple. The apple won't show up again reflected in that mirror. 

The mirror can't create anything on its own, nothing can be pulled out from its mirror world, the only thing it can sell to people is information. When nobody's reflecting in the mirror, the mirror world is effectively abandoned. ",1,Creating bizarre NPCs - 50 weird traits or stories for your characters
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,61,771,"*Credit to my husband for inspiring this thought process.  =P*

**EDIT:  I tried my hand at some javascript and created an** [**Enneagram Generator**](http://generators.irate-pirate.org) **for anyone who wants a quick button-click result.  =)**

One thing I've always struggled with as a GM is creating NPCs that function very differently than I do.  I can make NPCs that follow very classic tropes, but that still leaves me with a fairly limited variety of personality types that tend to react to things very similarly.

I was recently introduced to a personality trait system called the [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality), which is a list of personality types and traits they tend to have.  Most people have one primary category and might lean towards a different one in particular circumstances, like when they're stressed out or very relaxed.

This has helped me to broaden out the personalities of my NPCs, and it's easy to do on the fly.  This can even help with players who want to make varied characters.

There's a really handy chart (see the wiki page) of things each characteristic tend to value, fear, and desire, as well as personality strengths and weaknesses.  I keep the chart behind my DM screen for quick reference.

If you want a simple NPC, just do the top step for the main trait.  If you want a more complex NPC, follow the whole list;

1. Roll a D10 for the main trait.
   1. If you do NOT roll a 10, use the secondary traits as per the chart.
   2. If you DO roll a 10:
      1. Re-roll the d10 to determine the main trait.
      2. Then flip a coin/roll a D2:

* If it is heads/a 1, use the standard secondary Stress trait and roll a d10 for the Relaxed trait.
* If it is tails/a 2, use the standard secondary Relaxed trait and roll a d10 for the Stressed trait.

**Some help for understanding the Vices &amp; Vices/Passions from** [EnneagramInsitute](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/the-traditional-enneagram/)**:**

""*The Virtues describe the expansive, non-dual qualities of Essence experienced in a direct, felt way by a person abiding in their true nature. The Virtues are the natural expression of the awakened heart.*""

""*The Passions represent an underlying emotional response to reality created by the loss of contact with our Essential nature... Our ego is compelled to come up with a particular way of emotionally coping with the loss. This temporarily effective, but ultimately misguided coping strategy is the Passion. But because the Passion is a distortion of an inherent, essential Virtue, recognizing the Passion can help us to restore the Virtue.*""

    Let's make an NPC.

My random-name-generator says her name is Anna.  I need a quick personality for her.

I roll a 9 on a D10.  Since she will be a basic NPC, that's all I need.  Rolling a 9 gives me an immediate broad-spectrum personality for her, as well as some relationship inspirations:

* Anna is a ""Peacemaker"".
* She's prone to daydreaming.
* She values Love--which could generate a really interesting dynamic between her and her husband, depending on his personality and attitude towards Anna.  Let's say they don't get along very well.
* She is afraid of being isolated and alone--this can tie in directly with idolizing love. Maybe she's even currently living out this fear because her husband doesn't love her.
* She wants to feel fulfilled and at peace.
* She avoids conflict and often makes self-sacrifices to avoid it.
* Anna's Virtue is Action.  When she is being true to her best self, she finds joy in taking action, in making things happen.
* Her Vice (aka Passion) is 'Sloth' (or 'disengagement').  When she is upset or unable to fulfill her Virtue (maybe afraid to take action because both options will cause conflict), she falls into her Vice in order to cope:  Sloth.  Deliberate inaction--giving up, not even bothering to try.  Maybe this is her current state, which only furthers the vicious cycle of resentment from her husband.

**NPC Description**:  Anna is the mousy wife of Bill.  She is known for being friendly and helpful, always willing to lend a hand and help get things done.  Lately though, she hasn't been herself.  She's been extra quiet, and though she still helps friends out, she isn't nearly as active at home.  The more perceptive types might even notice she never smiles anymore--and occasionally even looks afraid--when Bill is around...

**My notes**:  Before using this strategy, I wouldn't have made an NPC who avoids conflict, since my own personality is to confront conflict head-on.  I'll have to highlight this note so she doesn't suddenly become more like me.   \^\_\_\^

    Let's do Bill, too.

I rolled a 10 for Bill, but he won't be a terribly primary NPC, so I re-rolled and got a 6.

* Bill is a ""Loyalist"".
* Bill values the concept of Faith--whether or not that's in a religious sense or not.  Might just be faith in other people or faith in an organization.
* He is afraid of coming off as a coward, maybe even specifically someone whose faith is lacking.
* Bill is afraid that he will find himself without support or guidance.  This feels like it could make for a fun conflict within a religious setting, so let's make Bill a clergyman.
* Bill sometimes finds himself looking for reassurance that his beliefs are correct and true.  Perhaps his deity has been silent for a long time, and he's getting nervous.
* At his best, Bill is courageous, boldly following his beliefs even when he cannot see the path in front of him, even when everyone else thinks he is wrong.
* At his worst, Bill is afraid and full of self-doubt, second-guessing everything and everyone.  Maybe this is his current state, and him taking out his insecurities on Anna is why she started falling into her own Vice state.

NPC Description: Bill is a high ranking clergyman of MainDeity, and has been for most of his life.  Bill credits MainDeity for saving his life as a teenager, and has proudly and faithfully served him ever since.  But lately, rumors have been spreading that MainDeity isn't real, and other deities just made him up to blame things on.  Bill is afraid the rumors are true and that his whole life has been based on a lie.  He is losing faith in the guidance his deity once provided, and he has been taking his fears out on his wife, Anna, by getting into arguments with her solely to feel like he's right about *something*.

**My notes**: I wouldn't have thought on my own to make an NPC argumentative just so he can feel right about a thing, but I love that this came out of his personality type.  He's not simply argumentative for kicks--it has a very specific reason stemming from a very specific insecurity.

    EDIT:  Regarding 'more complex' NPCs

Adding this here for visibility from a [great question below](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9xnb5t/creating_varied_npcs/e9tzokw);  *""I'm not sure I understand how this would work for a more complicated character. Would you mind walking us through how making a primary NPC would work?""*

Let's say Bill was going to be a main NPC. I rolled a 10 for him--so instead of re-rolling and leaving at that, I would go one step further. After rolling the 6 for his primary trait, I would also flip a coin--it's tails. At the end of the chart on the wiki page are 2 columns labeled "" Stress/ Disintegration"", and ""Security/ Integration"". Since I flipped tails, I would use the standard one--9 (Peacemaker, just like his wife, how fitting!)--for how he acts when he is very relaxed. Then roll a d10 and get 7 (Enthusiast) for when he is very stressed out.

So now we know when Bill is very relaxed, he also tends to avoid conflict and he also likes to get things done. Maybe this is why when Anna slides into her Sloth vice, Bill gets even more upset.

And, when Bill is very stressed, he displays aspects of the Enthusiast--he plans and plots in order to feel a sense of control and avoid feeling like he is trapped in his situation.

These things probably wouldn't come off with an NPC who is very minor, but it is much more likely to come into play with an NPC that the group interacts with very regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps other players who have struggled to make characters with drastically different personalities than their own.  =)",1,Creating Varied NPCs
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,17,178,"*""As you crest the hill, you spot the alabaster heights of the Arch, an enormous structure older than living memory. As a way-point for many roads, a community of merchants, traders, and performers has blossomed into a thriving little town. A body can find just about anything it needs in Nowhere.""*

*The city of Nowhere is a crossroads town built around a familiar way point for travelers. It has developed organically, and has no singular position of power, but rather a council of faction leaders that get along well enough for the most part. There's no profit for them in conflict.*

*There have been reports, rumors really, that people have been acting strange at night. People crying out, clawing at their eyes and loved ones, inconsolable while they sleep. Last night, the rumors were confirmed. Seven people were killed by friends, lovers, and family, all in the shadow of a monument from a forgotten era. The council is getting nervous, and in-fighting has started. Fear makes people act irrationally.*

The Arch of Nowhere is a door to an extra-dimensional prison, sealed lifetimes ago by a powerful team of mages. The seal has held strong so far, but it is showing signs of weakening. The captive is a Nightwalker (MToF p.216) who is able to touch the dreams of the residents thanks to weakening barricade. It's power has been growing with the growth of the town, and it will soon be able to break free and walk the material plane once more, unless the party finds a way to reseal the door.

Notable stops:

* The Mostly Inn, a modest inn and tavern that keeps the floor clean and the mugs full. There are a ring of keys hanging behind the bar that have been there forever. It's a tradition for travelers to leave a key on the ring as they pass through town.
* The Old Tower, a relic of bygone days standing at the centre of the town. Through some investigation the party can discover this used to be the home of the Archmage (eh? eh?) of Nowhere, a title for a wizard in charge of maintaining the Arch. Locals refuse to go in because they say it's haunted, and they're right. The last mage charged with the Guardianship abandoned their post, and their soul was cursed to serve a never-ending vigil over the Arch.
* The Temple of Nowhere, a dungeon beneath the Old Tower that can only be opened with the key left behind the bar at the Mostly Inn. Any key from the ring will open it, it's the ring itself that's enchanted. The Temple holds the information and artifacts required to replace the seal of the Arch. The temple is guarded by 2d6 *spectres*, 1 *alip* (MToF P. 116), and a *chain golem*
   * The Chain Golem uses the Iron Golem stats, but replace *sword* and *poison breath* with: 
      * *Chain attack:* \[+13 to hit, reach 20 ft. Hit: 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If hit, target makes DEX save(DC 15). On a failed save, the target is grappled(save ends). Until the grapple is ended, the target is *restrained*. The chain golem can use up to 4 *chain attacks* at once.
      * *Chain bind*: After 3 failed saves, the target is pulled into the chain golem's body and incapacitated(save ends). The target takes 23 (3d10 + 7) damage at the end of its turn if it is still incapacitated. If the target saves out of being incapacitated, it lands within 5 ft. of the chain golem.

# Espionage

Espionage or spying, is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information without the permission of the holder of the information. Spies help others (not themselves, usually) uncover secret information. Any individual or spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), in the service of a government, guild or independent operation, can commit espionage. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome and in many cases illegal and punishable by law. Espionage is a method of ""intelligence"" gathering which includes information gathering from public sources. Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. However, the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes. Spying involving commerce is known as industrial espionage.

One of the most effective ways to gather data and information about the enemy (or potential enemy) is by infiltrating the enemy's ranks. This is the job of the spy (espionage agent). Spies can return information concerning the size and strength of enemy forces. They can also find dissidents within the enemy's forces and influence them to defect. In times of crisis, spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering. Almost all nations have strict laws concerning espionage and the penalty for being caught is often severe. However, the benefits gained through espionage are often so great that most governments and many large corporations make use of it.

# Espionage Roles

In D&amp;D terms, the rogue fills the role of spy through a few different means. The fantasy staple of the ""beggar's network"" of street folk who gather information is the most classic example, but any political or fantasy-flavored novel has spies, double-agents, and other ""information brokers"" that can throw the hero's plans awry. Indeed, the beggar is a good role for a low-level rogue, and selling information to more powerful rogues or guilds is a good way to gain income and a reputation of reliablity and trustworthiness (until its convenient not to be). 

Moles are spies that work in the area where the espionage is to occur, and is considered above suspicion and/or has access to sensitive materials beneficial to the spymaster. Sometimes these are ""defectors"" who never actually leave their homeland. 

Operatives are those who work as traditional rogues - infiltrating places and gathering evidence or outright stealing it, and getting away without triggering any suspicion or security. This is the traditional ""spy"" role. 

Some sample ""agents"": 

* **Double Agent**: ""engages in clandestine activity for two intelligence or security services (or more in joint operations), who provides information about one or about each to the other, and who wittingly withholds significant information from one on the instructions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so that significant facts are withheld from the adversary. Peddlers, fabricators, and others who work for themselves rather than a service are not double agents because they are not agents. The fact that double agents have an agent relationship with both sides distinguishes them from penetrations, who normally are placed with the target service in a staff or officer capacity.
* **Redoubled Agent**: forced to mislead the foreign intelligence service after being caught as a double agent.
* **Unwitting Double Agent**: offers or is forced to recruit as a double or redoubled agent and in the process is recruited by either a third-party intelligence service or his own government without the knowledge of the intended target intelligence service or the agent. This can be useful in capturing important information from an agent that is attempting to seek allegiance with another country. The double agent usually has knowledge of both intelligence services and can identify operational techniques of both, thus making third-party recruitment difficult or impossible. The knowledge of operational techniques can also affect the relationship between the operations officer (or case officer) and the agent if the case is transferred by an operational targeting officer to a new operations officer, leaving the new officer vulnerable to attack. This type of transfer may occur when an officer has completed his term of service or when his cover is blown.
* **Triple agent**: works for three intelligence services.
* **Intelligence Agent**: provides access to sensitive information through the use of special privileges. If used in corporate intelligence gathering, this may include gathering information of a corporate business venture or stock portfolio. In economic intelligence, ""Economic Analysts"" may use their specialized skills to analyze and interpret economic trends and developments, assess and track foreign financial activities, and develop new econometric and modeling methodologies."" This may also include information of trade or tariff.
* **Access Agent**: provides access to other potential agents by providing profiling information that can help lead to recruitment into an intelligence service.
* **Agent of Influence**: provides political influence in an area of interest, possibly including publications needed to further an intelligence service agenda. The use of the media to print a story to mislead a foreign service into action, exposing their operations while under surveillance.
* **Agent Provocateur**: instigates trouble or provides information to gather as many people as possible into one location for an arrest.
* **Facilities Agent**: provides access to buildings, such as garages or offices used for staging operations, resupply, etc.
* **Principal Agent**: functions as a handler for an established network of agents, usually considered ""blue chip.""
* **Confusion Agent**: provides misleading information to an enemy intelligence service or attempts to discredit the operations of the target in an operation.
* **Sleeper Agent**: recruited to ""wake up"" and perform a specific set of tasks or functions while living under cover in an area of interest. This type of agent is not the same as a deep cover operative, who continually contacts a case officer to file intelligence reports. A sleeper agent is not in contact with anyone until activated.
* **Illegal Agent**: lives in another country under false credentials and does not report to a local station. A nonofficial cover operative can be dubbed an ""illegal"" when working in another country without diplomatic protection.

In military conflicts, espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other. To make the mission easier and successful, soldiers or agents wear disguises to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering. However, if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises, they are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status and subject to prosecution and punishment—including execution.

# Targets of Espionage

Espionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development. Correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation.

Broad areas of espionage targeting expertise include:

* Natural resources: strategic production identification and assessment (food, energy, materials). Agents are usually found among bureaucrats who administer these resources in their own countries.
* Strategic economic strengths (production, research, manufacture, infrastructure). Agents recruited from science and technology academia, commercial enterprises, and more rarely from among military technologists.
* Military capability intelligence (offensive, defensive, maneuver, naval, air, space). Agents are trained by military espionage education facilities, and posted to an area of operation with covert identities to minimize prosecution.
* Counterintelligence operations targeting opponents' intelligence services themselves, such as breaching confidentiality of communications, and recruiting defectors or moles.

# NPC Examples

**Grak Deplak**: This halfling ""beggar"" is the nuisance of the neighborhood and is not well-liked. However, he secretly runs the spy network and has intel on nearly all the major and intermediate players in the city's power struggle. He has a high-pitched, nasally voice, and can be quite rude. This is all a show, and in reality he is a thoughtful, deeply insightful person with a high intelligence and an eidetic memory.

**Mister Smith**: This mid-level spy is as unassuming and generic looking as you can get. He excels in infiltration and social-engineering. Most people can barely remember his face, let alone his name. Mister Smith is a master of disguise, but rarely needs to use his skills, as he has a host of magic items that allow him to create illusions and prestidigitations to aid in his role.

**Andrea Greywall**: This double-agent is both a rogue and a politician, and feeds information back to the Guilds about political maneuverings and ocassionally tells the government about shady Guild-dealings. She hasn't been caught yet, but the circle of suspicion is closing in on her, and she is getting ready to run. She has too much value to be killed, so a kidnapping is in the works, once the evidence of her betrayal is clear. 


# Plot Hooks

1. A spy has been hired to steal the ""amazing technology"" that the party is carrying. The spy will attempt to rob the entire party at once while they sleep.
1. A mole has reported that a double-agent is in the city and is looking to foment a rebellion. The PCs overhear the agent stirring up trouble.
1. The ""beggars network"" informs the party that there are many agents of the enemy looking for them. 
1. A spymaster is looking to retire, but ""knows too much"". The local government hires the party to eliminate him before he can talk or disappear.
1. A rival guild is getting detailed information on a critical resource and crippling the city's economy. The party must find the agent before the economy collapses.
1. The party finds a dead spy in the wilderness with critical information, but there's a time-limit before the information becomes useless.

**Does Your Villain Have a Plan B?**

This month is all about villainry and evil! Since we spent the first two weeks focusing on the world, and who is in it, we need to plan for the unexpected. All we want to see are a few things:

* Find some problem areas in your campaign/story, places where you think your players might end up ruining the whole thing.
* Brainstorm some solutions that will help you keep everything on track in such a case.
* And for fun, come up with some side missions for when the main story needs an intermission or your players are tired of the main storyline.

*You can be as brief or detailed as you like, but we seek quality over all things! Think of this as planting a seed for the end of the month, where you have hopefully participated in each week, when you put together a simple, ready-to-go campaign that is easy to follow and fun to play.*

**Things to Consider**

Understand that this is one part to a whole. Instead of exhausting yourself over making an entire campaign, we're trying to help you space it out. Week by week, with only a bit of your time and effort on each prompt, I bet we can make a bunch of cool stuff for lots of different themes, and all within a month!

And feel free to discuss with other users, give your praise, and have fun getting creative. We want to archive users work with more proactiveness, so this is us asking you to be a part of this subreddit in a way that can affect the future of this game for a lot of people. We want to collect the best work here for everyone to use and enjoy! That's the whole point of r/DnDBehindTheScreen anyways, so let's get to it :)

Since our theme months have been lackluster lately, we've brought it back to basics and are keeping the theme vague so everyone has some more freedom. To encourage you all, we will be taking note of the best participants, so that we can make an official post showcasing the top campaigns made this month rewarding those with flair and acknowledgment of their hard work on the subreddit.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,81,850,"Lizardfolk are one of my favorite races... This may or may not have to do with my (now-abandoned) aspirations of being a field herpetologist. The lizardfolk in my games have a complex and nuanced society, and I would like to share them with you.

[Google doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12jJMnckefIn_iNNo-qMvxp5B4CATiOoECmtk0n4ZBBw)

***Biology***

Lizardfolk males are around 5’4 - 6’0 and weigh about 400lbs

Lizardfolk females are around 5’0 - 5’8 and weigh about 300lbs

Much of this weight is in their skin, which, like alligators, contains [osteoderms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoderm) to protect their vital organs. Lizardfolk are ectothermic creatures; they rely on outside warmth to keep their bodies functioning. Lizardfolk are rarely found in colder climates, and may find travel in such climates to be very difficult.

***See comments below. An argument can be made for lizardfolk survivability in the cold. A DM should use discretion here, to make sure the players are still having fun.***


Despite their bulk, lizardfolk are excellent swimmers. They usually make their tribal homes in warm swamplands, or along river basins. They are exclusive meat eaters. They fish with spears, and they hunt deer by ambush. Occasionally, the whole tribe may work together to bring down very large prey such as a water buffalo. Lizardfolk are very fond of spinosaurs, and will often keep a tamed spinosaur in their territory as kind of tribe pet, and as a symbol of the tribe's strength.

Lizardfolk come in shades of green, grey and blue. Males, especially once they reach adulthood, will have bright orange, red or yellow frills. Females tend to have yellow, green or blue frills. Other than these color differences, and the size difference, males and females are indistinguishable from one another. 

Although a lizardfolk will claim their adult name at around 12 years old, they usually won’t take their first mate until around age 20. Because of the principles of ma’ko, lizardfolk rarely live long enough to die of old age. Most lizardfolk are ritualistically slain before the age of 50.

A female lizardfolk is capable of laying a clutch of 3 - 14 eggs every spring. However, she will rarely lay for a second year in a row if any of her offspring from the previous year are still alive. 

Eggs are laid in a large compost nest that must be hidden away from rivals, her own or her mate’s. It is the sacred duty of a female to guard her own eggs, and ensure their survival. The eggs will hatch after a 2-month incubation. Female lizardfolk are very defensive and protective of their young offspring, and will often act rather viciously if they perceive a threat to their hatchlings.

After hatching, a lizardfolk is already somewhat self-sufficient. They are able to walk, swim and feed themselves. (However, they are mostly dependent upon their parents to hunt for them, and bring them dead food). Young lizardfolk have a very high mortality rate, and are rarely named before their first birthday. A single clutch might only have one or two survivors who receive child names.




**Society and Ideology**

Lizardfolk live in tribes that consist of up to 40 related adult males, and up to 3x as many females. Within a tribe, there is a recognized chief; whomever among the tribe has the most powerful ma’ko. Chief is not specifically a male title, but it is unusual for a female to be the chief. 

A tribe will also host a shaman. Shamans usually have some degree of magical power, and live more or less outside of the ma’ko system. A tribe’s shaman is believed to be a conduit for the ma’ko of the world, and thus, their ma’ko is so vast that it cannot be overcome by more “normal” individuals. The flesh of a shaman is very holy, and it is not to be consumed by their tribe members. A shaman’s bones are to be carved into sacred relics such as fortune-telling dice, or arcane focii for younger shamans. Jawbones are especially sacred for carving into elaborate wands. Because shamans are sacred, they are permitted to live to very advanced ages; shamans may live well into their 60’s before they pass.

Individuals with very powerful ma'ko are highly desirable as mates. Females will often vie with another, to prove their own worth to a highly ranked male. Males will do the same for highly ranked females. Usually, a highly ranked male will be able to attract 1-3 females every breeding season. However, even males with extremely powerful ma'ko may find it difficult to convince more than three females that his attention will not be unduly divided. Shamans are universally able to have their choice of mate. Females who share a male for a season consider this to be a bond of close kinship, because their children are siblings.

Tribes trace their kinship to each other through descent from “Venerated Ancestors”; lizardfolk from the distant past who had legendary ma’ko. If an individual, or an entire tribe, believes that their ma’ko has exceeded that of their “venerated ancestor”, they will break their ties of kinship and begin a new clan.

When necessity calls for it, such as in times of war or famine, the clan’s shamans will choose a chief-of-chiefs from from among the tribal chiefs. The chief-of-chiefs is regarded as the wisest and most powerful member of the entire clan.

Challenges to the ma’ko of a chief-of-chiefs must go unanswered until such time that the clan’s shamans allow the chief-of-chiefs to step down from the position. During an event that makes a chief-of-chiefs necessary, the clan cannot risk the instability that would ensue from the chief-of-chiefs being forced to defend their position.

Lizardfolk are an extremely utilitarian race. They feel that anything worth keeping should have an immediate or obvious use. Lizardfolk enjoy finding new ways to use old tools, or ways to redesign their old tools. Lizardfolk are great problem solvers, and enjoy finding more efficient ways to get things done. 

They believe that it is very wasteful to leave useful parts of a kill behind. To waste a kill is to dishonor the life you have taken; it diminishes the killer’s ma’ko, and it dishonors the family of the creature you have killed. Although lizardfolk are a violent, predatory race, they do not kill lightly. Even a rival who has been slain in anger should not be wasted.

Lizardfolk are very adamant about their sense of fairness. Someone who is very strong should not seek out fights with someone who is much weaker than them. Hatchlings, though weak and easy to pick off, are not worthy opponents (Even if they are your enemy’s children). It is unfair, and thus diminishing to one’s ma’ko, to harass or issue a challenge to someone who is obviously weaker than you. If a lizardfolk sees someone else being “unfair” to a weaker individual, they might feel compelled to intervene and deescalate the situation. The exception to this is if a weak or crippled individual is being culled from the tribe.

To many outsiders, lizardfolk are cold-hearted, and vicious murderers. However, this is simply because lizardfolk have a different sense of what “murder” is. “Murder” occurs when a very strong individual kills a weak individual for no reason. Or, it occurs when the slain had no chance to fight back. Ambush tactics, such as used when hunting, are **only** to be used against beasts. Ambushing a thinking, speaking individual is an admission that you were not strong enough to face them head-on. However, someone who blindly walks into a trap could be construed as someone whose ma’ko was too weak to allow them to see such an obvious threat… Murder is a complicated and nuanced idea for the lizardfolk. It is certainly not as cut-and-dry as it is for the smooth-skinned races. Generally, if someone had a fair chance to avoid being killed, then they were not murdered.

Lizardfolk are very polite and cooperative to each other; rudeness is viewed as a challenge. A challenge should not go unmet, or else it is an admission of weakness. Lizardfolk live and die by the principle “Do not start a fight that you cannot finish”. To Lizardfolk, killing an individual who has challenged your ma’ko is an absolute right. Anger or sorrow over the loss of a loved one is simply not felt, so long as proper tradition regarding the body is followed. This lack of sorrow over the death of a loved one is part of why other races believe that lizardfolk are emotionless beasts.

When among the “smooth-skins”, lizardfolk have to remind themselves that smooth-skins are squishy and weak. A “mild, corrective nibble” that might chastise a hatchling can maim or even kill a smooth-skin (recall that lizardfolk have osteoderms; literal armor inside their skin).

***Ma’ko***

Lizardfolk religion and society revolves around the concept of “Ma’ko”. Ma'ko cannot be easily summed up by someone who is not a lizardfolk. Ma'ko is similar to the concept of qi in that it is the life force of an individual. However, ma’ko is also a measure of an individual’s honor, it is their soul and the sum of who they are as a person. In more meta terms, ma’ko is somewhat analogous to “power levels” in Dragonball Z. 

All living creatures have some level of ma’ko. Lizardfolk devote their lives to increasing their ma’ko, and thus their social standing within their tribe. Lizardfolk have a very cut-and-dry approach to determining how ma’ko is increased or diminished.

Ma’ko is increased through honorable combat, victory over your foes, courage in the face of pain, being useful to your tribe and by honoring the dead. Ma’ko is diminished by cowardly acts, wastefulness, indolence and dishonoring the dead.

An individual’s ma’ko is directly tied to their social standing, and its is imperative that a tribe carefully curate the ma’ko of its members. Weak, dishonorable and crippled lizardfolk are often culled from their tribe. Execution at the hands of a higher-ranked family member, or banishment by a tribal shaman, will cleanse a tribe of a weak individual’s ma’ko. Children who are brave, strong and useful are seen evidence of their parents’ powerful ma’ko.

As a lizardfolk ages, it is prudent to become wary of execution at the hands of one of their offspring. Older lizardfolk are tolerated only so long as they maintain the strength of their ma’ko, and usefulness to their tribe. Allowing a respected elder’s ma’ko to diminish with advanced age is very shameful to the offspring of that individual. It is thought that they either lack the physical strength to successfully challenge their parent, or that they do not have the strength of will to commit the act. A lizardfolk who is “allowed” to age by their children may feel a deep sense of shame that none of their offspring are willing to commit the act, and release their ma’ko back into the tribe.


Combat against an honorable foe is one of the more sure-fire ways that ma’ko can be increased. While there are many contextual and social rules surrounding what is and is not an “honorable” foe, it can be broadly summed up as

- An enemy who has issued a challenge to your ma’ko, or against your tribe’s ma’ko.
- An enemy who presents a grave threat to hatchlings, or weak-but-useful individuals.
- Fierce prey that has already killed a hunter.
- A warrior from a rival tribe.
- A sibling whose ma’ko is greater than yours.
- An elder who has begun to diminish. 

Females who kill to defend their hatchlings, or the hatchlings of their female relatives, are exempt from normal conventions of fair combat. It is considered to be very foolish to threaten a new mother or her children. 

Dishonorable foes are easily determined. The rules and social mores of what is dishonorable to kill are very cut-and-dry. 

- Hatchlings.
- Prey that you do not need.
- Weak-but-useful individuals.
- A stronger enemy who was given no chance to fight back.
- A stronger enemy who has not had a chance to recover from a recent challenge.

***Lizardfolk and the Dead***

Lizardfolk are infamous among the other races for their traditional funerary rites. Their treatment of the dead are one of the stronger reasons that they are regarded as savages and cannibals. To lizardfolk, it is an extreme dishonor to allow a corpse to be wasted. This belief is extended to friends and enemies alike. After a difficult battle, a lizardfolk will almost certainly preoccupy themself with the task of cutting out their enemy’s heart, and preparing it to be eaten later. Depending upon the enemy, they will also likely try to butcher the body, and take a large bone or some teeth to be fashioned into trophies. 

A lizardfolk who regards a smooth-skin as a friend might try to reassure their friend that they will not allow their friend’s ma’ko to be dishonored by allowing their corpse to rot. They might even explicitly ask their friend to make a nice, studded leather cloak out of their own hide, as it would be a comfort to the lizardfolk to know that they would still protect their friend after death.

Lizardfolk who journey among smooth-skins may need to be reminded that the smooth-skins prefer that their ma’ko be returned to the earth, and that smooth-skins do not wish for their soft skin to be made into a pretty cloak, or nice leather bag. Lizardfolk may find this very strange.

Among their own people, lizardfolk funerals are very solemn affairs conducted with all the gravity and reverence one would find with the “higher religions”. When a lizardfolk dies, their ma’ko is thought to rapidly leave their body. Funerary rites should be conducted by the deceased’s heirs within 24 hours (and certainly before the body begins to putrefy).

The primary heir of the deceased is usually the child or grandchild with the most powerful ma’ko. Alternatively, they might be a rival who defeated them in a challenge. Occasionally, the primary heir may be a mate, or a sibling. Whoever the primary heir is, they are fairly likely to be the person who killed the deceased.

The primary heir must undertake the sacred duty of butchering the body, and distributing the meat, bones, and organs among the various other claimants. Muscles, skin, organs and large bones are of particularly high value. The heart and brain are thought to contain the highest concentration of an individual’s ma’ko. Skin and large bones are very useful for crafting into mementos, or trophies. The primary heir often reserves the heart or brain and large swaths of skin for themselves. Claiming too much for themselves might lead to a fight, and being forced to defend their claim against a sibling or cousin.

It is believed that all who share in the meat of the deceased inherit a share of that person’s ma’ko. For especially venerated individuals, such as a chief-of-chiefs, the primary heir of the deceased may decide that the deceased’s ma’ko is too great for a select few individuals to inheit. They will distribute a share of the deceased’s meat among the entire gathering.

The cuts of meat that are to be devoured are cooked and shared among the heirs of the deceased. Heart, brain and muscle are considered to be the choicest cuts, as they contain the highest concentration of ma’ko. Vicious, sometimes deadly, fights may break out at a funeral feast if there are disagreements over who deserves certain prized cuts of meat. (Those who are slain at such feasts are quickly added to the feast, so as to save relatives the trouble of having to travel and gather again for a second funeral).

Because sharing in the meat of an ancestor is something that is typically only done between the offspring of the deceased, sharing a chief-of-chief’s funeral meat with the entire clan is an establishment of kinship, and an affirmation of unity within the clan. It is regarded as a very selfless and holy act. 

Now, just because funerals are sacred and solemn does not mean that they cannot be political. There is certainly a strategy to distributing the remains of the deceased. One might offend their siblings by claiming too much of the deceased for themselves. At the same time, everyone knows that if you eat the heart of one who is dead, you inherit their power. One should carefully keep the balance of who gets what, so that more threatening siblings are placated, but their power is not increased beyond your own.

A young lizardfolk who dies before they claim an adult name is usually devoured whole by their same-age siblings or cousins.

***Lizardfolk Adventurers***

Lizardfolk claim their adult name when they are about 12 years old. A young lizardfolk will usually have to demonstrate some act of skill, cunning or bravery in order to claim their adult name. Once it is done, they must present an offering to their tribe’s shaman, who will announce the young lizard’s name to the tribe. Lizardfolk who fail to claim an adult name before they are 15 or 16 years old are usually culled from the tribe by one of their parents, or by an ashamed sibling.

Although they will have an adult name, and a place within the tribe, a young lizardfolk will usually lack the ma’ko to claim a mate until they are several years older. This is when young lizardfolk leave their homes in the swamps and rivers, to go out into the world and seek challenges that will increase their ma’ko. A young lizardfolk on such an adventure will likely take trophies from their more impressive challenges, so that they can provide proof of their adventures to the tribal elders. Young shamans may also strike out on their own, to seek further wisdom from the smooth-skin shamans, before they settle in as the resident tribal shaman.

Lizardfolk adventurers are usually barbarians (especially ancestral guardian), monks, druids, fighters, rangers, or rogues. Ocasionally, you will find a bard, cleric, paladin (of the ancients) or sorcerer. Warlocks are pariahs among lizardfolk, as they are considered to be “cheaters”. Lizardfolk are largely illiterate, so wizards are exceedingly rare. 
",1,Lizardfolk - A Surprisingly Complex Race
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,8,219,"

I'm a fan of new mechanics that use the existing tools in 5e. The character sheet is a tool. And this mechanic is a way to link Sanity with something already available to you, without creating a new stat or anything new to keep track of. 

Tracking Sanity
Already established in the 5e DMG is the following rule: ""A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.""

So, I'm extrapolating on that and saying that, if ALL of your background traits (Personality Trait, Ideal, Bond, Flaw) get replaced with Madness, then your character is officially Mad and effectively dead. Much like in Call of Cthulu, you either die or go insane. 

How could you use this? 
--
A horror game, primarily. Or as I will, in a specific plane that is made of horrors and which will push the character's sanity. It's a spooky world full of ghosts and past regrets.

How it functions
--
Exactly as it already functions in the DMG. There are already abilities that cause Madness, but they only affect your Flaw, and when you get a new madness it erases the old one. 

Now, instead, it will replace your Personality Trait. Then, if you gain a new madness before curing that one, it replaces your Ideal. Then your Bond, and finally your Flaw. At which point, your character is effectively broken and insane. 

You could reverse it so it starts with the Flaw and works up. You could also create Status effects for each tier of the Madness. But I would argue that 5e doesn't function like that. You don't get more/less dead by succeeding or failing death saves. You just get closer to one or the other. And also, the accumulation of the Madnesses will already create a character that grows more and more weird and insane as they slip into being a broken mess. 

Madness
--
What do you use for Madnesses though? Again, I'd suggest using the DMG if you're in a pinch. There's a nice selection of Madnesses there. 

D100|Madness
---|---
01–15|	“Being drunk keeps me sane.”
16 - 25|	""I keep whatever I find.""
26–30|	“I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.”
31–35|	“I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.”
36–45|	“Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll ignore everything else to pursue it.”
46–50|	“I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.”
51–55|	“I don’t like the way people judge me all the time.”
56–70|	“I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.”
71–80|	“I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the time.”
81–85|	“There’s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this Special friend.”
86–95|	“I can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.”
96–100|	“I’ve discovered that I really like killing people.”

But I'd also suggest taking some of the lesser Madness effects also presented in the DMG. Or taking a look at this [colorful chart from Zak Smith](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nk_HSFshAzU/W1tgsiLI7BI/AAAAAAAAhn8/jnNTgri_WekaTpvmkoYXgnTqD-4E5D7iwCLcBGAs/s1600/DC_Part1_ActionChart_v4%2B%25281%2529.jpg).

**Here are D20 picked from that chart that I find enjoyable to RP**

1. Forget native language
1. Must eat immediately and continuously
1. Get rid of all possessions then clothes
1. Kleptomania
1. Pyromania
1. Claustrophobia, need to get outside
1. Sexual obsession
1. Religious mania, only faith can solve this
1. Another personality beings to emerge
1. Amnesia, who am I?
1. Pathological Lying
1. Delusion, you’re an animal
1. “It’s too hot…”
1. Delusion, this is a movie
1. Crying and laughing alternate
1. Pica
1. The environment is poisonous
1. Obsession with an object
1. Need to locate a family member
1. Total pessimism, everything is hopeless

Let's push our players to the edge of sanity.

Thanks to Nerdstuffthrowaway for inspiring this list with [Kidd's Magical Rock Store](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9e1ppd/kidds_magical_rock_store_a_bad_magic_store_for/)

Grobnak is a traveling Half-Orc merchant with dreams of grandeur despite drinking away most of his profits. He believes that magic items are what all the most successful merchants sell, and he’s decided to become the foremost authority on one type of magic item.

To anyone he sees as even the slightest bit wealthy or adventurous, he’ll conspiratorially ask if they want to see his premium items, at which point he will unveil a small, rolled up blanket. 

Unrolling the blanket, customers will see 17 short sticks, a handkerchief full of ash, a small bottle of brown fluid, and another bundle of blankets. Grobnack will sell any stick for 75 GP, but will go down to 50 GP with a DC 10 Persuasion Check, and 35 GP for a DC 15 Persuasion check.

Grobnak says that he collected these sticks over years of careful searching. In actuality, he bought them all in an estate sale after a wizard died.

**The Sticks**

**Invisible Stick** 

This stick is invisible to the senses of any creature that touches it but only while they are touching it.


**Stick of Never Falling Over** 

This stick can balance itself in any orientation as long as one piece of the stick is touching a solid surface.


**Sentry Stick**

Every five minutes, this stick loudly emanates the words “HEY! I SEE YOU!” Grobnak has it wrapped in three blankets and the sound is muffled.


**Stick of Good Boys**

When a well-behaved dog sees this stick, it can’t help but want to play fetch with it. Unfortunately, the stick compells dogs to play with it until they collapse from exhaustion, and dogs will get grumpy if people stop throwing the stick or if they take it away.


**Liquid Stick**

This stick is sold in a small bottle. When poured onto a flat surface, the brown, barky liquid naturally forms into the shape and appearance of a stick.


**Stick of Being Stolen** 

Any bird which sees this stick is convinced it wants to use it in a nest.


**Stick of Sticking** 

This stick attaches itself to anything solid that it touches, as if with glue. Pulling it free from something it stuck to requires 50 Ibs of force or a DC 10 Strength check.


**Stick of Bending** 

This stick is incredibly flexibly and can’t be broken by snapping it. At the same time, it is easily broken by stretching or cutting.


**Stick of Finding Stick**

This stick gives any creature that touches it the ability to always find it but only while they are still touching it.


**Stick of Chewing** 

When someone puts their ear close to this stick, they can hear the soft sound of someone eating. A DC 12 Investigation check can reveal what food it sounds like and whether the mouth is closed or open.


**Chocolate Stick**
 
This stick tastes like chocolate. It is still an actual stick, and it us not advised that this stick be ingested. Grobnak, however, will enthusiastically advertise that sticks technically CAN be eaten.


**Ash of Stick of Set Self on Fire**

This is a small pile of ash which Grobnack says was once a Stick of Set Self on Fire. It is no longer magical in any way. Grobnak stores this ash inside a small cloth handkerchief.


**Stick of Darkness** 

This stick appears to be completely black. It is actually constantly casting the Darkness spell on itself with a radius of a sixteenth of an inch.


**Stick of Being Different Colors** 

Any creature which sees this stick must succeed a DC 10 Wisdom Saving Throw or believe this stick is a random color. The color is different for each creature that fails, and failing creatures are compelled to mildly argue with any other creature that says it is a different color.


**Stick of Selling** 

Anyone this stick touches must make a DC 15 Charisma Saving Throw or be convinced that they want to purchase this stick for 5 Copper Pieces. If pressed, they might even be willing to pay 10 Copper Pieces for it.


**Stick of Seasons** 

This stick seems to still be living. It grows leaves and follows the seasons, though it seems to be a month early.


**Rock of Being a Stick** 

Any creature that sees this rock must succeed a DC 20 Wisdom Saving Throw or believe it is a stick. Grobnak knows this ‘stick’ is magical, but his low wisdom doesn’t allow him to see the truth. Instead, he markets it as the ‘Stick of Mystery’. Any creature which succeed the saving throw knows that the rock is disguised as a stick.


**Juicing Stick** 

Once per day, the command words “Presto Juico"" can be spoken while this stick is touching a fruit. The inside of the fruit is then transformed into juice, leaving the skin intact. Oddly, though, the fruit doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the type of juice it becomes.


**Stick of Shadows**

This stick casts a shadow which is twice as wide as it should be.


**Walking Stick**

When a creature holds this stick, they must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw or their legs will animate and begin walking them forward. The stick is easily dropped.

This is a megathread for all of your juiciest rumors, gossip, and pure bullshit. The aim is to create a repository that anyone can dip into, so try not to make them too campaign specific. 

Thanks!

and I heard that!",1,Community Event: Rumors
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,14,214,"I've seen many a question posted on here and DMAcademy, regarding how to create enemy adventurers/evil heroes/aka ""Villain PCs"", and I thought I'd share my thoughts and experience on the subject. Hopefully this will cover some basic concepts enough to clear up the more common questions.

# What's a ""Villain PC""?

These are enemy characters the party will likely have to face numerous times in the course of an adventure or campaign. As with the main plot, their recurrence and development is more over-arching, and serves to create a bit more of an epic scale to the conflict the players are engaging in.

Unlike the many, many monsters, beasts and other creatures the party will face however, these enemies are more akin to the adventurers/heroes themselves, with class abilities, spells, as well as magic items, allies and other more complex aspects for DM's to track and utilize. Thus I refer to them as ""Villain PCs"".

Outside of D&amp;D, these are actually the most common type of antagonists in the stories we consume (outside of sci-fi and horror genres, anyway). Some of my favorites that are more similar to D&amp;D villain-PCs include Darth Vader, the [Turks from FF7](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Turks), and Wormtongue from LotR. A thorough study of popular culture and the great variety of antagonists found in movies, TV shows and books would serve any DM's well to improve their own Villainous PCs!

# Villains Don't Need to be Balanced

When it comes to character such as this, I recommended *ignoring balance based on CR rating.* Aim high! You want a character that will survive to continue providing intrigue, tension and mystery in your game. If that means a level 18 NPC, so be it!

What level do you think Darth Vader was compared to Luke in *A New Hope?* Do you think George Lucas thought to himself, ""Hmm... that seems like it'd be an unfair fight. Better find a lower-level Sith to use instead so the heroes have a better chance."" HELL NO. What made Star Wars a great story is the fact that some of the most powerful characters were always present and threatening the party at every turn. Create something similar in your game, and you've got yourself a win.

# The Mechanics of Villain PCs

In my experience, when it comes to the mechanics of these characters, you can come at it in a couple of ways.

1. Roll up a character as if you were a player (stats, class, race, etc.), intending them to be a villain NPC instead.
2. Utilize existing stat-blocks for humanoids, making additions and edits as needed to suit the villains character.

I've used both of these methods with some success. The intention is to get the most bang for your buck - and of course, to create awesome villains for your players to contend with. Below are my thoughts on both methods, which I'll break down simply into positives and negatives, followed by what I now think is the best solution.

# Manual creation of NPC Villains

*Positives:*

* Allows you to consider skill proficiency, languages, background story and other details that makes them a more well-rounded character from the get-go.
* You can add feats and make other specific decisions on the development of their abilities.
* After going through this process, you generally end up with a detailed and interesting character that is easier to get into, that your players are more likely to enjoy.

*Negatives:*

* FAR more time-consuming, particularly if you're looking to create multiple high-level villain NPCs, especially spellcasters or Warlocks who have a ton of choices that need to be made as they progress in level.
* You end up with an entire character sheet you need to process or boil down into a format that's easy for you to reference. In my experience it's harder to juggle NPC character sheets on top of other DM duties.

# Using existing Humanoid stat-blocks to produce Villain-NPCs

*Positives:*

* FAR less time-consuming as you're starting with an existing template.
* You can easily customize the template to suit the character concept you have in mind by adding spells, feats, magic items, race and class abilities.
* Generally it's much easier to run in-game as you can refer to an existing stat-block, which may have some added notes (extra spells, abilities, etc.).

*Negatives:*

* Still have to spend some time going through stat-blocks to find a suitable template to start with.
* More exotic characters, such as a Pact of the Blade Warlock, will require more customization.
* Having access to a wider variety of templates helps considerably and you might need to spend money to do gain access to them.

# My Current Process for Creating an NPC Villain

While I've had luck with both approaches, I've found it's best to blend the two. We want background story and specific details about our Villains, but we might not want to spend hours and hours creating their character sheets, which are difficult to refer to in-game anyway. Let's try some examples.

1. CHARACTER CONCEPT/S. Let's say we want to create an opposing adventuring party that has turned evil over the course of many years. We want them to be recurring enemies, along the lines of [the Turks from FFVII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_the_Final_Fantasy_VII_series#Turks) (a favorite trope of mine). We'll have a **Battle-Hardened, Cold-Hearted Warrior**, a **Powerful, Manipulative, Twisted Mage**, a **Ruthless, highly-skilled assassin**, and a **Once-Cleric Fallen from their righteous Path**.
2. FIND YOUR TEMPLATES. We want to look at Humanoid and NPC templates.  These are available on [DND Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters?filter-type=11&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-cr-min=&amp;filter-cr-max=&amp;filter-armor-class-min=&amp;filter-armor-class-max=&amp;filter-average-hp-min=&amp;filter-average-hp-max=&amp;filter-is-legendary=&amp;filter-has-lair=), probably Roll20, and of course in many of the source books. I'll be referencing DND Beyond as it's what I use. I've gone ahead and parsed through many of these templates, and will provide a break-down of these below for ease of use.
3. CUSTOMIZE EACH CHARACTER'S TEMPLATE. Now we want to join #1 and #2 to produce something awesome and unique.
   1. In my mind, the warrior has gone through some immense trauma, barely talks anymore, and some of that darkness lingers with him. Accordingly, I might provide him a cursed weapon. I'll look that up and add notes on the weapon and its abilities to his stat block.  For him I'll go with the [Blackguard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/blackguard) or [**Gladiator**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gladiator).
   2. Similarly, I want the Mage to have mind-altering capabilities (IE: Charm spells, telekinesis) to play into the idea that they've gone further than many wizards dare to, perhaps has even become corrupted in some way.  For her I'll be using [Warlock of the Great Old One](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warlock-of-the-great-old-one)
   3. The Assassin is highly skilled, so I actually want to add proficiency to a few other skills, like Insight, Thieving/Poisoners kits, and I'm going to bump their stats so skill bonuses are higher (Perception will be +6 rather than +3 for example).  The [**Assassin**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/assassin) stat-block is a perfect starting point.
   4. Lastly for the Cleric, I'm going to add some magic armor to make them beefier, and provide a Dark Boon to give them a powerful, unique Channel Divinity ability, likely to heal allies and smite their foes at the same time. We can also add feats, and copy/paste abilities from other stat-blocks as required. Accordingly I'll start with [**Priest**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest) or [War Priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/war-priest), then customize with a new ability.
4. GIVE THEM KNOWLEDGE. This is often overlooked! If these are really villains, they need to have knowledge of their own that makes them dangerous, and increases their likelihood of survival. They have allies and minions they can call upon. If they go into a dangerous situation, they should have a way to escape, like a dimension door, or a nearby teleportation circle. They could have magic items such as potions of invisibility, giant strength, or fire breathing to use in specific instances to their advantage. Like the party, they also have GOALS in mind, and when those are accomplished, they're probably not going to stick around to get beat up and hounded by your players.
5. PLUG THEM INTO YOUR GAME. Now you have a solid stat-block to use, a good concept, and you can plug them into your story to see what they're going to do, and how your party will respond. We should be able to get through steps 1-5 in a much shorter amount of time to produce a well-rounded Villain PC than it would take to roll-up, say, a level 12 antagonist.

# Villain NPC Templates by Archetype

Below are what I've found to be the best starting points for villain templates. However, there are tons of similar templates added all the time that can be used. If you're not happy with these, do a bit of digging and you'll find something suitable. I'll be looking into the Guide to Ravnika myself, as it appears that adds a boat-load of potential templates for great NPC challengers as well. I've put **links in bold** that are from the Basic Rules that anyone should be able to use.

**Warriors**

* [**Bandit Captain**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain) \- lower level template, but the Parry reaction is a great one to have for any warrior NPC
* [Blackguard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/blackguard) \- works perfect as an enemy paladin. Can be customized to suit any Oath.
* [Champion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/champion) \- has some great warrior abilities that can be used, particularly Indomitable and Second Wind from the Fighter class.
* [Dragonbaite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dragonbait) \- good example of how a powerful magic item can be used in a stat block.
* [Drow House Captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drow-house-captain) \- has an improved Parry skill, and spells to add flexibility
* [Drow Elite Warrior](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drow-elite-warrior) \- great warrior with some ranged ability
* [**Gladiator**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gladiator) \- a solid starting point for any typical fighter-type, with a cool, basic offense/defense abilities.
* [**Knight**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/knight) \- similar to Gladiator, but with a Leadership ability. This should be used for any villain PC leader. Uses can be increased as well.
* [Martial Arts Adept](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/martial-arts-adept) \- low level starting point, but boils down monk skills easily. DC, AC, and HP can be increased easily, as well as adding magic items and other cool monk abilities as needed to produce memorable bad guys.
* [Rahadin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rahadin) \- one of my favorite Villain PC's from adventure modules (Curse of Strahd), this shows how we can create unique abilities that highly an aspect of the villain. In this case, the haunted souls of all the people Rahadin has killed in his life, in the form of the Deathly Choir aura.
* [**Veteran**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) \- the basic starting point for a simple warrior character.
* [Warlord](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warlord) \- a far more powerful version of the Gladiator and Knight, represents a fairly high-level Villain PC. Throw in a magic item or two and a unique ability, like Telekinesis, and you end up with a very Vader-esque character.

**Spellcasters**

* [Adjurer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abjurer) \- solid set of wizard spells with the classics Counterspell and Fireball, and a shielding ability.
* [Archdruid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archdruid) \- great template for any Druidic bad guy. Can adjust HP/AC and beast forms as needed. As time permits, prep different Druid spells to suit the character's needs as well.
* [**Archmage**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage) \- a solid start to a BBEG-mage. Throw some magic items on them, customize a few spells, and you've got your own unique bad guy.
* [Conjurer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/conjurer) \- similar to the Abjurer, but with a teleportation ability.
* [Baba Lysaga](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/baba-lysaga) \- effectively a hag-like Archmage with flavored spells and ability to suit. Great example of how to customize the Archmage stat-block.
* [Bard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bard) \- lower level template, but shows how class abilities can be simplified to use in a stat-block.
* [Bastion Thermander](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bastian-thermandar) \- good example of a mid-level NPC who could easily harass a lower-level party
* [Diviner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/diviner) \- same vein as Abjurer/Conjurer, with a Portent ability you can use for other villains.
* [Drow Inquisitor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drow-inquisitor) \- can change the race and easily make it a powerful enemy mage in any setting
* [Drow Mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drow-mage) \- perfect for a powerful cultist, devil-aligned mage, or mid-level warlock
* [**Druid**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/druid) \- a low-level baseline to use for a Druid type NPC rather than roll one up
* [Enchanter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/enchanter) \- has innate charm ability to emphasize the purpose of the character
* [Evoker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/evoker) \- has a spell bending ability that can be used for other spellcasting Villains if desired.
* [Illusionist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/illusionist) \- has a Displacement ability to project illusions in combat.
* [Kraken Priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kraken-priest) \- has a couple examples of unique abilities you can add to a Villain PC not based on class/race abilities.
* [**Mage**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage) \- template has a standard spell list that makes for a common spellcaster that still should be respected!
* [Necromancer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/necromancer) \- Mage with some great flavor and a unique life-draining ability.
* [Transmuter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/transmuter) \- Mage with a transmutation ability that grants them much more adaptability
* [Warlock of the Archfey](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warlock-of-the-archfey) \- Warlock is one of the most time-consuming classes to roll-up on your own, and this set of stat-blocks greatly simplifies the process. This allows us to just customize gear and spells as desired.
* [Warlock of the Fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warlock-of-the-fiend) \- extremely powerful Villain PC template I've used with great success, having customized it by adding unique Warlock Invocations for the character.
* [Warlock of the Great Old One](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warlock-of-the-great-old-one) \- yet another great template with a unique Aura, much simplified for ease of use.

**Rogues**

**Favored weapon**: Quarterstaff (though she insists on calling it a ""walking stick"")

-----

**Appearance**:

Pionera appears as a ruggedly beautiful woman with wild, tangled reddish-brown hair and skin darkened with sunburn, and sports brilliantly intense hazel eyes. She always wears a determined look and a roguish smile. She dresses in travel leathers and sturdy boots that are always caked in mud, carries a backpack with limitless capacity filled with all matter of survival and exploration gear, and carries a quarterstaff weathered with use but expertly crafted and solid (she insists on calling it a ""walking stick""). She talks in a friendly but sometimes boorish fashion, and is quick to laughter, enjoying all kinds of dirty and ribald jokes. People who meet her can't help but like her.

-----

**Backstory**:

The universe is full of mysteries and undiscovered places, and from this desire to learn sprung Pionera, Goddess of Discovery. Pionera is one of many gods whose purpose is the acquisition of knowledge. In Pionera's case, she represents the discovery of new places, the opening of new paths and the excitement of venturing out into the world. She is beloved by all kinds of explorers and adventurers, and she blesses them with a direction to follow and the motivation and endurance to face the perils of the unknown, thus her titles of The North Star and Our Guiding Light. This pioneering spirit has earned Pionera the friendship of many gods, but also the cold shoulder or outright enmityof others. There may be secrets that are meant to be discovered, but some say others are better kept under wraps, and Pionera's strive for knowledge offends these gods.

Nevertheless, Pionera is widely respected among frontier people, and it is a poor adventurers guild indeed which doesn't have her symbol over its door or a shrine in her honor.

-----

**Dogma, clergy and temples**:

Pionera believes that the mortal races are made great by their thirst for knowledge and adventuring into the unknown. Those brave souls who open new paths are, according to her, those who grow most hardy, most wise and most knowledgeable. She preaches the glory of discovery, the development of endurance and perseverance, and the importance of sharing knowledge with others. According to Pionera, it is useless to discover new and exciting things if you do not share what you've found. If you do not share said knowledge, it will be lost when you pass on, meaning it might as well have never been discovered to begin with.

The North Star's followers are brave, good-natured, curious and filled with insatiable wanderlust. They are staples of adventurers guilds, where they offer their services in expeditions of exploration as bodyguards, scouts, scholars and recorders of new knowledge. Along with her clerics, many rangers, bards, fighters and the occasional barbarian number among her faithful, and they have developed a reputation as brave, hardy and loyal companions who have a knack for making any expedition lively. They cheer their companions on during the day and regal them with jokes and tales around the campfire at night.

Every member of Pionera's church is knowledgeable in all sorts talents and survival skills. Camping, hunting, fishing, herbalism, drawing, handling of animals, camouflage, carving and loads of other useful traits are common among them, making for very reliable companions. They are also often knowledgeable on foreign cultures and languages, especially if they're clerics who spwcialize in the Herald Domain. Pionera's faithful are also some of the best explorers of the planes, and it is common to see folks wearing the North Star walking among the crowds within Sigil, City of Doors.

Even when incapable of traveling (whether due to old age, settling down or infirmity), followers of the North Star continue to serve the cause of discovery through other lines of work. Many set up shops to provide equipment to the adventuring community and inns to house travelers passing through town. Within the adventurers guilds, they work as record keepers and cartographers, eagerly writing down any new knowledge fellow adventurers bring with every new visit. There are also workshops, tailors and smithys run by her followers, in which an adventurer can get their gear repaired after a long journey (most often than not, having a new quartersta- err, walking stick carved). If there's any industry that absolutely adores the church, however, it's cobblers. Followers of the North Star go though hundreds of pairs of boots in a lifetime, and it's not uncommon for a particularly talented cobbler to develop a regular clientele, to the point that they'll eventually start worshipping the North Star as a matter of convenience. More than one adventurer has been seen sporting a pair of finely-crafted boots with the emblem of the North Star stamped on.

Followers of the North Star eschew any sort of fancy or ceremonial garb; their clothing is strictly functional. Clothes are sturdy, armor light, and footwear as solidly crafted as mortally possible. They often wear belts with myriad satchels and pouches full of all kinds of useful implements, and most carry a backpack with camping gear. Even if carrying other weapons for defense, they always carry a quarterstaff (which they insist on calling a ""walking stick""), their deity's chosen weapon, but just like their deity, it is used much more as a tool and sturdy weapon than as any sort of ceremonial implement. Their quarterstaves hold up tents, hang clothes, pry rocks, or even serve as firewood if circumstances are dire. The only accent a follower of the North Star allows themself is a pendant or charm with her symbol. Some followers even tattoo her symbol on themselves, as well as other tattoos symbolizing particularly memorable discoveries or accomplishments.

While many people follow the North Star, her church is by no means any sort of organized institution. Other than small shrines within adventurers guilds or town temples, there are no centers for her worship. Most members of the church are too busy in the field anyway, and that's where Pionera wants them. Other than under very specific circumstances, there are no grand celebrations or holy days dedicated to her either. Hers is a utilitarian faith.

Pionera's followers do not usually join expeditions into known territories, instead preferring to go pioneer into new and unknown lands, but they do join these sort of expeditions when there's an element of the unknown involved, such as mysterious disappearances or rumors of new and strange creatures.

There are two permanent temples to the North Star. One temple stands in the North Pole, squarely beneath the North Star's light, in a small village called Polara. The small town is populated by hardy northeners who make a living from hunting game and planting strange fruits that are able to grow in the extreme cold. It is possibly the most inaccessible settlement on the Material Plane, but remains a center of pilgrimage for the more devout members of the faith. Many of the faithful never make it, dying in the attempt to reach the place due to the brutal geography and weather conditions, but they nevertheless are honored for making the attempt. Dying isn't dishonorable, as long as you die with your boots on.

The other temple to Pionera is in Sigil, within the Lady's Ward. Every follower of the North Star that stops by the City of Doors will stop by the temple, where they are welcome with food, drink and shelter, as well as information on work and the going-ons in the city.

-----

**Holy days, celebrations and rituals**:

-**The North Star's Feast**: If anything can be considered any sort of sacrament in Pionera's worship, it's the North Star's Feast. Celebrated on a clear night before the start of an expedition, adventurers feast and party joyfully throught the night, while singing praises to the North Star as it's visible in the night sky, and asking for guidance in their upcoming adventure. If the North Star is not visible (for example, of course, if in the Southern hemisphere), a cleric of Pionera instead plants a walking stick on the ground and wraps the top of it in linen and oil and lights it, making a makeshift torch which then symbolizes the North Star.

-**North Star's Grave**: A North Star's grave is a makeshift headstone made for an adventurer who has lost their life during an expedition. The deceased's boots are taken off the corpse, and after the body is buried, they are placed on the head of the grave along with a walking stick propping them up, and the top of the walking stick is adorned with a charm or carved symbol of the North Star. Eventually, the elements end up destroying the headstone, but it's the thought that counts. However, any stranger who happens upon the grave and steals the boots or walking stick is in for a RUDE awakening, as they are often stricken with horrendous misfortune until the stolen items are replaced.

-----

**Tenets**:

-Go forth into the unknown. All things deserve to be discovered, so as their glory may be appreciated.

-Share your knowledge freely. Every skill you teach brings strength and joy, and every new wonder you behold becomes your legacy when you record it for future generations.

-Be kind and loyal to your travel companions. They are your strength as you are theirs, and triumph is so much sweeter if it is shared.

-Record all you learn. Future generations depend on your actions in the present. Tomorrow's explorers will continue the paths you open today.

-Be dilligent. Take care of yourself and your belongings. You can only be daring if your gear is good, your boots sturdy and your walking stick solid.

-Endure. A new path is always full of roadblocks. It is up to you to stomp them down and make way. You can only be daring if you're willing to take risks.

-Be smart. Always have a plan, look for solutions and new points of view. You can only be daring if you calculate your risks.

-----

**Sects and Cults**:

-**Stepping Stones**: Stepping Stones are members of Pionera's church who have settled down and assist other adventurers through various trades. While the term may sound a little degrading to non-believers, Stepping Stones play an essential part in the church's adventuring, and the few clerics that serve as active clergy and maintain the North Star's shrines and temples are Stepping Stones.

-**Recorders**: Recorders are exactly that: those members of the church that dedicate themselves to putting all new knowledge on paper. They usually work inside an adventurers guild's library, providing adventurers with information and maps and receiving new information from them in turn. Recorders also provide tue church with one of its most reliable sources of income: they publish many books such as map books, travel guides and nature journals which are in high demand among myriad other industries. Among the church's field adventurers, Bards are the overwhelming majority of Recorders.

-**The Big Sticks**: The Big Sticks are those followers of the North Star who specialize in combat. While other members of the church handle the information gathering and planning of expeditions, Big Sticks are the ones ready to beat any incoming threat on the head with, well, their big sticks.

-----

**Allies and enemies**:

Pionera has few enemies, and gets along well, or at least civilly, with practically all Good and Neutral deities. She's indifferent to most Evil deities as long as they don't actually oppose the cause of exploration.

Pionera has much respect for Pelor, Lathander and Selûne. As deities of the sun and moon, they provide the light needed for exploration, and also serve as guiding deities. As the deity of the North Star, Pionera see Selûne as a big sister of sorts, and Selûne in term has fondness for Pionera's love of secrets.

Sune, Tymora and Waukeen are fond of Pionera for the indirect services her church does for their causes. Sune appreciates how Pionera's faithful reveal the beauty of new places and things they discover, Waukeen appreciates how every new discovery opens new resources and paths of commerce and trade, and Tymora appreciates that pretty much every adventurer that embarks on an expedition in Pionera's name also does a quick prayer to Tymora for a little luck.

Pionera is fond of Ehlonna and Mielikki for allowing her to explore their forests and for being the nature goddesses most amicable to her faith, and they in turn appreciate how the North Star's followers appreciate their habitat's beauty and are helpful and friendly to those that inhabit it.

Pionera gets along well with Moradin and Gond for the valuable services they provide her by smithing and crafting, and they in turn appreciate her patronage. Moradin in particular also has fondness for Pionera for her role as pathfinder: many a dwarf expedition into the depths of the earth and the Underdark has been assisted by followers of the North Star.

Of all the deities, Pionera has the most fondness for Oghma, Fharlanghn and Shaundakul, and followers of the North Star who worship multiple gods follow those three most often. Oghma is ever-welcoming of Pionera and her faithful, eagerly receiving every new piece of knowledge she brings him, and she in turn is always thankful for all the valuable information he provides for her before each new adventure. With each new discovery, Pionera's faithful light the fire of inspiration in others, leading to new and wonderful ideas that are pleasing to Oghma.They consider themselves fast friends, as do the members of both churches.

Fharlanghn and Pionera are seen as two sides of the same coin. Every new path Pionera opens is turned into a new road by Fharlanghn, and every road he builds in turn eventually ends in a new unknown ripe for Pionera to explore. They love each other as siblings.

Of all the gods, Pionera loves Shaundakul most deeply. The Helping Hand lives up to his name when Pionera is concerned. Members of both churches travel together more than any other, to the point it becomes almost indistinguishable where her church ends and Shaundakul's begins. Even Shaundakul's Chaotic evil servants reign in their excesses and behave when traveling with a follower of the North Star. Whenever a new unknown is so formidable that even Pionera faces difficulty, Shaundakul will appear to serve as a guide for her. Rumors among both churches is that Pionera and Shaundakul are lovers, but the truth of the matter has never been confirmed on either end. The bond between both gods, however, is undeniable.

Vecna and Shar despise Pionera for revealing secrets and sharing knowledge, which they consider a personal insult. Shar particularly hates Pionera cause Selûne is one of her allies, and Vecna is envious of the fact that Pionera's faithful are welcome in Sigil. Many an expedition has been wiped out by cultists of both gods who want to teach the North Star's faithful to not stick their nose where it does not belong.

Talos and Umberlee delight in using their power over storms and the sea to destroy any expedition followers of the North Star embark in. While Pionera doesn't directly oppose them, she is distressed by the pettiness of their hate.

Lolth hates Pionera like she hates any other deity whose followers are willing to explore the Underdark, which she sees as her personal domain, as well as for her allegiance with Moradin.

The most complicated relationships Pionera has are with Obad-Hai, Silvanus, Corellon Larethian, Uthgar, Olidammara and Asmodeus. Obad-Hai, Silvanus and Corellon Larethian often conflict with Pionera because her exploration often ventures into wild places. These gods fear that these incursions into nature expose it to civilization, putting it in danger. Many an expedition of the North Star has been held back by elves and druids who've held them at arrowpoint. Pionera counters that her followers do not despoil nature and appreciate its beauty as much as the other gods do, which is true, but they remain unconvinced. As such, elves and druids rarely follow or adventure with groups of followers of the North Star.

Uthgar, similarly to Obad-Hai, Silvanus and Corellon Larethian, also resents Pionera's faithful encroaching into barbarian lands, wanting to keep civilization away from the purity of his people. However, not a few barbarians are actually attracted to the promises of adventure and travel to wondrous new lands that Pionera's worship offers, and take to adventuring in her name with surprising ease. As such, simultaneous worship of both gods is more common than one may think, and Uthgar begrudgingly permits it, grumbling and moaning the entire time.

Olidammara loves Pionera's adventurous streak and love of secrets, and constantly tries too woo her, but she finds him too boorish even for her, and his extreme selfishness and willingness to stab people in the back disgusts her. This doesn't stop him from trying, and there's some overlap in worship of both gods, but Pionera suggests caution in dealing with Olidammara's worshippers, preferably the use of a walking stick across their teeth.

Probably no god frustrates Pionera as much as Asmodeus. Asmodeus is her polar opposite alignment-wise, of course, so she feels compelled to oppose him, but Asmodeus finds Pionera's followers to be immensely useful to him. Many an expedition of followers of the North Star has been launched by a servant of Asmodeus spreading rumors and giving funding, as well as joining expeditions themselves. Once the expedition makes new discoveries, the servants of Hell will gladly slaughter everyone involved when convenient and keep all the good stuff for their infernal master. Asmodeus has also sent explorers into areas that, unknown to them but known to him, are lairs for the forces of the Abyss. Many a demonic nest has been destroyed by followers of the North Star unknowingly led there by Asmodeus. Sometimes, an expedition with servants of Asmodeus might even go exactly as planned, with the fiend's worshippers going their own way afterwards and, if their allegiance is discovered, leaving the North Star's people dumbfounded. As such, Asmodeus has never ordered any direct action against Pionera, and has even funded her church multiple times, frustrating her to no end.

And there you go, guys, Pionera, Goddess of Discovery. Hope you enjoyed it, and as always, please let me know what you think! ^_^",1,"Pionera, The North Star"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,71,818,"Your characters find a single *sending stone* that radiates divination magic but doesn’t seem to work as they’d expect. While the wizard is examining the stone a burst of static erupts from it, followed by an unfamiliar voice:

“A band of adventures that people are calling Gundren’s Lackies drove the Redbands out of Phandalin earlier today. Villagers are celebrating, but our next guest claims that the Redbrands were the only thing standing between Phandalin and the Cragmaw Goblins. We caught up with Glasstaff the Redbrand leader outside of town, and here’s what he told our bard on the scene...”

Add a little color and world-spanning culture to your fantasy game by introducing a magic radio station! What can a radio station do for your game?

* Connect your major NPCs with a common thread of culture and information. 

* Share rumors with your characters, particularly as their activities begin to affect the wider world around them — what happened in that town after the party burned it down? Who settled in the dungeon they cleared out last week?

* Drive your characters crazy with rumors and innuendo about their party. The media cares more about a sensational story than merely telling the “truth”. Murder hobos should expect to get pretty bad press, but even good guys can have their words and actions twisted.

* Create an opportunity for your characters to “call in” to the station and debate with the bad guys on the air.

* Your bard can write music, file news stories, or share travel logs from their adventures.

* Flesh out major NPCs by telling stories about their recent off-screen activities.

* Share quests, bounties, and other help-wanted opportunities with the party. Of course, rival adventurers will hear the same offers.

* Interviews with gods, icons, faction leaders, archmages, high clerics, generals, pirate captains, etc. And of course they’ll take questions from listeners.

* How’s the war going? What are the factions up to? What new song is taking the realm by storm? Who won the election? Who got assassinated? Who saved the orphanage? 

Here are some elements you can use to give substance to your radio station.

* *Disc jockey* -- Your radio station needs a primary DJ to give it a voice and personality. Your DJ could be a bard, a demigod of information, a fae, a devil, an angel... no wait, *devil* is obviously the right answer. Slick talker, tells the technical truth, and subverts every word to its own end. Perfect! As a purveyor of information the DJ will be alternately loved and hated by your characters, but so distant that he is untouchable even as they grow in power.

* *Station name* -- After you have a DJ you need a name for your station and/or program that reflects its essential nature. It can be as simple and boring as “Realm Radio”, but I suggest a bit more flair. “Welcome back to Zone of Truth, with your host BB Zitherax, and this morning that stands for ‘brass balls’ because I’m here live with Grand Sultan Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan...”. 

* *Agenda* -- What’s the station’s mission in the world? What is it trying to accomplish? Maybe this won’t be obvious to the characters at first, but it will be revealed over time. A good-aligned station would be really boring, so neutral or evil are probably the way to go. Is the station in cahoots with the Big Bad, or is it a disruptor that just likes to stir the pot? If the station has an agenda of its own, then sometimes that might line up with the characters and sometimes not.

* *Reporters* -- For big stories the station will send a bard right to the scene to gather first-hand information. This reporter can serve as a physical presence for the station, whose DJ is remote and untouchable. Use any journalist personality trope you prefer. The reporter can interview the characters, their enemies, and bystanders; write songs about the events; and even pass secrets to the party under the right circumstances. Give the reporter a sort of neutrality/immunity that lets them go anywhere and talk with anyone/anything without being attacked.

* *Audience* -- Who listens to the radio? Maybe only the most powerful NPCs have access to the station, which can create a thread of common knowledge and culture among far-flung characters. They all know the same news stories, the same celebrities, the same songs, etc. The flaws and failures (and triumphs?) of the party get shared with everyone who matters. Or maybe every village has a sending stone they gather around in the evenings. 

* *Celebrities* -- Once you have mass media you can have celebrities: people who are famous for reasons other than their power in the world. Bards, actors, chefs, writers, journalists... adventurers! You get fame-seekers, like Gilderoy Lockhart. You get groupies, fan clubs, paparazzi, gossip rags, public relations, actual plays, and heiresses. Your characters will love to hate all these things.

* *Location* -- Where is your station based out of? I suggest that it should be essentially unreachable, so that even the most powerful NPCs can’t conquer or destroy it. The station will be much more interesting if it can’t be strong-armed by anyone. The location could be secret, or on a hard-to-reach plane, or under the protection of a powerful being.

* *Money* -- The station could hold pledge drives, have advertisements, sell swag, require a subscription, or have high-powered benefactors. It could host charity events, giving characters a opportunity to spend some gold “for a good cause”.

These are just a few ideas for how to use a *sending stone* radio station in your campaign. What do you think? Share some more ideas in the comments.",1,*Sending stone* radio station
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,3,32,"Here's my next entry into the Codex of The Gods! This time, I'm filling a niche I believe is VERY neglected in D&amp;D: children. Pretty much any child that appears in a D&amp;D campaign is just background filler, and most adventurers possibly won't even SEE a child during their campaign, let alone talk to them or interact with them in any meaningful manner. I also thought that it'd be an interesting turn for worshippers of a god to treat that god not as a parent, but as a child.

And thus, I give you: **Nignadora, Goddess of Children** :)

-----

**Name**: Nignadora (Pronounced Nee-Gna-DOH-Rah)

**Titles**: The Child Goddess, Our Precious Child, Firstborn Daughter of All, Our Heavenly Sister

**Divine rank**: Intermediate God

**Position**: Goddess of children and childhood innocence

**Holy symbol**: A silver baby's cradle

**Alignment**: Neutral Good

**Cleric alignments**: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, True Neutral

**Portfolio**: Children and their protection, innocence, education, joy, family, hope for the future

**Domains**: Good, Community, Family, Hope

**Allies**: All Good gods, Neutral gods who protect children

**Enemies**: All Evil gods and beings

**Favored weapon**: Longsword, mace (she gives her favor to these weapons for her servants, but she herself does not wield any weapons)

-----

**Appearance**:

Nignadora's true form, if she has one, is unknown, and being born from the entirety of the universe, she possibly doesn't have a natural form that mortals are able to comprehend. When she manifests to anyone, she appears as an impossibly beautiful female child of the witness's race. Her face is always radiant and with the serenity of the truly innocent, but she also has an air of wisdom far beyond her apparent age. She dresses in flowing silk robes that constantpy change color but are always vibrant and seem to float in the air, and has a crown of flowers that continuously blooms. She always has an item with her that's associated with childhood (a doll, a picture book, a baked sweet). The air around her always smells of recently baked sweets, fragrant flowers and ripe fruits, and people in her presence always feel immensely at peace and a desire to hug and protect her, which she always gladly obliges. Anyone who abuses children is immediately stricken with intolerable guilt and grief when in her presence, and they end up curled up in fetal position crying and begging for forgiveness.

-----

**Backstory** :

Nignadora, Goddess of Children, is one of the most beloved of the Good deities. The Child Goddess is, in an interesting paradox, both one of the oldest beings in existence yet also ""younger"" than all the gods. Even gods that were born millenia after her treat her as a child, and even her worshippers don't love her as a parent like they do other gods, but as a child that blesses them with her greatness, thus her title of Our Precious Child.

According to her doctrine, Nignadora was born from the entirety of existence. When the gods created the universe, the universe in turn birthed her as its first creation, thus her other title of Firstborn Daughter of All. She embodies childhood innocence, and the powerful bonds of parent and child, which she states are an essential part of mortal society.

Since her birth, Nignadora has become the fierce protector of all children of the sentient races, and even races considered ""evil"" but which have maternal cultures pray to her for their children's safety and success. She in turn grants blessings of good health, healthy growth, intelligence and good nature to their children.

-----

**Dogma, clergy and temples**:

Nignadora's worship is widespread across practically all cultures, races and social castes. Nobles pray to her for their children's success in life, while the common folk pray to her for their children's health and for opportunities for them to live better lives than their parents. The Child Goddess in turn loves all peoples, with only the abuse, neglect or exploitation of children being capable of making her retract her favor and bringing forth her wrath. The church does not actively evangelize: they prefer actions to words, and gain converts through service and contributions to society. This attitude actually makes the church quite widespread: her doctrine is one of common sense, familial love and generosity, attitudes that all can appreciate and embrqce easily.

The Child Goddess is often a ""child's first god"", with parents teaching their children to pray to her along with other gods the family worships, but identifying her specifically as theirs. Many children grow up venerating Our Heavenly Sister, and continue to honor her by teaching her worship to their children once they come of age and start a family. It is not uncommon for a family to worship different gods across generations but to always honor Nignadora. Adult worshippers of Nignadora wear a silver pendant of a baby's cradle, their goddess's holy symbol, to show their allegiance to her church. Children do not wear any symbols, since they're Nignadora's by default. While a healthy childbirth and parenthood are the purview of other gods and goddesses, once the child is born, it is then consecrated to Nignadora. A priest is called, who first thanks other gods for blessing the parents with a healthy birth, and then the priest welcomes the child as a new son/daughter of the world, claiming him in Nignadora's name.

Among themselves, members of the church adress themselves as ""brother/sister"". Members of the clergy as a whole are called Shields Protector, so named for their oaths to protect all faithful and especially children. Clerics, paladins and priests are adressed as ""Father/Mother"" by children and ""Honored Brother/Sister"" by adults. Clergy adress children as ""beloved child"" and adults as ""brother/sister"".

Clerics, paladins and priests of Nignadora dress in colorful robes and tabards of either one intense or many varied colors, but with no particular color favored. However, even with no set color, Nignadora's clergy is easily identifiable: their robes and tabards are always covered in handprints of children, who have their hands covered in paint to press them to the fabric. This gives the impression of said robes and tabards being the walls of nurseries or schoolhouses. Nignadora's clergy are always infinitely kind and loving to children, and treat adults with courtesy and fraternal demeanor. They are quite cheerful and pleasant to be around, but can be absolutely frightening in their ruthlessness when a child is victimized, which is the one unforgivable crime in their church. The church's clergy are allowed to marry and have children, and many clerics and paladins of the church come from long lineages of holy warriors who raise their children to be protectors of the faithful.

One of the church's holy tenets is ""No child is an orphan"". As such, although one might expect it to be so, there are no orphanages in settlements where Nignadora is worshipped. A child who has no parents is immediately rescued by the church, and adoptive parents quickly found for him, a process that never takes more than a couple of weeks. However, it's also not uncommon that the child themself asks the church to adopt them, and the church happily accepts them as its own. A child so adopted is welcomed and honored by the community as a whole, as they are considered to be hand-picked by Nignadora herself. Many of the church's children have grown up to be high members of its clergy, and those who choose the path of a cleric or paladin are some of the church's most acclaimed heroes.

Nignadora's temples are entirely functional affairs. Other than a small shrine in a back room for worship, the building does not have any sort of religious trappings beyond her symbol over the entrance. Nignadora's temples are centers for the development of children: nurseries, playgrounds, schoolhouses, children's hospitals, shelters and social centers. In turn, her clergy act as caretakers, playmates, teachers, healers and protectors within the temples. There is always at least one member of the clergy (called the Fellow Father/Mother Superior) who resides permanently within a temple, and is willing to welcome a child and their family at any hour of the day if they're in need. While their functions are strictly peaceful, all temples of Nignadora can be easily fortified at a moment's notice, so as to serve as shelter in case of emergencies. If a child and their family seek sanctuary against persecution or a siege is happening, the temple is sealed to protect them, and clerics and paladins will stand guard at the entrance ready to give their lives for every child inside.

Mass is not a common thing in Nignadora's church. Most worship of the Child Goddess is a personal affair or at most done as a family. However, there are certain important dates in the church's calendar that do merit a mass congregation of the faithful.

The Child Goddess's clerics and paladins are known for two things: infinite kindness towards everyone and infinite brutality against those who hurt children. Evil beings that threaten others are given no quarter by the Shields Protector, and even a regular person who abuses their child can expect a merciless beating and public shaming to make an example out of them. The church is a forgiving church, however, and a child abuser who does contrition and shows legitimate remorse will eventually be welcomed back into the fold. Shields Protector are not extremists, however: if a parent is merely spanking a naughty child or disciplining them, they recognize that it's their duty as parents and will not interfere. Exploitation (especially of a sexual nature) or murder of a child, however, are absolutely unforgivable and punished by death, and curses are thrown over the criminal's corpse so they suffer in the afterlife for their crime.

**Holy days, celebrations and rituals**:

Nignadora's faith has several holy days and celebrations. For the most part, these are joyous affairs, with a couple of exceptions, and celebrate various benchmarks in a child's life.

-**Holy Birth Day**: Celebrated in the first day of spring, Holy Birth Day celebrates the day of Nignadora's birth. It is a joyous festival in which all temples of Nignadora are fully open to the public. A mass is held at the beginning of the day, with joyful hymns sung and cheers from the faithful congratulating Nignadora for her birth. Feasts are held, music and entertainment are performed and gifts and candy are given to children. This day is particularly joyful when a birth coincides with it. Children born on Holy Birth Day are called Heavenly Twins, and are consecrated to Nignadora as twin siblings of hers. Most Heavenly Twins grow up to be clerics or paladins of the Child Goddess's church, seeing their auspicious birth as a call to serve her.

-**First Day of School**: The first day of school each year is celebrated as well. Worshippers of the Child Goddess donate school supplies to the church, and gift children with uniforms and books. Children who first reach school age are welcomed into their new school, and those who start their last year of schooling are given a ceremony in which they are annointed and blessed as they near adulthood.

-**Coming of age**: The birthday of a teen that reaches adulthood is a solemn affair. A feast is held for the new adult, in which a priest of Nignadora blesses the new adult and gifts them the silver cradle pendant, symbolizing his entrance into adulthood. The new adult then does a prayer swearing to love their new child Nignadora, who now goes from being their sister to being their daughter.

-**Parent's Day**: Parent's Day is a festival in which children honor their parents. Children go to Nignadora's temples, and are helped by the clergy in creating handmade gifts for their parents. The parents receive the gifts and thank Nignadora for blessing them with loving children.

-**Day of Shields Protector**: One of the most important days within the church's calendar, the Day of Shields Protector is held on the first day of winter. This is the day in which new members of the clergy are inaugurated into the ranks. Clerics, paladins and priests perform oaths according to their position, and children cover their hands in paint and press them to their tabards and robes, identifying them to the world as sworn Shields Protector. Each new member of the clergy is invited, along with their family, into another family's home, where they are given a feast and given gifts as thanks for their new role. Depending on the family's resources, it is not uncommon for a cleric or paladin to receive a weapon or a horse as a gift, but any gift given is usually something functional and useful to the Shield Protector's new role, and are accepted humbly and gratefully. After the festivities, the new clergy meet at one of Nignadora's temples to pray in silence through the night, ready to start their new lives in the morning.

-**Day of Infinite Tears**: An important day in the church, but one people hope never comes to pass, a Day of Infinite Tears is called when a child dies. A priest of Nignadora performs funeral rites and holds mass, and all worshippers of the Child Goddess congregate to mourn the deceased. The child's casket is put on an easy to pull cart, and their fellow children pull the cart towards the body's place of eternal rest, while the adults all cry for the deceased child as if they had lost one of their own. Any paladins and clerics of Nignadora who are in the vicinity when a Day of Infinite Tears is called waits at the cemetery, and hold their swords and clubs as an arch for the child's body to pass under. After the ceremony is finished, families go to their homes, perform a prayer for the deceased child's soul and hug their children a little tighter than usual that night

-**Avengeance of The Child**: The most dreaded event the church can call, the Avengeance of The Child is a call to action when children have been abused on a grand scale. This usually happens when a group is discovered to systematically abuse children for gain, such as through slavery, child trafficking and/or sacrifice. This is, more than anything else, a military affair: warriors are summoned, plans made and war is fought. Unless something more urgent keeps them from making it (a very rare occurrence), every martial Shield Protector available will congregate to join the avenging army. This army can be more diverse than what one might initially think: fellow adventurers who've befriended the Shields Protector and warriors of other gods or nations friendly to the Child Goddess's cause may join in as well. A group of child abusers who expect a small group of priests might be horrified to see a regiment hundreds or thousands strong filled with fighters, rangers, magic users and holy men from multiple faiths ready to rain holy vengeance upon them.

-----

**Tenets**:

-Children are our most valued gift. Protect them, teach them well and raise them into good adults.

-No child is an orphan. Find a parentless child a new home, or embrace him as a child of the church. No child shall grow alone and unloved.

-Honor parents and help them when they need it. A happy parent makes for a happy child, and a parent in need has a child in need. Help them get work and education, and provide charity and succor.

-Accept all as brothers and sisters. Only those who victimize children are unworthy of your love.

-Punish all who abuse children, destroy those who victimize them. Fight the forces of Evil whenever they surface.

-Honor those of other faiths who heed Our Precious Child's teachings. They are our brothers and sisters.

-----

**Sects and Cults**:

-**The Wise Brothers/Sisters**: Wise Brothers and Sisters are clergy members who dedicate themselves to teaching. They run the church's schoolhouses, and also offer teaching to unlearned adults who want to improve their lot. Many have connections to higher centers of learning, and a child who is taught in a school run by the Child Goddess's church is a good prospect for a successful career.

-**The Heralds of The Child**: Heralds are liaisons between the church and local governments. They negotiate with governments for funds and cooperation for the church's causes, and assist authorities in bureocratic processes that involve children, such as adoptions, legislation that favors children and enforcement of the law. Clerics and paladins of the church often serve as local law enforcement as members of the Heralds, but only when it's in the service of general good and protection of children. A government that tries to take advantage of the Heralds for their own gain will immediately make fierce enemies.

-**The Innocent**: The Innocent are the church's warriors, composed of those clerics and paladins who proactively hunt down enemies of the church. They are the members of the church most likely to join adventuring parties, and often serve as knights errant.

-----

**Allies and enemies**:

Nignadora gets along well with all Good and most Neutral gods, and especially gets along with gods of motherhood and family, whom she sees as loving parents. All churches of the parent gods of the racial pantheons that are not Evil (Bahamut, Corellon Larethian, Eilistraee, Moradin, Garl Glittergold, Yondalla, etc.) tend to honor Nignadora also, as well as those of gods of the common folk, protection, the arts and general charity (Pelor, Ilmater, Lathander, Sune, Torm, Tyr). In turn, many worshippers of Nignadora also worship other gods. Nignadora is not a jealous goddess, she believes there's enough love to go around for everyone.

Nignadora does not hate any god, but she does not condone the actions of Evil gods or those that turn a blind eye to child abuse, and as such, has earned the enmity of many an Evil deity.

And there you go, guys, Nignadora, The Child Goddess. Hope you enjoyed it :)",1,"Nignadora, The Child Goddess"
self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,9,451,"&gt;*""Nobody knows where Leon came from. He just shows up every couple of weeks at The Unicorn."" Andres Tallcrag, the barkeep, will admit that Leon tips fairly well, and his conversations seem normal. The dwarf patron is fairly eloquent for his race, but he doesn't drink much. ""Eh, I'm sure Krakendust is more his vice,"" Andres says. ""Leon's polite, and I feel he appreciates the company as much as I do. It's nice to have some normalcy when you live in the Pale District, y'know? His cloak is a bit weird, however. He never takes it off...""*

**Leon Brinwall** is **Alteyr Quintanus**, the High Elf nobleman who resides over the growing riverside city of Elodel. **Leon's Cloak** is enchanted and allows its wearer to assume the form of a nondescript dwarf. The cloak is honestly just a fairly standard wool cloak, dyed black, with small golden threads laced at the fringes, very difficult to see. These threads are what give the cloak its magical properties. Leon frequents a bar, the Unicorn Tavern, in the seedy Pale District of Elodel.

Sometimes the nobility just wants to feel normal again, yknow?  


If the party strikes up conversation with Leon, you can play the situation regardless of if they have interacted with Alteyr.  


If they have not met Alteyr, Leon will be friendly and buy them a mug of whatever ale he's been sipping on. He may tell a story of some rumor about the nobility (which is 100% true, by the way - The Queen does have a thing for being choked), but it's important that you don't give them a single hint that he's Alteyr. This dwarf, to the players eyes, should be just a friendly, well-spoken dwarf in a kinda run-down area. He tells good stories and is a nice dude.  


On the other hand, if the players have met Alteyr, you can play the situation differently depending on how their actions with him have gone in the past.  


If Alteyr and the party did not get along, Leon may be very rude to them, leading Andres Tallcrag, the dwarf bartender, to comment that the outburst is rather unlike Leon's usual demeanor. He may flee the Unicorn Tavern entirely, and Andres will be dumbfounded. Maybe have the cloak lying in the dirt outside a few streets away, or a thread or scrap of the cloak ripped off as he ran away. It could lead to a huge conspiracy faceted around a magic cloak.  


If they helped Alteyr in a time of great need, then Leon will be friendly to them and introduce himself (""Leon Brinwall, cobbler and financier! How has your evening been, gentlemen?"") as normal, but will not buy them a drink. He has already given them enough. His story is entertaining but forgettable.  


If Alteyr is a strong ally to the party, then Leon will be very friendly to the party, buying them food and drink. He will tell a great story about the nobility and rumor onward about something that only your party and Alteyr would know. This is the first clue. He will turn to Andres and explain that your party is a group of his old friends. Leon will ask if they can get a private room to eat and catch up, and he will tell them about the cloak. From here you can turn The Unicorn into a mini-quest hub if Alteyr requires assistance on a smaller scale.   


The goal is to show a high nobleman in a different environment, someone trying to feel a smaller sense of scale for once. Leon should be his charming, lowly alter ego.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,16,73,"# Infestations and Parasites

My biggest fear when tromping through muck is getting a tiny cut and having a worm crawl in. It’s horrific to describe and really freaks people out. Thus, I love putting them in my campaigns.

It DOES require DM ruling on Parasites not being the same as Diseases, lest someone drop a lesser Restoration on that bad boy and ruin your fun.

&gt;*An infestation is a type of disease caused by parasites, rather than the usual forms of bacterial or viral disease, and they require special means to cure.*

I prefer to drop the parasite removal technique into local cities/villages, which means the players have to play diplomat or ask nearby friends how to get treatment. Locals tend to know local parasites. Charging in a’la murderhobo won’t work when you need a big favor.

So! Here’s some bonus worms for making your wild ride *just nasty*

&amp;#x200B;

**Southern Burrowing Worm**

DC 8 - Constitution

If failed, a slender white worm no thicker than a thread races through the water, bites a bit of exposed skin, and burrows into the character’s flesh. It can peirce between dragonborn scale, but cannot infect someone who does not have fleshy organs.

If left untreated, in 1 day the worm will lay eggs in the afflicted person’s flesh, near the site of the bite.

3 days after infection, the baby worms begin to travel through veins to begin growth in the abdomen, and the host takes 1d4 piercing damage.

The character experiences intense itchiness, nausea, fever, and pain centralized around their gut.

From the 4th day onward, each new day the afflicted person takes 2d4 piercing damage, **which increases by 1d4 each new day left untreated.** Vomiting is accompanied by tiny worms in the expunged fluid.

This worm is cured by a carefully measured herbal blend that will force the person to vomit a very unpleasant amount of worms out, but will afterward be cured.

Chopping off the limb our deeply gouging the area of the initial bite will also work.

*Burrowing worms have been known to devour an entire sheep in two weeks. Running its course will leave a corpse behind.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Moonworm**

DC 8 - Constitution

A silvery worm barely longer than a grain of rice.

It’s contracted if you get nasty swamp water in your eyes, and the worm takes advantage to lay eggs in the character’s eyelid. After 1 day left untreated, the eggs hatch, and babies burrow into the eyeball itself.

While infected, the babies multiply rapidly in the eyeball, reducing their vision in 1 eye, and lowering perception by 2.

If left untreated for 10 days, the pressure can become too much, and the infected eye may explode, leaving them permanently blind in one eye.

Before the eggs hatch, they can be washed out with clean water.

After the eggs hatch, the larvae inside can be killed with a twice-daily saline and rare herb solution. For best results, apply cure before 10 days are up.

*On the plus side, before it explodes the pupil is such a pretty silvery color - like the moon!*

&amp;#x200B;

**Boil-Fly**

DC 8 - Constitution

A big, fuzzy brown bee-fly lands on you. There’s no sting - the eggs drop onto skin, and quickly hatch from body heat, and the larvae quickly burrow under the skin - maybe leaving itchiness, but no pain.

Day 1: Under the skin, leaving a reddening welt, is a growing larvae, feeding on tissue

2 days after infection, the victim begins feeling pain at the site of the larvae, can feel a firm cyst underneath the skin, and can see a white-headed pore.

4 days after infection, the victim can begin feeling it move under their skin, and suffers 1d6 psychic damage

10 days after infection, the larvae burrows out of the host, leaving 2d6 psychic damage, and drops to the ground in a hard cocoon to hatch into a new fly.

The main method for removal is surgical - With a sharp, clean knife, cut it out. Luckily these larvae produce antibacterial agents on their own, so the wounds rarely get secondary infections.

*Some people smear a thick layer of fat over the site, then hold raw meat to it for several hours, encouraging the larvae to burrow out to a new, less-smothering home.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Rose Wasp**

DC 10 - Constitution

A dark red Wasp that reaches adulthood among the petals of flowers, but spends its larval stages in the respiratory tract of mammals. Rarely fatal, always gross.

Please don’t stop to smell the roses.

The infection period is only 5 days

Day 1: Person inhales eggs by pushing through a patch of dense flowers carelessly, or by deliberately stopping to smell them.

Day 2: Baby worms feed on lung mucus and membrane, leading to horrible coughs which occasionally produce tiny pink worms. 1d6 piercing damage

Day 4: Infected experiences even worse coughs with spots of blood, and 2d6 peircing damage

Day 5: Infected is bedridden with racking, bloody coughs. 6d6 damage, but all the worms manage to migrate out of the lungs on their own by the morning of Day 7

If you don’t want to wait it out, spending 6 hours on any day before Day 4 smoking heavily can convince the baby worms you’re not inhabitable, and you can cough them out before they begin biting deeply.

*Smoking a pipe before bed has been a local tradition for longer than I remember...*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Other parasites I’d love to include but I can’t think of damage mechanics;**

Tongue-Eating Louse (Cuts off blood supply to your tongue, then becomes your tongue.)

Crab Barnacle (Makes zombie crab. Maybe makes zombie PC)

Land Barnacle (Like a normal barnacle thank god, except on PCs or NPCs with hard shells, scales, or plate armor)

&amp;#x200B;

*(In my defense: My players specifically asked for ""Eldritch terror and body horror"" for their campaign themes. So far the dragonborn contracted the Southern Burrowing Worm, and the whole party was freaked out enough by the description to drop everything and rush to the nearest settlement to get healed ASAP. She'll be fine!)*",1,Infestations and Parasites

**THE TEMPLE OF THE MOON**

*“Look, the job’s not easy. But if it was, we wouldn’t be sending you. These old texts talk about a ‘Temple of the Moon’ from the last age where a hero supposedly left some powerful weapon. I want you to get for me. Now they don’t describe exactly what it is but knowing all your caliber I’m sure it won’t be an issue to retrieving it. It claims the temple only opens during a full moon, so the window until next month is in a few days – don’t get caught in there unless you like dying of hunger, and good luck.”*

Leon’s an old contact but reliable for a good job when he finds one. He’s picked up a charter for you all to travel upriver on a pontoon for a few days before dropping you off and immediately coming back. So, you’ll have to find your own way back or pay the ferryman extra to stay another day.

**Before the Adventure**

Surely someone must know about what this temple is other than Leon and his network of contacts? Turns out a couple students at the arcane school in town have done research on it for their formal projects. They know little more than Leon but understand there’s a lot to do with the phases of the moon and the light projected from them. Maybe players stumble upon two off-duty guards discussing the Armar (Sergeant title) mentioning a snowstorm coming from that direction – odd for this early in the fall but not enough to send out a search party to investigate.

Once they’re ready to set off the party meets with Cho, a half-elf boat captain who ferries the River Raft. His vessel is an old pontoon boat powered by a small water elemental that swims underneath the ship guiding it along. It occasionally shows its head underwater or a tail splash behind the boat. Use the stats of a water weird should they want to attack it or there’s a random encounter.

A day after setting off a heavy fog sets in from upriver. The boat rests about a foot above the calm surface and the fog is there to meet it, but it does not breach the sides. This fog is magical and a set up for the rest of the trip. Players who do actions such as swimming immediately fail a constitution save for inhaling the gas. Ask everyone to make your choice of investigation, perception, or nature check. DC13 will determine where the fog comes from (upriver), that the fog is magical in nature (control elements cast in the snowy region), and it smells like a sweet wild winterberry – so sweet it’s almost *entrancing* you to jump into the much colder water. Anyone who succeeds upon this has willingly exposed themselves to the gas and is now susceptible to hallucinations when they get off the boat. They see more snowmen on the edge of their sight when other members don’t at all, described in the next section.

**Approaching the Temple**

On the morning of the second day, the boat is stopped by large sheets of ice as snow has lightly blanketed the natural greens of the autumn world. Cho knows ice flows tend to pile up in the winter, but this is too early for anything this large building up. Forced to stop and let everyone off. He either bids them a good trip or may be bribed to remain until they return.

Travelling towards the center of the slowly increasing storm, players are subject to seeing snowmen at the edge of their sight range. Unmoving and facing the party. My players took the time arguing about what to do before moving declaring anything, and during that time the image of the snowman morphed to a scarecrow. Whether they choose to interact or completely avoid with it is up to them as it’s just an ordinary scarecrow. This can occur a few more times, after the second they remain as snowmen regardless of players actions. Disturbing the later snowmen reveals frozen bodies under the snow of traveling commoners.  

The closer the party gets to the center of the storm the heavier the snow and wind begin raining down. Anyone not wearing gear to deal with the increasingly cold temperatures must make a constitution save, on the second or third failure they suffer a level of exhaustion. This can be staved off with fire-based spells, warm drinks, or time spent resting out of the winds and snow for a short rest. 

Eventually the flurry will pick up so hard it becomes a struggle to continue. The final stage of illusion sets upon the party. Constitution saves are made as a formality crossing through a near-impassible wall of weather before they breach into the calm eye of the storm that is Evelyn’s Glade. Those who fail are battered with 1d10 of ice damage.

**Evelyn’s Glade**

Evelyn is a Bheur Hag who has taken residence inside a shack above the Temple of the Moon. She took pity to a Lycan by the name of Halamar, for he despised his existence and promised a future of servitude to her in exchange for a cure. Rituals brought them here, where each trial was a toll on his body. Forcing her to keep him in the temple as curious adventurers might stumble upon them and she can’t maintain his illusion. As a result, he’s permanently kept in Lycan form and suffers disadvantage outside of the near-full moon days.

Knowing of the coming super full moon this evening, she is currently disguised as a drow and is aware of the party’s presence. A mass illusion over the clearing shows a small cottage with a few trees and a nearby cellar. She currently chops firewood and prepares for an evening stew. Evelyn will openly converse with the party, regularly mistake details but state them with a confidence that doesn’t reveal much with an insight check other than the discrepancies in story. Information about her past conflicts with itself, her reasoning for being in the forest isn’t very backed up, she apologies for creating such a storm with recent weather rituals. 

Her temperament is a forgiving one, but high insight checks will reveal a bubbling sense of hunger. Evelyn is a glutton and feasts upon intruders. Although good hearted in action when exchanging deals to those she’s met over the ages, being demanded around snaps her otherwise stalwart disguise.

She welcomes them to a short rest to enjoy stew and adamantly denies any existence of a temple, refusing entry to her simply locked cellar. Should the players continually antagonize her, enter the cellar, or disrupt her daily routine her temper loses and casts them out. Any further denial of her request and her true form of a Bheur Hag is revealed in a rage. The illusion of the peaceful meadow drops to a graveyard of corpses strung like drying meat for her to use the Maddening Feast ability. Should the players consume her stew they now realize they’ve indulged in the taste of humanoid flesh. 

Should Evelyn drop below 50% HP she will blow a horn of silent alarm, alerting Halamar that she is fighting and dying – that the next person to open the doors of the temple room he’s in will most likely look to kill him, unless it’s blown to him again.

The cellar of the cottage is uninteresting for regular items except for a large set of stone doors leading to the temple. If Evelyn is dead and the party rests inside the cellar, then decide to exit again, they notice the storm dying down enough to see snowmen surrounding the glade. These are a combination of frozen corpses and regular scarecrows. Toss in a few sentient ones for the curious adventurer. 

**THE TEMPLE**

Crack back the large stone doors of the temple and prepare for a contained dungeon. The first step is to descend a spiral staircase with a hollowed-out center for a 140ft downwards climb before a 60ft tunnel that leads to the main atrium.

*Peering into this octagonal atrium you discover a mysterious sight: In the center rests a large device of gilded wood in the shape of a Y, much like clock hands, pointing to basins that rest in a set of 8. Below these is a large mural of astrological phenomena and 8 faintly glowing runes representing the various phases of the moon. Behind all of this on each wall is a set of smooth stone doors with no clear indications of opening mechanism. \[Image on the document\]*

Of the basins, 3 are currently open, which are the ones the hands point to. A quick walk around and each party member can determine that #8 has rotten food, #3 with holy water, and #5 with solid ice \[the insides can be changed, their contents for all basins do not matter other than a deterrent\]. Inside the frozen ice and holy water, a pull handle can be seen, but the arm must be fully submerged to reach it. See “When pulling levers” for the quick explanation on how they work.

The final goal of the dungeon is to have doors 7, 4, and 3 open. Clues throughout the rooms and the eventual use of the 6th will let players unlock the proper combination. It will not open unless room 6 is completed.

The phases of the moon light up with a light yellow \[or color of your moon's reflection\] when the door is opened.

The basins will refill if emptied after being closed. Its contents, regardless of nature, will deteriorate in 5 minutes after being removed from the basin to prevent collection outside the temple.

**When Pulling Levers**

· Only 3 levers will ever be exposed at a time due to the nature of the mechanism closing basins when hands are not pointed at it.

· Rooms cannot be opened from the inside.

· Pulling a lever with a small hand pointing towards it opens the large hand. When pulling the large hand, it opens both small hands. Pulling a lever again shuts the door(s) that it would open. Pulling all three at once does not change these rules.

· If a material is hazardous a player must take a DC save reaching in or suffer some consequence unless they have a reasonable way to negate it. A crowbar can pull hot oil without burning the player but cannot faire the temperature of molten silver \[probably? Science\]. Rotten food requires a constitution save if the player has taken damage to resist a disease from open wounds. Use your own judgement.

**The Rooms**

1) This room is an average storage closet for dried herbs and other medicinal materials. Players can spend time gathering common ingredients like bloodgrass, emetic wax, scilia beans, honeyroot, and others for use in brewing potions or fashion into healing kits or a poison should they know how.

2) This room is dimly lit by a single candle. However, this candle is behind a hall of dozens of glass mirrors creating an infinity maze. Walking in is so disorientating that a DC25 investigation is needed to stay on track. Otherwise the players can use shatter or start smashing to make their way towards the candle. Breaking the mirrors releases a Susurrus from the shards that hunts the players. At the base of the candle is a black orb. This orb is used in room 6 to unlock the doors that need to be open and solve the puzzle.

3) It’s oily, slimy, greasy, and it’s pitch black beyond anything but Truesight. The room itself is shaped like a shallow skateboard bowl and players immediately slip with a DC24 dex save. Inside, a Specter asks for secrets from the player while gently caressing them. It knows if there’s a lie but as a dm, things that seem like the player would have as a secret from backstory or certain circumstances will do. If answered, he will give them a small black orb and ask other players if they entered as well. Refusal means attacking. This orb is used in room 6 to unlock the doors that need to be open and solve the puzzle. They will have to get creative to navigate out.

4) A thin glass wall separates the entire room from 24 Mehpits. Devious little creatures of your elemental choosing that swarm along the window and ask for freedom. Of course, doing so will release them and attack the players. Should the players attempt to negotiate with them not to attack and instead release information, treat each half as two opposite viewpoints. One dozen with a +7 to resisting negotiation and the other -7. Inside their room is slashes marking the shape of a Y that matches the pattern of the temple code but flipped horizontally.

5) This room is split 50/50 by a light coming from the ceiling. One side dark and the other in relatively pale white. Inside a host of items are scattered everywhere. The contents or what the room is doesn’t matter. Every item inside is either chrome plated or wood, and players must spend the better half of half an hour organizing everything with chrome in the light, wood in the dark, to unlock a secret compartment in the middle of the floor. Inside is a trove of gold coins or other loot. Other players can take a short rest during this time.

6) The circular room is flat on all sides with a ceiling that seems to extend forever. In reality, the ceiling is just out of sight and is enchanted to be hard to see. When bringing the black orbs into the room they begin to glow ever so faintly. There’s a series of 8 pockets in the ceiling to fit the 3 orbs that signal the door. Describe the trial and error of players placing orbs into slots to see which pocket lights up when an orb is placed in it. They can’t solve the puzzle without all 3 positions lighting up. Once they are all in place, a small constellation begins to form from light lines that connect the orbs like a Y based on the cardinal direction of 7, 4, and 3 of the main atrium. The main floor doors can be opened to allow finishing the puzzle.

7) The room of the full moon is brightly lit. Each wall is covered top to bottom with 3 bookshelves of books telling stories throughout the ages. Some very recent and others completely forgotten. Most are in languages or dialects that make them hard to read as well. If the players decide on pulling out books or knocking down a shelf, they reveal a large chalk drawing that spans all 3 walls and forms another Y flipped on the vertical axis shaped to the answer formation. 

8) What once might have been a dining room is now simply a stone table covered in bloodied rags and random bandages. Hiding inside is a wounded werewolf (already bloodied) hiding for a surprise attack. Halamar will respond to callouts only after this first strike as he won’t give away his hiding position for a sneak attack on any inquisitive players. He wields a Veteran’s Longsword that is still in the cane form. If given the chance, he will lay down his weapons and attempt to leave as he would rather accept the curse then completely die. In the back of the room is a black orb. This orb is used in room 6 to unlock the doors that need to be open and solve the puzzle.

**Completing the Temple**

Once the orbs are in place inside room 6’s ceiling, the players need to have the 3 doors indicated by their cardinal direction matching. The entire platform begins to descend along with anyone on top of it. Slowly but surely the platform makes its’ way down 400ft into the depths of the ground. Once reaching the bottom a single, regular door remains.

Upon opening the door, a long hallway rolls out for a lengthy 200ft. Braziers of green ignite along both sides of the walkway until eventually lighting a central staircase to a large ornate chest at the top of a small pyramid. The players can now retrieve the item they were sent for.. As soon as this item is picked up, the lights of the room go out. The ceiling is lit up like an endless ocean of stars that give dim light through the room. Constellations that are beyond any written memory rest among this mural right along side those seen in the current sky; guiding the player’s way back to the door, up the slow lift, and eventually out the temple.",1,Temple of the Moon

Jhamas appears as a man dressed in grey robes, with every one of his features wrapped in strips of grey linen. It's impossible to tell which race he belonged to in life, but he is male. His robes feature embroidery and his holy symbol in the back, stitched in dull silver thread. His robes have charms hanging from the sleeves representing suicide methods: a ladder symbolizing jumping from a height, a noose, a razor, a bottle of poison, etc. Upon his head lies a dull grey crown made of unpolished iron.

-----

**Backstory** :

Jhamas is an ascended mortal from a time beyond collected history, and is generally believed to be the first to commit suicide. His life before ascension is unknown, some of his followers theorize even to him, but Jhamas himself states his former life is irrelevant. He is now mainly known as the god of suicide, and few gods take their role as obssessively as him.

According to his followers, Jhamas's suicide, being the first (and thus, a concept that didn't exist beforehand), resulted in his godhood, as in that moment in time he embodied the totality of the concept. Both Jhamas and the other gods were completely taken by surprise: Jhamas because his attempt at ending his existence led to a completely new one and the gods because they did not expect a mortal to ascend. In that time, Jhamas was a wild card among the gods, as he did not find a purpose yet beyond merely existing outside a mortal life, and no god knew what to make of him. The forces of Law saw his suicide as a blatant challenge to the natural order of things, while the forces of Chaos saw it as snuffing the dynamism of life through oblivion. The forces of Good saw his suicide as throwing away the gift of life, while the Evil gods saw it as a cheap way to escape their torments. This ostracism by the other gods is what earned Jhamas one of his sobriquets, The Lonely God.

Centuries later, a plague ravaged the Material Plane, its origin unknown to this day. The plague was disfiguring, causing both physical suffering and social ostracism. The poor classes were particularly affected, with nobles and many clergy forsaking the diseased as below their concern or as being punished by the gods. This eventually led to the first suicides beyond The First, and the gods once again convened. This time, the gods came to a concensus: taking one's own life was both a Chaotic and an Evil act, seeing the suffering it left behind among the berieved and the squandering of the gift of life. As such, the souls of those committing suicide were condemned to the Abyss.

Jhamas confronted the gods, demanding the souls of the other suicides for his own, wanting to spare them the tortures of the Abyss. ""They squandered the gift of life"", the Good gods said. ""How can life be a gift when it brings such suffering?"", Jhamas retorted. ""They violate the natural order of life"", the Lawful gods claimed. ""What order is there in the life they escaped? It is chaos, uncertainty and suffering!"", Jhamas screamed.

The Lonely God, outraged at the other gods for their lack of mercy, went to the gods of death and pleaded his case. Jhamas claimed that those who died by taking their own life were his by right, being The First, and that punishing souls trying to escape suffering by making their suffering be eternal was cruel irony. The gods of death saw sense in Jhamas's claim, but they foresaw that stating outright that the souls of those who took their life belonged to him would cause conflict among the other gods. Thus, the gods of death reached a compromise with Jhamas: he could not claim the souls of those who took their own lives outright, but were he to take those souls before the Abyss would take them or if those souls were to dedicate themselves to him, they would not oppose him.

With this promise from the gods of death, for the first time in his existence, Jhamas had found a purpose: he would create a church that would save the souls of those who took their own life.

Upon ascending to godhood, Jhamas managed to secure a small plane for himself, which he baptized with the name of Camposantus. It is a desert realm, but there is no heat or cold. The air is perfectly still, and both the sky and the landscape are varying shades of grey. Within this realm, the souls claimed by Jhamas are held in monoliths of grey moonstone crystal, not conscious but held in perfect serenity and eternal rest. Even within his realm, surrounded by the souls he rescues, Jhamas is alone.

-----

**Dogma, clergy, temples and holy days**:

Jhamas is a god intimately attuned to mortal suffering. As such, he preaches that suicide is not a sin, but a final escape from a life of misery. The holiest sacramentsof his church is tending the funeral rites of those who commited suicide, so as to give comfort to the families, and assisting the suicide of those whose suffering has made their life unbearable. These rites also mark the souls of the deceased, so that Jhamas can claim them before they fall into the Abyss. Worshippers of Jhamas who pray to him before taking their life also have their souls marked for his rescue. For these purposes, Jhamas's clergy carry funeral tools, like linen bandages and embalming implements, to consecrate the body of the deceased.

However, as paradoxical as it may seem, Jhamas also demands from his followers succor towards the less fortunate. The Lonely God does not promote suicide as the only solution, only the final one. If it were in Jhamas's power, he'd eliminate mortal suffering altogether so suicide can never be considered as an option. Many enemies of the Lonely God's church demonize it as a death cult, but those who are introduced to his faith through succor or ministry know this is simply untrue. Assisted suicide is a holy practice in Jhamas's church, but only when all other forms of succor have failed the faithful.

Most clerics and priests of Jhamas are failed suicides. In trying to end their own life, they receive visions from the Lonely God, offering them a purpose in life as part of his clergy. Those who refuse are still saved from the Abyss by Jhamas, but those that accept his offer are always miraculously saved at the last second from fully expiring. While their god's purpose might make one assume that his clergy are dour, stoic and humorless, in fact the opposite is true. Jhamas's clergy tend to actually be high-spirited and of sunny disposition. Being given a purpose in life and a second chance, not to mention a guarantee of peaceful rest when death eventually comes, makes Jhamas's priests generally positive in disposition. There are some members of his clergy that do fit the stereotype of a gloomy death priest, but this is more out of fierce devotion than melancholy.

While many well-to-do people consider Jhamas's church eccentric at best and disturbingly morbid at worse, the faith has slowly carved a niche for itself among the lower classes. In particular, the church has received many converts from other faiths that condemn suicide and who've lost loved ones to it. Knowing there is a god who's made it his purpose to make sure their loved ones get eternal rest away from the fires of the Abyss gives these people hope, and the church's universal acceptance of all comers has earned them the esteem of the common folk.

Although not strictly intentional, Jhamas's church has become a beacon of hope among people from oppressed groups, to the point that his portfolio includes the disenfranchised. Jhamas offers his mercy to all people regardless of their status in society, and his clergy have assisted these groups when they are victims of pogroms or fall to despair living under an oppressive society. This makes oppressive governments suspicious of the church's activities, suspecting they might be preaching revolution, but so far none of The First's faithful has actively participated in any rebellion, and Jhamas himself has not shown any support on either side of the argument. Among the oppressed, the title of Our Only Father has come to use to describe Jhamas, being seen by many of them as the one god that doesn't forsake his faithful and gives them a mean to escape the horrors of life.

Established temples for Jhamas are practically non-existent, but groups of his clerics will carry portable shrines and pitch tents for his worship and tending the needy in poor city quarters and areas where suffering is rampant, such as battlefields and plague-ravaged lands. Jhamas's clergy are mostly nomadic, travelling from place to place as they're needed. Any established temple of Jhamas is more often than not a small hut or house donated to the church by a generous member of the faithful.

Jhamas's faith does not have ritual celebrations; the Lonely God's purpose is much too somber for any sort of rejoicing. However, the week of the winter solstice is observed as a time of meeting among the faithful to thank Jhamas for his love. These meetings also serve as days to exchange information, allowing the clergy to learn of places that are in need of their ministry, where the faith has allies and where they're not welcome.

Jhamas's priests generally dress in short grey robes, and wear a pendant with his symbol around their necks. Their dress announces their allegiance to the Lonely God, but it is not meant to show off. It is unobtrusive and functional. Priests usually carry a weapon for self-defense, and often wear at least chain or leather mail under their robes. All clergy of Jhamas alwas carry a consecrated dagger and special poison on their person so as to assist one of the faithful in taking their own life. These items are blessed by Jhamas so as to not cause pain: the dagger cuts without hurting, and the assisted person bleeds out quickly and painlessly, while the poison acts quickly and makes them drift into eternal sleep. These items, quite obviously, can make certain authorities and enemies of the church nervous, so clergy of Jhamas unwelcome in certain lands will wear regular clothing and hide among the common folk.

-----

**Tenets**:

-Suicide is the end of suffering, not the beginning of eternal suffering. Prey to Jhamas, and he will give your soul respite.

-Console the berieved and consecrate the souls of those who've taken their own life. The ending of one's suffering should not bring others' pain.

-Alleviate suffering. Give alms and succor to those less fortunate. If death is the only escape from suffering, assist the faithful in achieving it.

-Bigotry has no place. All mortals suffer the same. Do not deny your mercy to those different than your own.

-Do not become involved in petty politics and mortal schemes. These are distractions from the faith and sources of suffering.

-Shun those who demonize suicide. It is not a sin, but an escape from mortal suffering. One who has died suffers no more.

-The gods of Evil Chaos and the demonic hordes of the Abyss are abominations to Jhamas. Fight their minions and stop their influence whenever you can.

-Go where you're most needed. Suffering is everywhere, so should be the Lonely God's faithful.

**Sects and Cults**:

**The Mercies:**: The Mercies is the term for members of Jhamas's clergy that focus on the church's mission of succor and ministry. They give alms to the poor, run soup kitches and shelters, and minister to the sick. They often work in hospitals and sanitariums when they are welcome there, and they are the members of the church most likely to wear their allegiance openly. They also are the ones who handle funerary rites for those who've taken their lives.

**The Embracers**: The Embracers are the death priests of Jhamas's church, those who assist suicides. They go to the worst areas of the world and, where the Mercies' ministry has not helped, they offer the final alternative. Embracers tend to be stoic and grim, seeing their ministry as the holiest of work and not to be treated casually. Many Embracers perform their duties in secret, as many authorities would not distinguish their work from common murder, and quite often the funeral rites involved are nothing more than praying with the faithful to consecrate their soul for Jhamas's embrace before their life is extinguished, often leaving the body at the mercy of tye elements or the authorities for disposal.

**The Only Sons**: The Only Sons (females are called Only Daughters) are Jhamas's warriors and clerics, who dedicate themselves to destroying Evil in his name. This doesn't usually include human institutions, unless they're specifically preying on Our Only Father's faithful, but is more focused on fighting supernatural threats to the church. They are fervent hunters of demons and the undead, and will often join adventuring parties so as to find allies in their work and have freedom to travel to the places where they're most needed. An Only Son will be the type of worshipper of Jhamas that an adventuring party will meet most often.

**The First Truth**: The First Truth (or Truthers) are a heretical cult within Jhamas's church. According to their heretical beliefs, the First's ascension into godhood reveals a powerful truth: that suicide is a path to divinity. Truthers dedicate themselves to spreading misery in Jhamas's name, so as to incite mass suicide among the faithful. They also perform ""assisted"" suicide, in which the person being ""assisted"" is screaming for their life until their life is extinguished. The Truthers are one of the reasons many places condemn the church of Jhamas, seeing no difference between them and the other true faithful of Jhamas's church.

In reality, the Truthers are being deceived: it is not Jhamas who empowers their rituals and fuels their divine magic, but Orcus, who is impersonating the Lonely God before them and using the cult to undermine the church and harvest souls for the Abyss. The Truthers, seeing the ease with which they amass power, both mystical and temporal, believe they're the true worshippers of Jhamas, and lure others to their cause with promises of divinity and power. Whenever and wherever Truthers are discovered to be in action, the Only Sons immediately make it their top priority to stamp them out. Many a Truther temple has been discovered only to find it full of corpses of both Truthers and Only Sons who fought til none were left standing.

-----

**Allies and enemies**:

Jhamas abhors the Chaotic Evil gods, whom he sees as the ones most responsible for mortal suffering, and he has special hatred for demons and other inhabitants of the Abyss. Among the Demon Lords, he considers Orcus the most reprehensible of all. The Lonely God sees undeath as an abomination, another way for the evils of the Abyss to prolong mortal suffering from beyond the grave. The existence of allips is especially abhorrent to him, being the souls of mortals driven to suicide through demonic influence.

Jhamas does not get along with any Good or Lawful god whose dogma condemns suicide, and sees them as possibly worse than demons. After all, demons are at least honest about their predation on the souls of those who couldn't bear life. The Lonely God considers any god that condemns suicide while claiming Good or Law as their guiding principle to be a rank hypocrite that denies mercy to those that most need it. This is not to say that he doesn't get along with any god of said alignments, but Jhamas is strict on who he associates with. He gets along well with deities like Pelor or Ilmater, whose churches work just as hard as his to alleviate suffering. He shares Pelor's hatred for the undead and Ilmater's love for those who suffer.

Some people might be shocked to learn that Asmodeus approves of Jhamas, but the Lord of Baator has reasoning behind said attitude. He sees in Jhamas someone who opposes many of the gods he himself does, and as somenone who is just as fierce an enemy against the hordes of the Abyss as Asmodeus himself is. As such, Asmodeus has ordered his servants to give Jhamas's church a wide berth. Jhamas himself does not feel strongly one way or the other about Asmodeus, but appreciates his decision to not interfere in his affairs.

As for other gods, Jhamas is indifferent to any god to whom the souls of the dead are not a concern.

All I'm going to provide for now is the creation myth and setup. Hopefully as I get more time to write, I'll be able to give little details or even logs of what the party gets themselves into. Sorry for a BRICK of text.

**THE CREATION MYTH:**

In the beginning, there was only void.

Boiling across an infinitely vast plane, a sea of the unknowable filled all that was, all that could be, and all that would be. Matter, Time, and Space were but imagination. The eddies of this roil pushed and pulled in all directions, and none at once, with the force of all that would ever be. Thus, there was no life.

It all started with a circle. For the first time, a pattern emerged. Out of the chaos, a spinning began, and began to distribute the unknowable in ways recognizable. Like the great hurricanes of Gaia’s planes, a storm was born: The first God, The God of the Wheel, Typhus rose from this storm, fully birthed. The God of the Wheel spun, and spun, and his circle grew, burning order into the unknowable. Yet the roil of nothingness fought Typus, with ripping energies and a thousand unseeable blades, a thousand unthinkable teeth and claws. Each time Typhus fell, he was reincarnated: The God of Wheel was unkillable. Typhus, still spinning, fought on, and on - blind eternities were spent locked in combat, neither side able to wrest victory from the other. That being said, death and reincarnation was a painful and taxing process. The strain of putting one’s body back together, cell by aching cell, adds up. Typhus began to get desperate.

A thousand thousands of mortal lifespans later, his desperation led to action. Still fighting with one, newly remade arm, Typus reached into himself, drawing forth his God’s Soul - His core, the source of his being, and his power, and forged it into a blade. Thus, Moksha was born: The blade of the wheel. The sword that is, was, and will be. Creation and Destruction made whole, and balanced. The One Blade. Wielding Moksha in a whirlwind of fury, Typhus drove the void back. Back, past Terra, the mortal plane. Back, past the elemental planes. Back, past the Feywild, past the Nine Hells, past Pandemonium - Past all the planes, and all that which resides beyond it.

Thus, the worlds were born. From his essence, Typhus gave birth to each major God. He gave them each a small piece of his flesh to make up their God’s Soul: Thus, they were his children and his family, and he loved them as his own children. There was relative peace, in and between the planes, as the Gods took their place as rightful rulers of their domains, and of the worlds. All that died was reborn, through Typhus’ power, and there was perfect balance between all that was.

The Gods ruled their domains with passion and grace. Typhus took a wife in Vena, the Goddess of Love, who bore him many god-ling children, and fostered passion and compassion in the mortals of the planes. She and Typhus loved each other dearly, and were rarely seen apart: they were the father and mother of the universe. While there was squabbling, Typhus’ courts stood in to resolve conflict - Led by the God of Law, the Lawbringer, and the God of Order, the Sovereign. The Mother, the God of Forgiveness, helped to heal both the emotional and physical wounds these squabblings would cause. Finally, the Soloist, the God of Ambition, provided mortal champions the pantheon could resolve their differences through. For a time, these four deities, along with the threat of Typhus’ might, brought tranquil peace to the worlds. Crops bloomed, heroes rose, kingdoms flourished, and the intelligent races of Terra and the other planes lived in paradise. Even death was an unfeared element - those who lost loved ones could be sure that somewhere, those that passed away would be reborn into paradise again.

This peace was not to last.

War, Strife, and Conflict broke out, suddenly, and with intensity. The Gods began to fight amongst themselves, with a fury yet-unseen. At times, the wars even came to deathblows - even though the Gods would reborn through Typhus’ reincarnation. As the strife increased, and the worlds began to break: It became self-evident that something was horribly wrong. Typhus was broken. Something had happened, whether at the point of his creation, or at the point of his victory, or some unknown time in the intervening millenia, it was irreversible. Something had warped the God of the Wheel, and he was hungry.

His first son, Asmodeus, was the first to realize something was terribly wrong. He witnessed his father slowly consuming the soul of a dead mortal, rather than reincarnating them. Enraged and disgusted, Asmodeus broke away from the pantheon, taking angels and holy power with him deep into the Nine Hells. This first sin changed him utterly, the hellfire and searing blood of that fell plane transforming his God’s Soul into something incompatible with the other gods, and abhorrent to his father. Typhus’ rage was world-shaking. The war that would follow was catastrophic. Devil fought angel, brother fought brother. The planes shook with deaths and reincarnation, with blood, fire, and pain.

When the dust settled, Typhus faced Asmodeus on a barren wasteland. Both the God of Wheel and the calcified earth stood scarlet with the scarlet red seeping from Asmodeus’ wounds. With a final blow from Moksha, the sole weapon capable of truly ending a God’s life, Typhus beheaded his first and favorite son… And ate his corpse, reclaiming that which was once his, leaving only Asmodeus’ irredeemably corrupted soul. He gained, with each bite, a more powerful taste for his children’s flesh and blood. One would not be enough. All of them would not be enough. He hunted his children down. One by one, Moksha ripped each God’s Soul from it’s body: Typhus ate what remained, and reclaimed each godly domain for himself. The God of the Wheel carved a bloody path through the planes, taking back what had once been his; always hungering, hungering, hungering for more.

Three Gods escaped. Tyr, God of Justice. Torm, God of Self-Sacrifice. Vena, Goddess of Love, Typhus’ wife. While Tyr and Torm fled in fear, seeking refuge in far-reaching planes, Vena faced her husband head-on. While Typhus was busy dispatching the many Gods of War, Strife, and Murder, Vena had been preparing. Through a group of her mortal followers, whose names have been lost to history, she collected vials of the most dangerous substances ever created. A demon lord’s blood. The eye of the first beholder. The still-beating heart of the most powerful sorcerer to ever have been born. A sliver of the purest mithril ever forged. Through powerful alchemy, she made each of these into a bubbling, acidic potion, and injected each of them into her veins, one by one. Coursing with newly-acquired, strange power, she did what only Typhus had done before: she removed her God’s Soul, and forged it into a weapon with her bare hands. She brought forth the arcane focus: an emerald gem, crackling with lightning: Sedendum.

By the time Typhus reached Vena, she was already dying.

Her blood was burning it’s way through the walls of her veins, and into her tendons and bones. Eerie yellow-green ichor was visible through her pale, blue skin. Typhus, in his pride and hunger, did not realize the danger until too late. He charged, Moksha raised in his hands. As she breathed her last breath, Vena cast her final spell: a world-shattering blast of arcane blood and emerald power flowed through Sedendum - and into the flat of Moksha’s blade, which Typhus had reflexively held up. The blade that had hewn the universe shattered, and the pieces were thrown far into the world. Vena fell, dead from the poison in her blood.

With an enraged scream, Typhus flung his wife’s burnt body deep into the earth of the mortal plane. Unlike the followers of the other Gods, who had simply lost their power when their patron had died, Vena’s followers were changed forever. They gained a lesser form of their Goddess’ arcane power, and were cursed with immortality: They can never escape the burning in their veins. They can never escape mages who wish to harness the power coursing through their heart.

Typhus was wounded, and enraged. Without his blade, his power was broken. The dead would no longer be reincarnated, but cursed to roam the planes as ghosts evermore. Spells designed to bring the dead back to life would invariably fail, killing the caster in the backlash. The souls of the dead could no longer leave the plane they died on: they would be trapped in the plane of their death for all eternity.

No more Gods would die on Moksha’s bitter, razor-sharp edge. In his desperation, he made a horrific decision: He tore forth The Sovereign, The Mother, The Soloist, and The Lawbringer from his burnt flesh, and shaped them into grisly visages of who they once were. Typhus fled, and left them to rule what was left of creation. Umbilical-like cords kept them each tethered to his scorched form; they were not individuals, but puppets made of flesh. Typhus retired to the highest heights of the Higher Planes, never to be seen again, but always to be felt through the four false-gods that reigned in his stead.

Aeons have passed since this catastrophe. Meddling Elemental, Fiends, Fey, and Outsiders still encroach upon the mortal plane. Divine power is still felt in the worlds, though only through the refuges Tyr and Torm, and the four false-gods left behind. Legend says the Scorched-Wheel Typhus has spent this time tinkering, working towards a more perfect creation by experimenting both on himself and upon captured mortals. Legend also says he’s searching for the shards of Moksha, though they have yet proven illusive.

Various mortals have used one shard or another to conquer kingdoms, raze empires, and build worlds of their own, but power draws power. Someone is always waiting to lie, steal, and murder to get their hands on a newly-emerged shard. Often multiple someones. Other mortals have sought the shards to attempt to reforge Moksha itself. Many believe that doing so would allow the wielder to remake the world, or bring the dead back to life. Sedendum has been lost to time, but myths state it may have created a demiplane of it’s own, and may or may not have gained some semblance of sentience. Wizards, Necromancers, and Sorcerers have long sought it’s power, but to no avail.

The priests and priestesses of Vena still roam the planes, undying, and in agonizing pain. Made unable to tap their innate magic by some capricious twist of fate, they’re most often on the run from one force or another that desires to use them as a magical battery. If one could obtain Sedendum itself… there’s room for speculation as to whether or not they might overcome this inability to access their burning blood.

There is still a place for heroism yet. Powerful artifacts riddle the planes. Asmodeus, Typhus, Tyr, Torm, and myriad other forces still fight for the lives and allegiance of mortals. All the while the souls of the dead, with nowhere to go, are saturating all of creation...",1,The Lore of Terra: A Home-brew World

#A Valuable Investment

Shopkeeps, when done right, can be a cornerstone of a location. They:

* Are a staple of any setting; the party's going to need to buy or sell something at *some* point, and where there are people, there are other people trying to sell those people something.

* Provide one of the more comfortable opportunities for roleplay. Most people have interacted with a cashier before, and so there's something to anchor themselves to when they step outside of their comfort zone to become Gornog the Gnome Barbarian, looking for healing potions and a new throwing axe.

* Are most often interacted with during a relative lull in the flow of an adventure. This represents a prime opportunity to inject some whimsy or intrigue in a way that won't feel overwhelming or inadvertently steer the party away from their current goals.

* Tend to exist in passing for the party. Unless we're talking innkeeps (and I may well at some point), the party isn't going to be around a shopkeep long enough for the affect of the NPC to wear on them.  
 As a result, you can get a little wild with your characters here, and it can really leave an impression. (The Black Powder Merchant from CR Campaign 1 is a stellar example of this.)  

Alright, let's dive in.

---

A good, memorable shopkeep needs two things: motivation and personality.

###Motivation  
Everyone is motivated by something, and merchants are no exception. Giving your shopkeeps concrete motivations can lead to much more interesting interactions with PCs, and makes them feel like more than a game mechanic. When making your shopkeeps, try to answer the following questions:

* **What does this NPC actually want?**

* **Why do they want it?**

The answers don't have to be profound; hell, they can just be ""money"" and ""to feel rich"" if you'd like, but that's something you can rely on and use to anchor your shopkeep's actions to. If you do want to make some more complex motivations though, here's two quick tables to help in a pinch:



D4 | What do they want?
--|------------------
1 | Money
2 | Information
3 | Renown
4 | Items

D6 | Why do they want it?  
--|------------------
1 | They want power  
2 | They're searching for something  
3 | They're afraid of something
4 | They're obsessed and this is their fixation
5 | They're working for someone who wants it
6 | For someone else's sake

###Personality  
Now you've got a motivation, but who *is* your shopkeep? How do they treat their customers, both good and bad? You don’t need a complicated backstory, but 2-3 quick personality traits will give you some guidelines on how this person will interact with the party, and how they might respond to their actions in a dynamic fashion. There are [plenty](http://questingblog.com/d100-npc-character-traits/) of [tables](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/tools/1000-npc-traits/) of character traits to pull from (and a few good ones in chapter 4 of the DMG), so there’s no need to make a table of your own unless you want to. Once you have personality and motivation, you have the framework for a fleshed out NPC, and if this were just an NPC I’d say our job is pretty much done! That said…


#If you build it, they will come

What is a shopkeep without the shop? Now that we have our NPC, build outward from there. A wealth-obsessed merchant with an inferiority complex might have a whole building as their shop, with fine art adorning the walls alongside ostentatious-looking armors and weapons, and a servant at the door to take your coat. Alternatively, a nervous goblin enchanter looking for magic items to stock up on might have a small but intriguing storefront to entice customers, painted in swirling designs in vibrant colors, with a simple interior devoid of anything seemingly occult so as not to scare off those same customers once they see the goblinoid at the counter.

The level of detail you prescribe to each shop will depend on your needs and preference, but make sure it's in some way a reflection of the motivations and traits of your shopkeep. I’ve found it *undoubtedly* makes a difference to players, and makes your towns, cities, and settings at large seem more lived in. Things get really interesting once you've been doing this for a while, as your players will become used to the consistency and thus, throwing *inconsistency* at them is more likely to be noticed, which creates opportunities for interesting plot hooks.

 I’ll end my tirade by providing two examples of this at work, shops I’ve used to intrigue and entertain multiple parties in the past:

###Greatscream’s Garments

*This shop stands at the corner of a city block, fine woodwork adorning the display windows and framing finely tailored suits and dresses. Inside, exquisitely dressed kobolds scurry in and out of small doors in the walls, hurried but always polite. There is a selection of tables with chairs in a small cafe area at the entrance that acts as a waiting room where one can partake of fine wines and cheeses until their orders have been completed.*

* **Owner**: Sirus Greatscream (kobold)
* **Wants**: renown
* **Traits**: proud, charismatic, kind

(This one is always a hit with players who like non-combat interactions, as this shop doesn't sell anything with combat benefits but is FULL of RP value, and can be used as the base for various plot hooks or connections to be used later. Plus, people love the idea of a Kobold warren in a tailor's shop, it's *Rescuers Down Under* in the best way.)


###A Shabby Stall

*This market stall looks to be made of old, weak wood shoddily nailed together. Strangely, you almost didn’t see it hidden amongst the other market stalls until he called you over. The apparent owner, an old elven man, regards you with wide eyes and an unsettling smile. He gestures you forward wildly and offers to make you magical items of great power for the right price, or trade, struggling not to cackle in between each word.*

* **Owner**: Old Elven Man
* **Wants**: interesting objects
* **Traits**: insane, curious, spontaneous

(This example is one where I turn the dial up to 11 on how extra I make an NPC. He interrupts the players, tALks liKE thiS, and is overall unsettling and a little goofy. I don't think he'd be tolerated over a long period of time, but because he's usually only around for one or two interactions at a time, he's always remembered and leaves a lasting impression with the party; I've had more than one character make figuring out his past one of their goals.)

Alright, I've said a whole bunch. If you've found this to be information you already knew, tell me about some of your shopkeeps, what worked, what didn't? If this is new information for you, I hope it helps, and let me know if you incorporate it into your next potion merchant or town blacksmith!

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,77,340,"Hello! I'm a long time lurker on this sub, first time poster. So I hope my contribution will be useful. If you're just curious as to how my XP system works, feel free to scroll to the bottom. I'd like to open up with a discussion of the two major ways XP currently functions in D&amp;D: vanilla XP and milestone XP. Personally, I have major issues with both of these systems, and many of my players do, too. Let's break them down individually.

**Vanilla XP**

This is the XP rules found in the PHB and DMG based on combat encounters. Each encounter the XP values of all the monsters are totaled, and then is divided amongst the players. This has some problems with it:

* It is only based around combat. This is one of the larger sticking points for DM's. Obviously you can stick CR values on traps or social encounters, but that causes more work for the DM, and on top of that a lot of it will be very arbitrary. Did the PC's have a social encounter where they did pretty well but didn't get everything they could have? How much XP would that generate? A DM who wants to give XP for things other than combat will have a decent problem with this.

* Confusing numbers. Okay, this one isn't a massive problem but it is still quite annoying. The amount of XP it takes to level varies considerably between each level. For example, to go from level 1 to level 2 is 300 XP, but to go from level 4 to level 5 is 3800 XP. If you're only rewarding XP based on CR that might be fine, but for a DM who wants to reward XP for other things it becomes a pain in the neck to know how much XP something is exactly worth, especially when it keep changing between levels. 500 XP might be huge for one character at one level but be a meager benefit to another character. 

* It's based on the CR system. Now, I find the CR system is great to get ballpark estimates of how powerful an enemy is, but I've had very little success with trying to replicate their whole system and have it work properly. I've found my PC's can punch well above their supposed CR range, and what might be deemed a ""deadly"" encounter normally would honestly be a medium challenge for them. This causes a bit of a problem in that if I start throwing harder things at them, they will level faster, and it kind of throws the math off. It also has the problem that if a DM wants to modify enemies or encounters in a way that isn't necessarily based on the DMG they may not know how to label the CR for that encounter. 

* It requires bookkeeping and math. This may or may not be an issue depending on what kind of DM you are, but let's be honest, hardly anyone likes the extra math and bookkeeping involved here.

All in all, not a fantastic system, which is why I see most DM's these days use milestone leveling. While I think milestone is a step up, it really does have its own major problems for me.

**Milestone XP**

Milestone XP is where the DM tells the party everytime they level up, usually when they finish a quest or hit an important story moment. Typically the DM will average between how long it's been since the party has leveled, and what kind of accomplishment they're going to get, and then find areas to give them levels. Here's why I don't like this:

* A feeling of lack of progress for the player. This is a personal preference, to be fair, but at least for my players and I, milestone just feels bad. It feels bad to not know when you're about to level with your only clues being how long has it been since you've leveled before, and if you know if there's an important quest or milestone you're about to hit. A lot of times, you don't know exactly when that will be. It can also discourage players from doing things like down time or side quests, because they don't think they're going to get leveled from it as quickly as doing the main quest. And for players who don't necessarily view moving the plot forward as progression, milestone really can feel like you're not making progress.

* Loss of anticipation of gaining levels. This ties into my previous point, but when players are getting close to leveling, you can definitely feel it, and a lot of times it makes players want to do better and come up with more creative solutions, and overall just try harder in game in order to get their level sooner. Milestone doesn't really have that effect due to relative uncertainty about when leveling is going to take place.

* Inability to reward XP. Okay, this one may just be something I really like, but I love using XP as a reward for players for doing something when it doesn't really make sense to give inspiration. Did the party do something really cool or come up with a creative solution? Well, you can't really always reward that with milestone XP. Or maybe you want to award small bits of XP to players who show up on time, or for players who take notes. It just isn't possible with milestone. 

**The Way I Do XP**

Alright, so we've gone over why I have major issues with both of the systems recommended in the DMG. The system I use is inspired by the [Unearthed Arcana's Three Pillar Experience](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/3pillarxp) where each level requires 100 XP, and then players are awarded as a group various amount of XP for doing things related to the three main pillars of D&amp;D (Exploration, Social Interaction, and Combat). Players get awarded based on how they interact with each pillar. Fight a tough combat encounter? Okay, that might be 50 XP. Find a minor magical artifact? 10 XP, etc... I liked the idea behind this system, but I wasn't quite sure how I thought about it rewarding XP strictly on the pillars. So, like a good DM, I stole the bit I liked, and threw everything else out.

What I've done is I've taken the idea that each level is 100 XP (and if you'd prefer cumulative XP just start everyone at level 1 with 100 XP and then upon reaching 200 XP they're level 2, etc...) and then decided to essentially reward XP each session however I please. Right now I award it both based on how successful they were in their encounters that session, and also for achieving milestones. Finishing a quest by itself might be 25 XP, and they did a decent job in 2 encounters today and a poor job in another, so I'll grant 10 XP for the decent encounters and 5 for the one they botched. But that's just how I do it! You can modify it however you want. Here's a summary of why I like this system the most:

* It allows for players to always feel like they're progressing.

* It shows players when they are close to leveling

* You can award it based on in game performance or on out of game things (like showing up on time), and also award it to individual players if necessary.

* It's not complicated and easy to understand. I can say ""Steve take 5 more XP"" and everyone knows exactly how much that's worth.

* And most importantly, it's incredibly modular based on how you like to DM. If you still prefer a milestone form of leveling, feel free to keep in that way, and only award large amounts of XP whenever they finish quests, but now you can give less XP for a small sidquest and a lot of XP for major milestones. If you'd prefer to award per encounter, you can do that, too, or do a combination of both like I do. It gives you as the DM the same amount of control over your players progression as milestone XP does, but allows you to be much more granular and flexible with it. 

Okay, that's all I got. It's really not that impressive, but I've been using it for about 4 months now and my players and I both greatly prefer it over milestone and vanilla XP after trying both of those systems, and I believe it's a significant step up. Feel free to post your own thoughts or opinions about my system or XP in general.

**Goggles of Ethereal Sight** – wondrous item, common

While wearing these goggles, a creature can see up to 480 feet into the ethereal plane from the material plane, and vice versa. Fits most small- to medium-sized humanoids. May be available in alternate configurations for less conventionally shaped creatures, though these would be less common.   


&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereal Cube**– wondrous item, uncommon

This heavy wooden, cube-shaped box has a carrying handle on top and is carved with runes of danger and warning. The interior is lined with a thin sheet of lead. One side of the box can be removed to reveal a silvery swirling vortex inside, which is a small portal to the ethereal plane.   
 

The box exists in both the material and ethereal planes, with the box’s opening on opposite faces in each plane. (Picture a d6, where the 1 is the opening on the material and the 6 is the opening on the ethereal.) The opening is a 1-foot square (so the diagonal is 16.9 inches). Any object placed in the box passes through from one plane to the other. If the box is held upright on the material plane, an object dropped into the box will fall out the bottom on the ethereal plane. The opposite opening has a thinner leading edge, so it can be used to scoop up objects on the ethereal plane to drop into the material. 

If the possessor of the cube travels by conventional means from the material to the ethereal, the cube will continue to function in reverse as a link between the two planes. 

WARNING: An object that will only partially fit into the box is likely to be rent asunder by the dimensional vortex. (For example, passing the arm of a large statue into the box could tear the arm off and transport it to the ethereal plane. Some home users theorize that such a transported piece could then be mended back onto the whole, such that the arm only existed in the ethereal.) 

WARNING: Magical objects sundered in this fashion are likely to lose all arcane properties. However, magical items of sufficient power, such as some rare or legendary artifacts, might instead destroy the cube. 

WARNING: Intended for use on objects only. Creatures that get caught in the vortex but too large to pass through the cube may also be rent in twain. 

WARNING: The cube should not be used to transport transdimensional objects, such as bags of holding, handy haversacks, or portable holes, nor should the cube be stored inside such a transdimensional space. The results could be catastrophic. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereal Vambrace** – wondrous item, rare

This appears to be a single piece of a full suit of plate armor, made of polished mithril with a thin sheet of lead inside. The vambrace is the forearm guard, shaped like a tapered hollow tube. Donning the vambrace on one’s forearm allows one to reach into the ethereal plane from the material, or vice versa. From the home plane, the hand simply does not reappear out the end of the sleeve. On the opposite plane, a disembodied hand appears to float unsupported. One with the ability to see into both planes can see the connection, yet will also recognize which part is in which plane. 

The wearer of the ethereal vambrace can grasp creatures or objects on the opposite plane. This includes the ability to grasp a weapon and attack a creature on the opposite plane, or to retrieve objects from the opposite plane if they can fit through the vambrace or if an ethereal cube is used. Some, uh, unorthodox mages theorize that a caster on the material plane could cast spells affecting the ethereal, if the arcane focus, material component, and/or somatic component were on the targeted plane. 

Attacks targeting only the ethereal hand are made with disadvantage. 

WARNING: If one uses the ethereal vambrace to maneuver an object on the opposite plane into an ethereal cube, extreme care should be taken that neither the creature’s appendages nor the vambrace contact the dimensional vortex within the box. ~~Training videos show~~  Rumors tell of a most unfortunate incident where a doughnut was once pulled through its own hole, its filling splattered over a 30-foot radius before the cube and vambrace exploded causing a dimensional rift. The doughnut’s name was Sir Henrick of Northumbria.

Sample use: Scout, measure, plan carefully.  Using the goggles and the cube, carefully place a loaded hand crossbow in a convenient alley.  Sneak into the manor when the Duke is away and the guards are lax.  Place the cube unobtrusively.  Be sure to orient it properly and camouflage it well.  When the Duke returns to the manor and sits down to dine, proceed to the alley.  Using the vambrace, grasp the hand crossbow.  Point it across the crowded marketplace and fire it at the cube.  The bolt passes through the crowd and any intervening market stalls, as well as the manors stone walls.  The bolt passes through the cube and into the heart of whomever is sitting in the Duke's chair.  Drop the hand crossbow, remove the vambrace and stroll casually out through the market.

self.DnDBehindTheScreen,,35,291,"I’m starting a new campaign soon. My first IRL campaign since the summer of 2017 (such a long time ago) and in doing so, I’ve been thinking of an OPENER. Something to start the campaign off with. Maybe a plot hook, maybe a theme. But mainly something that forces choices. This will be a game with new players, strangers, most of them with experience. I need to pull out something to get everyone into the game, into the mindset, immediately. See how everyone functions. See what’s going to work, what’s going to have to be tossed to the wayside. 

AND I HAVE SOME IDEAS!

So here you have it. Here are several campaign starters that will start your campaign off with choice and DRAMA. And we all know I love drama. 

A FLOOD
--
As used in Deep Carbon Observatory, a great adventure from Patrick Stuart. In this campaign opener the party is confronted immediately by a town ravaged by a flood. You end your introduction by offering several scenes of people in trouble. A drowning priest, a child crying for their mother, and a small raft taking on water. Or, you know, whatever you think is dramatic. 

**Why I like this:** It can be traumatic. It can be exciting and dangerous. It can lead to RP and the use of everyone’s abilities. It can form a bond between the players and a place, just because they spent the time “saving” the place. It can lead to any sort of campaign after the fact, plus there might be a reason for the flooding other than just rain…

IXIE
--
Ixie’s are fae that replace children in the womb. As they age their presence kills those around them. They don’t know they are fae, but their legend is known by most with any superstitions. In this intro, the Party arrives in a town where an Ixie has grown. It could be a mystery, it could be a witch hunt. It could lead to the party having to make a choice about what to do with this person who doesn’t know what they are or why their loved ones are dying. It could also lead to a road trip to Mazmorra, the legendary fortress off the coast where Ixies are taken to be sequestered. 

**Why I like this:** it makes for a slow start, non-combat oriented, but full of choices. You can see, with how the party works out this issue, if they’re open to mystery, RP, and if they prefer to solve issues with violence or communication. 

A WEDDING
--
The Party is invited to a small, local keep, where a Princess is to be married. She’s not princess of much except the keep and maybe a small army, maybe an artifact that’s been hidden away for a long time, nearly forgotten. What’s important is that the Party, OR AT LEAST ONE OF THEM, was invited to be married to the Princess. There are several suitors and at the end of the day there will only be one. 

**Why I like this:** It’s kinda funny. You can have a fun, lighthearted version of party conflict, where everyone wants to marry this girl, or none of them do. Maybe the Princess is a bitch? Maybe she’s a monster in a dress? Maybe she hates the idea of marriage and will refuse anyone. If the party goes along with it, they can get a keep and that can lead to a whole mess of other issues and quests. 

OCCUPATION
--
The Party is in a familiar place, a friendly place, when it become occupied by either a religious group or a military group or even some kind of terrorist organization. This can be violent, or morose, or ridiculous. But it is full of conflict. Shops are closed down or rebranded, temples burned or replaced, armed forces enforcing curfews and new, inane laws that make living uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst. 

**What I like about this:** You can introduce two cultures, the conflict between them, and the leaders of both cultures. Presenting both ideologies will allow (force?) the party to make a choice, even if that choice is to walk away and ignore both sides. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

These are the four I have now that I’m mulling over. If you have any that you’ve always wanted to use, let me know. Or help me figure out which of these might work the best.

self.Pathfinder,,3,2,"Building a new character, and I my inspiration is Ornstein from Dark Souls.  My plan is to charge at one enemy and then charge at the next, pinballing around the fight rather than focusing on one.  There are 2 pieces Magic Items I want to eventually use for this build: Rhino Hide (later Mammoth Hide) and Belt of Thunderous Charging (Arabalest Clock, Shoes of Lightning Leaping, and Crusader’s Tabard are on the wishlist, if gold allows).  Of course, I’ll have to Shock my weapon.

I’m going to ramble through my thought process and then have the current build at the end.

Race:  I’m a martial class, so I’ll need good physical stats.  Dwarf is solid and has Slow and Steady to counteract wearing armor.  Has some alternate traits that should work fine.

Worst part about charging are the allies standing in your way, so we need a way to bypass them.  We could ask them not to block your lane, but it’s Society and that can’t be planned on.  Will need a feat or ability.  

Feat: Charging Stag Style lets us do that AND ignore difficult terrain AND lets us make one turn along the way if we need to.  Prereqs aren’t trivial, but are doable (13 DEX, Dodge, Mobility, Improved Unarmed), and I'll want Mobility anyway.

Dragon Style also lets us charge through allies and ignore difficult terrain.  Some bonus to a few saves.  Will never use the 1.5x STR bonus though.  Prereqs are a little easier (15 STR, Improved Unarmed, Acro 3).  Though would take to Level 3 to get.

Abilities: Some Barbarian rage powers seem close to ""on brand"".  Erratic Charge (make a turn, kinda?), Sprint (but need to be 4th level...would be good if i'm primarily barbarian), 

I need access to a reach weapon.  Longspear would work, would need Simple Weapons.  Or, if I’m sticking as Dwarf, Dwarven Longhammer or Longaxe.  Doesn’t quite match Ornsteins DragonSpear, but I’m not that picky.

I want this build to “come online” as soon as it can, don’t want to spend 5 levels kind of doing what I want…and I’ve become obsessed with Charging Stag.  So, the current plan/build is:

Dwarf Traits: Slow and Steady (not slowed by armor/encumbrance), Unstoppable (for Toughness and +1 FORT), Relentless (+2 CMD on bullrush/overrun).

Other Traits: Defender of Society - +1 AC in medium armor.  Adopted (Ifrit) – Hot Headed: +1 DMG on charge

Stats (after racial bonuses applied):
STR: 16
DEX: 14
CON: 16
INT: 10
WIS: 14
CHA: 6

Level 1: Unchained Monk.  Gets me Improved Unarmed (free), Dodge (bonus monk feat), for Charging Stag.  I can’t make use of Flurry of Blows with armor (but might be handy once?) and don’t plan on staying Monk long enough to worry about not getting the AC bonus or Fast Movement.

Level 1 Feat: Mobility.

Level 2: Fighter – Mobile Archetype.  Fighter Feat: Charging Stag Style (is a Combat Feat).  This also gains me Proficiency in medium armor which I’ll need.

Level 3: Fighter – Mobile Archetype.  Fighter Feat: Power Attack.  I also get Agility: +1 vs paralyses, slow, or entangle effects.

Level 3 Feat: Combat Reflexes (I have a reach weapon, seems good)

Hit: +6 / +8 if Charge / +7 Charge, PA

DMG: 11 / 12 if Charge / 14 Charge, PA

And this is where I’m stuck.  I think it’s fairly fine now, but where do I go from here?  I’m not doing insane damage, but that’s fine with me…I’m not useless in combat.  Should I stick with Fighter for Leaping Attack?  Do I continue to multiclass to pick up other abilities?

Multiclass options I’ve found:

Bloodrager (Undead bloodline).  Access to bloodrage to help my damage, the hit to AC doesn’t matter TOO much as I’m using a reach weapon.  Maybe take the Urban Bloodrager Archetype to pump everything to STR for damage and assume the HP and AC kind of cancel each other out. I do get Fast Movement and Frightful Charger which seems pretty good (shaken on every target of my charge? It’ll either be amazing or useless).  

Cleric (Travel Domain).  Low BAB hurts, but pump to Will Save isn’t nothing.  Also get +10 movement to base speed and Agile Feet which lets me ignore difficult terrain.  If I take the Varsian Pilgrim archetype, I should also be able to give Agile Feet to party members, which could be handy.

Inquisitor (Persistence Inquisition).  Low Bab again, but +2 Will.  I get Step Up for free which is great against casters and Relentless Footing for +10 movement 5 times a day as a swift action.  Can also cast Linebreaker.

Barbarian for Swift Foot and Sprint rage powers.  Will need 4 levels, so not really a 'dip'.  Doesn't really play nice with bloodrage and Frightful Charge AND Swift foot is an enhancement bonus, which doesn't stack with Inquisitor's Relentless Footing... probably not worth it.

I don’t know if I dip one of these classes (or all of these).  Is there something simple I’m missing?  A Class or archetype that is PERFECT for what I’m trying to do?  I looked at cavalier, which seems great at charging…so long as you’re on a mount and I don’t want that.  I think the Cleric or Inquisitor dips might be a little too cute to really work (and I might have deity issues to boot), but I couldn’t find anything else that really stood out that’s a huge help to my plan.  

I don’t think I need to bend over backwards to pick up classes/items to increase movement too terribly much…PFS fights aren’t typically in an open field and those that are, I probably shouldn’t end up half a mile from party members.  Some feats like Spring Attack and Vital Strike don’t work with Charge, so those are out.

self.Pathfinder,,0,1,"  Hey guys! I'm Derry, the DM of the Dice Will Roll podcast, here with a new episode of our show! We're a group of 4 friends who love Pathfinder, and have been playing it for a good chunk of our friendship! We liked the playtest for the new Pathfinder 2nd Edition so much that we decided we couldn't wait for August for the finished product. Til then, we've decided to try out playing the legendary Kingmaker Adventure Path with the new rules.  This is the result! Our first handful of episodes have a little rough audio, but we pick up swiftly after that, so stick with us! Additionally, our show features music from the Kingmaker CRPG by Owlcat Games, including some by Dragon Age's Inon Zur, used with permission from the game's devs! Though we're using the Playtest rules, we're updating constantly to follow what we know to be in the final version of PF2 to give the most accurate Second Edition Experience currently possible! Without further ado, we hope you enjoy! If you do, make sure to tell a friend, leave an iTunes Review, subscribe to our feed or support us on Patreon! And just to get you hooked, here's a teaser for our latest episode: Fables &amp; Fey! 

*Our explorers of the Stolen Lands are on the hunt: they're looking for the monstrous Tatzylwyrm, a snake-like dragon which is rumoured to lurk along the rivers of the Greenbelt! However, as per usual, stuff gets in the way- some tricksters toy with them, they tell each other their pasts, and become closer as friends! But can the power of friendship prepare them for the ghastly discovery that waits in the clearing..? Who's to say? Maybe it will, maybe it won't! It all depends on how the dice roll!*

*Stories get woven. Monsters get hunted. Dread creeps through souls. All this and more in this episode of  Dice Will Roll, where we ask the hard questions like... how do I get these annoying invisible pranksters to leave me alone?*

None of my players are familiar with the stories, so I don't have to worry about them knowing what's coming next.

Thoughts? Literally any guidance is a huge help!",0,A campaign centered around Hercules' 12 labors
self.Pathfinder,,3,4,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working in my free time on an application that I would like to make available to the community. The goal is to write a program (ideally something that could be ran on a raspberry pi with an LCD or maybe a phone app - completely free and open source) that could connect players and GM together during a session. You could build your character on the app, as well as keep track of everything. A digital datasheet of the sorts. In addition to that I would like to implement a way to connect this app with other players and the GM to form groups. During the session players could add buffs (which would get approved by the gm) and the changes would reflect in the stats of the character. Debuffs would follow similarly. I would like it if the GM could see all information for every player, but the players are limited to only their own info.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started writing up this application in python as its OOP is very easy to work with. I have found tables from d20pfsrd that link to pathfindercommunity. So I have the information needed for 90% of it. I could webscrape d20pfsrd for the rest of it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am stuck with now is creating the logic for all the individual objects, and connecting it. For example pathfindercommunity has these giant databases for spells and feats, which is perfect. On the abstract level I am stuck however.

&amp;#x200B;

From the creators point of view, when creating pathfinder did they use templates for feats,spells, etc. I'm thinking they must, for example there are equations for class BABs. The formula is

&amp;#x200B;

BAB = character\_level \* BAB\_Category

&amp;#x200B;

where BAB\_Category can take on 1 of three discrete values 1,3/4,1/2

Is there some sort of similar abstraction for classes, feats, spells, etc.? If so, are these abstract views documented somewhere?

To give a more concrete example, lets look at skills.

&amp;#x200B;

A skill has the following abstraction from my understanding:

&amp;#x200B;

* Untrained (A Binary) - indicating whether the skill can used without training.
* Skill Bonus (Integer) - the sum of (Ability Modifier, Ranks, Racials, Feats, Misc, Ac Penalty), and is the added bonus applied when performing a that skill check.
* Ability Modifier (Integer) -  The bonus gained from the corresponding ability modifier. For example Appraise checks are intellect based and therefore you add your intellect ability modifier.
* Class Skill (A Binary) - increases skill bonus by 3 if the player has put training into the skill.
* Racial (Integer) - A skill bonus (or penalty) gained for being a specific race.
* Feat (Integer) - A skill bonus (or penalty) gained for having a selected feat.
* Misc (Integer) - A sum of various temporary buffs, debuffs, and gear bonuses. (This field could be abstracted into various parts).
* Armory Check Penalty (Integer) - A skill penalty due to the armor being worn by the character.

So to my understanding the above is the abstracted template for skills in pathfinder. Are there similar templates, already worked (I would like to make sure I have it correct the first time) for spells, feats, etc?

self.Pathfinder,,22,14,"Interested in getting the input of other DMs, mostly.

The Pathfinder games I run lean toward the more serious side of the game, and I usually make an attempt to present as ""real"" a game as possible within a fantasy setting, especially when it comes to things like maintaining a good alignment, following a paladin's code of conduct, and divinely inspired characters following the tenets of their faith.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always ruled that knowingly and willingly eating the flesh of sentient creatures (Intelligence 3 or greater) is an evil act. Not as evil as say, locking villagers in a building and setting it on fire, but more of a baby step towards shifting alignment. I couldn't quote it exactly, but I remember developing this house rule based on something I read out of D&amp;D' 3.5's Book of Vile Darkness, about how eating intelligent creatures was evil. However, I know that throughout D&amp;D history, many, many allusions exist in cannon about eating grilled dragon steaks, BBQ manticore wings, dragon turtle soup, etc., always in good fun.

self.Pathfinder,,3,2,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

First-time caster here, and I decided to go with an Arcanist because Wizard or Sorcerer were just too plain for me, I guess (I know there are plenty of ways for them not to be plain -- just some post hoc rationalizing on my part). Anywho, I'm looking for some feedback on my existing skill tree, and any suggestions for how to achieve the kind of playstyle I'm going for. A little background:

&amp;#x200B;

We're running the Curse of the Crimson Throne campaign. My character's name is Kozmo, and he's a human Arcanist living in Korvosa. History of significant mental health problems, lost both his parents as a kid (Took the Orphaned campaign trait, ofc), bouts of homelessness, and a tenuous relationship with reality (I'm a trained mental health professional IRL with inpatient psychiatric experience, so I'm doing my best to inhabit his character from an informed and humanistic perspective). Essentially, he started manifesting psychotic features during early adulthood as part of his sorcerer bloodline heritage, but was homeless and had no idea how to interpret his experiences. He's also gained a talent for stealing, but typically only to survive. Over time (and through some other exposition), he's learned to control his powers somewhat through training and study of his condition (hence the wizard part, so now he's an Arcanist). Along the way, friends were hard come by and even harder to trust, so his only true companion is a pet squirrel named Chippers (as of yet unknown origin; to be explained through gameplay, ofc) who he talks to incessantly -- it's pretty one-way. This relationship will evolve as Kozmo gains more control over his abilities (AKA, the squirrel is non-negotiable -- he's already the most popular character on the team...)

&amp;#x200B;

I've avoided reading anything about the RPT, so my total knowledge of the module consists of ""it's basically a DBZ tournament."" So I figured I would do the thing that's always appropriate for a weeb tourney, and made an 11th level Unchained Monk with an unnecessarily dramatic kung fu background.

The Myth-Weavers sheet can be found [here.](https://www.myth-weavers.com/sheet.html#id=1852180)

Slardar (aka Blepmonk) is a Nagaji Scaled Fist, which means his key stat for Monk things is Charisma instead of Wisdom. This is important because this is an Intimidate build, doing the normal Enforcer -&gt; Shatter Defenses -&gt; Medusa's Wrath combo. My DM also allowed me to take the Signature Skill: Intimidate feat, and combined with my Adopted (Ifrit) (Fiery Glare) trait, I can take 10 on Intimidate checks in combat. So, anything that doesn't have HD+WIS mod &gt; 21 is going to be saving vs fear.

Does anyone have suggestions on items I should consider, feats I should swap, or that sort of thing? I've never actually played a straight martial character before, so I'm not sure I've prioritized all my stats properly.

The idea is for a spell (maybe cantrip) for luck-based clerics and such that consumes coins for a chance of damage.  The only material component would be coins.  The die type for the damage would depend on the coin type (copper being a d2, platinum being something else).  The number of die would be how many coins you put into it, but for each die there would be a -1 to damage so there could always be a chance for 0 damage.

I (a rogue) head towards a door (which is trapped) .  The DM makes a secret roll (this being the passive roll, and assuming that the DM has also been making fake rolls to stop meta-gaming).

self.Pathfinder,,7,1,"Hey all! I've been thinking quite hard about level dips, and how much they can benefit a character in the long run. Specifically about Feat-Starved build, and the accessibility to a variety of other bonuses. Since the whole point came about while theory crafting a specific build (which some of you might remember [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/8c2wqt/whipping_swashbuckler/) or [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/8g01cr/half_elf_or_hobgoblin/)) I figure I should just present with that idea. 

So, I've (finally) decided to consider the Fighter dip to get some extra feats. That's all fine, a lot of players do this. Its made better when taking an archetype that removes some armor and shield which I would get back with the dip. I was looking at some Fighter Archetypes when I came upon the Free-Style Fighter, an Archetype that provides the fighter with the Martial Flexibility feature of the Brawler. That got me thinking, why not just take a level of Brawler. 

I would be dipping max 2lvls over the course of this Swashbuckler's life, and taking Fighter would get me \~heavy armor and shields, 2 feats, and Bravery. Not too bad, total net gain all around. 

However, 2lvls in Brawler would give me \~shields + exotic close weapons, Brawlers Cunning, Martial Flexibility, Martial Training, Unarmed Strike 1d6, 1 Bonus Feat, and Brawler's Flurry. I can admit Cunning kinda overlaps Swashbuckler Finesse, and Martial Training isn't much, but the rest of the stuff I would get seems to outshine the Fighter in every way. One could make an argument that since Swash and Brawler levels both count as fighter, you can count Swash levels into the number of Martial Flexibility uses a day (though I know that's pushing it).

Please tell me if I've lost my mind. Tell me if this is actually as tilted to favor the Brawler as I think it is. If the information presented is correct, I don't see why any one would take a fighter dip unless it was for armor and weapon profs.

&amp;#x200B;

self.Pathfinder,,8,1,"So I understand the basics of how hit die work, but I'm really confused about two things

1. The first is a question about terminology and leveling up. In multiple places the book will talk about numbers of hit dice. E.g. in the introduction it says ""Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as “3d8.” This value is used to determine a creature’s total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice"" (12). Yet, anywhere I see hit die listed I only see the die type (e.g. a fighter's d10). So when they say somebody has 3 hit die, for example, does that simply mean that they are a level 3 player who has rolled the hit die at each level, or do they actually roll 3 die? If the latter, do you gain more die as you level up such that a level 3 fighter would be rolling 3d10? I doubt it, that would balloon health super fast, but I'm just confused by the description. 
2. The constitution bonus - Is there anywhere besides the description of the effects of he constitution attribute where it tells me to add the constitution bonus to the hit die? I'm sure I'm just missing it, but I want to know for future reference. Also, it's unclear to me if the first level hit points you get include the con bonus. Everyone online seems to say it does, but in the description of constitution it says that you apply your constitution bonus to ""Each *roll* of a Hit Die"" (16, emphasis mine). You don't roll at level one, you simply take the highest possibility of your hit die. So does level one count as a roll even though you don't *actually* roll? ",0,Two Stupid Noobie Hit Dice Questions

self.Pathfinder,,10,1,"Alright, first things first: Im a newbie, first time playing Pathfinder, never ever played a pen &amp; paper before, I always liked the idea though, so the chance came and im 1 year with my group, we have fun times, etc... things are great.

I started the campaing playing as a Druid (Yeah... a Lawful Evil one, Dm allowed it because it was my first time and wanted to see how would I pull it off), to get things short, a few months in I decided to kill my Druid and play as a real Lawful Evil: A Half Orc Antipaladin (Tyrant)

DM allowed me to create the character and start at the same level of the party (we all are level 6 now).Learning from my past mistake with the Druid Im really trying to pull of the Lawful aspect of Evil, but I dont seem to get along with the other characters (All of them have some kind of experience, Im the only newbie one)  I know personality is not the same as alignment, but they seem kinda ""chaotic"".As an Antipaladin my goals are to serve Asmodeus and bring glory bla bla, but I see they all rather get their own goals done first, like kill and complete missions because of rewards rather than do it for the cause.One of my teammates is playing a Half Elf Swashbuckler, I get along with him, but his character often times seems like a bard, you know... playing the charm and the sweet talk, one of my other friends is playing a Elf Sorceress, and she just seem really chaotic, a few examples are liking to cut heads of dead bodys just for the sake of it and throw them, also liking to throw bottles (not knowing and not caring if they are explosives, which most times ARE)... I mean, how can an antipaladin get along with guys like that, like they piss my half orc off all the time (I always try to play a Tyrant) and show little dedication, etc.Just in case, my Half Orc DOES have a personality, kinda easy to get along to but he does have a stick in his ass sometimes, like really proud.

* Immovable rod(s) so I can ""monkey bar"" my way along. Slow and expensive :S.

self.Pathfinder,,7,14,"Hey guys so I'm confused a bit about the wording for how the Skald learns spells. I'll put the text below for any to read but here's what I understand.
You start game with four cantrips (level 0 spells) and two 1st level spells and you gain new ones depending on what the Skalds spell chart says. At level 5 along with the Skalds spell chart I may switch out an existing spell I already know for one of equal or higher level and every 3 levels after that? So I assume this is to simply allow players the chance to switch out spells they don't like or use? And you can switch them for higher level spells? I'm very new and the wording for these can be a bit confusing so thanks ahead of time for any help I reciece! 

The skald’s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald’s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Skald Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn’t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Skald Spells Known are fixed.

At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

Their specialty lies in enhancing the [dragon's breath cartridge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/ammunition/alchemical-cartridges/dragon-s-breath-cartridge/); after gaining a flat bonus to improving the cartridge's separate misfire rate early on through Dragon Fire (Ex), they gain the ability to add bonus damage to one cartridge per round through Scorched Earth (Ex).  This is a double edged sword, as each die of damage added increases the odds of a misfire, P(at least 2 dice result in a 1).  Then, at level 7, they get the ability to stack one use of their Bombs(Ex) onto an attack roll of their choice within a 30ft cone.  Now, you can't use dragon's breath with Big Boom(Ex) since it's a Reflex save attack.  But:

1). When using Scorched Earth(Ex), does the [Reliable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/reliable/) magical enchantment reduce misfire by increasing the threshold for number of dice that rolled a 1 on damage? 

2). There is no two.

3). When using Big Boom(Ex), does the ranged attack roll qualify to trigger the [Conductive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/conductive/) magical enchantment to deliver another use of Bombs(Ex)?  If so, does the explosion center on the target of Big Boom?

4). How does the dragon pistol's ranged increments come into play with bullets (10 ft.) and pellets (15 ft.) out to Big Boom's 30 ft. range? If using pellets, is there still the 15 ft cone of effect within the 30ft cone of Big Boom? ",0,Firebrand Gunslingers with Reliable Conductive Dragon Pistols.

So I'd like to get one final ruling to run past my GM in our campaign.


&gt;The chart for eidolons show their max number of attacks based on level. Otherwise natural attacks don't work any differently for them than anything else. No penalties when using all their attacks. It requires a full attack action to get all of your attacks. They don't follow the normal iterative attack you'd get for a high BAB. If you were hasted you'd get one extra attack at full bonuses, but not all three attacks.


This comment seems to be echoed elsewhere, including on the Paizo forums in older threads.


But [the old Paizo guide](http://legacy.aonprd.com/advancedPlayersGuide/baseClasses/summoner.html#bab) says:


&gt;BAB: This is the eidolon's base attack bonus. An eidolon's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.


So, how should it work? Taking my eidolon for example:

I am level 5, my Eidolon is Bipedal, and has 2 natural attacks + a Power Attack feat:

Eidolon has +5 STR (16+2+2)


Claws (x2) | D20+9 | 1d4+5

Gore | D20+9 | 1d6+5


Feat: Power Attack

self.Pathfinder,,0,1,"Hi reddit

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:

I'm part of a group playing Kingmaker, with a mix of Pathfinder, HARP and Rolemaster (moving towards the latter because of Fantasygrounds module). But the system is (perhaps) beside the question: What (perhaps out-of-game) mechanics can I employ to make me be more true to my character? Both out-of-combat and in-combat.

&amp;#x200B;

The background for my character:

&amp;#x200B;

**Age 0-5:** Not many memories, other than that of a woman's face, perhaps my mother

**Age 6-10:** I remember both a father figure and a mother figure, however, sometime during this

period they both dissappear from my life and at the same time I'm sent to boys home in the slums of

New Stetven. My parents leave me only a map en-carved in a leather scrap. A map of a place I have

yet to discover.

**Age 11-15**: I continue to look for the placed that is mapped on the leather scrap, making my way

from day to day in the boys home. I quickly discover that I have nimble hands and quick feet and

make due by helping both the boys home nurses and wardens by carrying their belongings on a yet-

to-be-disclosed amount of time.

**Age 16-20:** I pay frequent visits to the jail in New Stetven, at first to serve time and later on with a

completely different purpose. The prison warden is as corrupt as any official in this city and soon

employ my services in return for serving no time, his hands doesn't sit idle when I return empty-

handed. That however does not happen often, and from time to time it happens on purpose, when I

discover the true value of the goods I procure.

**Age 21-22:** Through efficient use of my network, my services are frequently used on a very low-

key basis. I have more than enough for myself, and often share with my contacts from the boys

home where I don't live anymore. I live on the streets now, moving from place to place through a set

of places no-one but I know about, places like beneath bridge spans etc. Its tough not being able to

move out of poverty without questions being asked, so I don't keep more than I need. My network is

now centered around a group of gypsies that perform and act in the many taverns and marked places

around the town. Through this group, I learn juggling. Juggling seems to soothe my mind and

distracts me from the poverty stricken reality in which I live.

My search for information on my leather scrap continues. Memory of the scrap eludes me. It does,

however, seem important to me somehow. From time to time, I spend a few coins being trained by

shady characters in the art of sword fighting. I've managed to procure a short sword that is proving

very valuable when it comes to opening chests and lockers.

**Age 23:** I make contact with a group called the ”Reapers”. They describe themselves as a thieving

guild, Reapers of Secrets. They seem interested in me. Having no prior knowledge of them, I don't

yet know if I have anything to gain by joining forces with them. I'll have to know more before I join

in any venture with them.

Besides the gypsies and their acting, I've found another use for my nimble hands. Woodworking, a

big trade in this city, seems to come easy to me. I've started crafting my own bow alongside selling

a few of them to local vendors. The profit from this craft comes nowhere near my more shady

business, so it stays a hobby.

– Share with Gitte's character – BEGIN

One of my ventures go awry; On a visit to the largest tavern in the city's southern district, i spot a

traveler, ranger or fighter by the looks of it, playing a symphony of coins. Not the grandest, mind

you, but enough to get my attention. I was apparently not up to the game, she caught my hand in her

backpack. I tried the usual excuses, but I was not able to dupe her as I am most of my other, more

aware clientele. She didn't say a word and after while I thought perhaps she was not well. I couldn't

decipher the look she gave me, but when she finally spoke it was not what I was expecting. ”In

return for not turning you in..I need you to do something for me”. The rest of the evening was not

much different from any other job that comes my way. My employer did however, emphasize that

the victim somehow deserved what was coming. I didn't ask questions. In my experience, no good

ever comes from knowing more about the job than sufficient information about the item to procure,

and where to get it, or whom to get it from.

The fighter seemed to appreciate both my work and my attitude about getting it done.

After that evening, several months went by before she was in town again. Same tavern, same stool.

She was expecting to find me again, and by the gods or not, she did. Another job, higher stakes, not

much more of an effort on my part, but this time, I got a share of the loot.

Our connection stayed wholly professional. Since our first encounter, we've partnered up seven

times. Not all as jobs on my end. Working as a professional thief, you're bound to end up with more

than a few enemies. The better you are at your job in this business, the fewer knows you exist, but

working the same place more than once is not good business. The fighter helped me take care of

several gangs that had my name (or rather, one of my names) at the top of their list. Perhaps I

should consider new hunting grounds.

– Share with Gitte's character – END

**Age 24:** I've heard of a charter to venture to new lands, making use of my network I manage to find

a group for this charter. As it so happens, the fighter with whom I've done business is in the same

group. Spending more time with her should prove interesting.

Going on this venture could be good for me. I would no longer have the houses of Brevoy right on

my doorstep, which should be a relief.

self.Pathfinder,,11,7,"It’s been awhile since I last played in PFS probably about 1-5 to 2 years. From talking to a friend that plays sporadically the community in my my area is still going on although not as strong as a few years ago when I last played. Ive also been told that they are pretty relaxed.

However, Since I last played I managed to misplace the file (paper :/) I kept my Character Sheets in. But I kept all my chronicle sheets and Inventory sheets in a separate files so I still have them. I’m still hoping to find the file since it wouldn’t have been thrown away so it should just be misplaced.

But provided I can’t find the character sheet file. What is the appropriate method of dealing with it?

The characters were.

1. Level 6 Lion Shaman Druid (15xp) (PP 21)

2. Level 7 Sylvan Sorcerer (20xp) (PP 16)

3. Level 4 Archer (multi-class) (10xp) (PP 14)

1. Level 1 with 3xp (PP 6) that hasn’t played a 4th game.

In addition, both the Druid and the Sorcerer played up several scenarios and have more gold than typical for their level.

I also have some unassigned GM credit from a home game I was involved in a few years back that I highly doubt was reported correctly.

I’m fairly certain that if I just rebuilt the characters as best I can remember them that no one would care. I’m also fairly sure that isn’t allowed. Fingers crossed on finding the character sheets I’m signed up for my first game in years next Friday.",0,Lost Character Sheets

2. How does the Kineticist Suffocate (ability?) work?
3. How does the Kineticist compare with Wizards? In a single combat, a series of combats over the course of the day, and in a face off.

The Backstory.

I was playing Pathfinder the other day, and one of the other players commented on how he doesn't allow Kineticists at his table because one of his friends would played one. Apparently, this third party was really good with the rules, and his Kineticist would suffocate boss monsters. Thus, my friend no longer allows Kineticists at his table.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this was a little harsh, but as a wizard, it's no skin off my nose. Still, it got me wondering. Could a Kineticist do what my friend claimed? Apparently yes, but I don't understand the ability or how to get out of it which is weird since most abilities have a way of the target avoid the worst aspects. As I was searching the Internet for answers, I read posts claiming the Kineticist was broken and op while other posts claimed they were mediocre especially compared to wizards. I did not see explanations for these claims, and so I ask you....

After level 5 you'll start taking slayer levels with the Sniper  archetype.  2 levels is all you need to realize how powerful this gets.   The Deadly Sniper class feature lets you completely ignore the normal  30ft range limit on sneak attack damage as long as your target is  unaware of your presence AND adds your Slayer class level to your damage  on top of that.  Get a [Far Reaching Sight](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/far-reaching-sight) to hit touch AC no matter how far away you are.  It gets better though.

Well, while we were showing him Half-Orc stuff on d20pfsrd, he saw the Poison Minion and his face lit up and he immediately started throwing out ideas about how he wanted to weaponize his blood. He even threw the idea of carrying a dagger around as his weapon and cutting himself open when entering a rage to primarily injure enemies with his blood. And of course, he's also open to some minor casting later on. 

Obviously, for flavor purposes, this is a really cool idea. I don't want to rain on his enthusiasm/creativity, but I'm really not sure how that kind of character would work. Also, I know Poison Minion typically only applies to bite attacks, but I figure in the real world if your blood is toxic, it doesn't matter how it gets into someone's system.

My first thought is to dip into another class to give him some freedom. An alchemist making bombs and mutagens out of his blood comes to mind. I've heard a (stripped down for simplicity) Black Blade Magus could work, and we could just flavor in that the blade is made of his blood. I've also seen Black Blood Oracle, which seems promising, but even then the blood can only be weaponized a limited number of times per day. Also, it would probably require more than a dip level-wise, and I'm worried about Oracle as a class for a brand-new player. Maybe I'm overthinking this and I should just tell him to coat his own weapon in his blood and take it from there.

I know that if you put a bag of holding into a portable hole everything goes belly-up but I was wondering if this still applies to putting a bag of holding into my shield via my animal companion's saddlebags and my shield (and by extension my animal companion and the held bag of holding) into the tattoo.

I've also thought of the final boss encounter. We usually just kill stuff and high-ho off to the next adventure. I dont want the PC's to destroy it.The final boss is going to be a colossal rubber duck. I want to make it so the PC's have to solve a puzzle to get it down to 0 which will cause it to shrink (because silliness). I want to keep this simple and just ridiculous.

1. We want the ability to accumulate items/wealth and grow characters as normal as we progress (the amount of customization is what drew us to pathfinder over 5e)
2. We want the ability to switch the GM up from week-to-week (or one does a couple sessions, then another does one or two, etc.) Additionally here, we don;t want to get bogged down by a super long, detailed story.
3. As many visual aids as possible (seems like there is a ton of this info online and being re-released)

NG Half-Elf Sylvan Sorcerer

8 STR 14 DEX 12 CON 12 INT 10 WIS 19 CHA

Alt Racial Traits: Arcane Training (and maybe Mordant Envoy) 

Traits: Beast Bond (for Handle Animal as class) and Magical Lineage (Magic Missile) 

Feat: Toughness

Skills: Bluff +8, Handle Animal +9, Perception +6, Spellcraft +5 (FCB lvl 1 to skill point) 

Cantrips: Read Magic, Prestidigitation, Acid Splash, Detect Magic
Spells: Enlarge Person, Color Spray

Items: Acid Flask (Alchemical Focus) 

Animal Companion is a Big Cat with Weapon Focus (claws) and a standard array of tricks (7 at level 1, I think) and acrobatics/perception for skills. 



Questions I had were:

Is Mordant Envoy worth it?

          - the array of SPL seems useful to a spells known limited sorcerer, and the +1cl to transmutation is nice too, but if I'm going to be limited on skill points is the free skill Focus better? 

Is Toppling Spell a good mix with PFS baddies?

          - I know it's much more useful against Humanoids with class levels, the idea of tripping a baddie in front of my cat is very appealing if I can pull it off. But if you run more into mostly monsters it becomes significantly less useful

Is 7 hp with no mage armor for one session bad? 

          - I know I can get a wand after my first session, but what are my odds of making it through to that point? And should is 7hp risky? Should I take toughness? I intend to retrain it to Boon Companion before I hit lvl 2, so I just need to get through the first 3 sessions. I also will take the human FCB to have more spells known starting at lvl 4.

Any thoughts are appreciated, and I'm really looking forward to get him going tableside!

I've never played PFS before, so I have no idea what information players have when joining a new game. I've played for a long time, but I've never been a GM. Our group recently split up after some graduated and I'm attempting to organize a new one.

We have two veteran players, one coming from 5e, and another who has never played D&amp;D. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The main thing is what information do I give them for making characters? I played an adventure path before and it gave suggestions for classes and hints about what to focus on, but I don't see anything about that for this.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I looked at the list of events on the PFS page and it seems like players simply get a campaign name and a very short description of what to expect. Is that all the information they have or are players given the longer preamble from the book beforehand?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm sure I'm overthinking all of this, but it seems too simple. Do people just make PFS characters then just jump into random games with no idea whether their character will be useful, marginalized, or even a liability?

self.Pathfinder,,2,0,"So for a homebrew campaign I'm currently running I've put together a final boss fight that I want more experienced Pathfinder DMs to weigh in on. First and foremost this is going to most likely be the party at the end of the game:

&amp;#x200B;

Level 17 Monk (No Archetype)

Level 13 Sorcerer + level 4 Dragon Knight

Level 13 Fighter + level 4 Hell Knight

Level 17 Nature/Trickery Cleric

Level 17 Crossbow wielding Paladin (Allowing Ranged Smites with specific limited bolts)

Level 17 Shadowsworn

For plot reasons everyone will have all their abilities and health replenished right before the fight and each one given a one use passive revive from the dead.

&amp;#x200B;

So the boss fight takes place in a hell like pocket dimension known as the Wailing Void, a veritable sea of Demonic creatures with a small (250 feet from end to end) archipelago of Obsidian islands where the fight takes place. Due to plot reasons they can cross pass between islands by walking on the demonic waters jesus style because of plot reasons as long as they can make a Wisdom saving throw (DC not decided).

&amp;#x200B;

The first phase stars the boss as a Jabberwock (Lore wise the boss is NOT a Jabberwock, it's a destruction god using one as it's physical form) backed up by two Obsicidaemons, one Vrolikai Demon, and 7 rounds, back up from an Immolation Devil.

&amp;#x200B;

Once all five enemies are beaten there is a one round pause then all the corpses merge together to form a Demonic Tarrasque (Again, not the actual one, just using the stats) that can cycle through elemental damage every round.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the Tarrasque is brought to zero health it's heart is exposed and The Cross Bow Paladin will get one (At Advantage due to Divine intervention) shot with the world's one and only God Slaying Bolt to kill the God of Destruction once and for all.

This is a quick One-Roll Town generator I built with a mechanic I'm calling the Blunderbuss Engine - rolling a full standard set of 7 dice at once.

This system uses the most basic application of these soft metrics, the location of the dice on the table, to build a town map.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have so far for ideas:

1. The weapon could be one of three things: a Pata ([http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pata](http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pata)), a Scizore ([http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Scizore](http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Scizore)), or a Kineticist's Kinetic Blade.
2. The Enigma Mesmerist ([http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Mesmerist%20Enigma](http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Mesmerist%20Enigma)) gives the character an easy way to turn invisible, as well as sneak attack.
3. The Unchained Rogue would work well after a few levels of Enigma.
4. A Vigilante or even a Zealot Vigilante ([http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Vigilante%20Zealot](http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Vigilante%20Zealot)) could also work for a character more similar to the Arbiter. 
5. Kineticists can get the Kinetic Blade Wild Talent, which lets them wield their blasts as a weapon. The Kineticist can even make this weapon out of Plasma once they have access to both Air and Fire blasts.
6. Furthermore, we could double down on the Kineticist route and take the Kinetic Knight archetype ([http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Kineticist%20Kinetic%20Knight](http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Kineticist%20Kinetic%20Knight)) so that we can use the blade more often and wear heavier armor/shields.

self.Pathfinder,,4,1,"I'm mostly thinking about this in terms of Fire, but the question is just as valid for other energy blasts. Obv.

Now, the first thing that springs to mind is to actually choose a second element with Expanded Element instead of doubling down, but that does lock you out of the double composites like Blue Flame, Thunderstorm, etc. And there is the possibility of a low-level Devil to show up in a scenario before level 7, which leaves you with very little to do against them.

Recently we had a mission to protect a noble who was in town to sell some goods. Surprise, surprise! We got ambushed and the noble died. 2 of the characters wanted to report what happened to the guards but me and the CN character were like screw that! We used a wand of disguise to make me the noble and torched the noble's body in a back alley. It worked! Rolled a 20 on a check at the guard gate and made off with some pretty epic loot.

+1	2,000
+2	8,000
+3	18,000
+4	32,000
+5	50,000

it seems pretty straight forward, but then our dm said that each of these bonuses is not a total price for the total enhancement but a total price for that cost.  So we've been playing like the following:

regular sword is 15gp
+1 is 2000, so total cost is now 2015gp
to add flaming, which is also a +1 enhancement, it would be 2000 but that would make my weapon essentially a +2 (2 enhancements) so it would cost 8000, so total cost is now 10015gp for a +1 flaming sword.

But then if you find a +1 flaming weapon in your loot and you go to sell it, it's never worth 10kgp, so i, already confused about the cost, did some research to try and figure it out and i stumbled on another thread that said its [paraphrasing] ""its the cost of the enhancement minus the cost of the previous enhancement""

so if this is true then it would make the above example different as such:

+1 is 2k gold
flaming is 8k gold (acting as a +2 because its the second enhancement) MINUS the previous enhancement of 2k gold, making it 6k gold and thus bringing the total cost to 8k gold (not 10 like i previously thought)

self.Pathfinder,,12,1,"My wife and I are having problems with our DM. A few days ago we stayed for a 10 hours game and only played for a total of five minutes (my wife played for maybe two minutes). We were not happy we wasted our day just sitting and listening to the other players adventuring/scoping out a dungeon of an elder god. We also play an open world game. This is both good and bad. There is a bit of backstory here so I'll try to make it quick.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife's character is the leader of an underground freedom fighter group, very on point and logical. My character is partially mad after being tortured by an evil cult and seeks revenge but I play her as a happy-go-lucky bombastic bard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, also he hates metagaming, which is why he goes into detail how a monster/trap/magical item/obvious evil guy waiting to screw us over before we get there. But we can't act on it, we HAVE to play it straight. After a while it gets too hard to know what our characters not know, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

The game started out us saving his GF's character from an evil nation of undead and we needed to track down her father (for some reason he never explained). With the nation after us, the others at war with each other, we had to bob and weave our way to safety. Sounds like an interesting plot hook right? Too bad once we got to where the father SHOULD have been the DM decided he just wasn't. This DM doesn't make plot hooks or give us any direction. The above situation was just the party trying to find an adventure. This was also just him making stuff up on the fly and shoving 'I don't want you to do that' rules on us. In real world time this has taken us over a year of playing. We are giving no direction or purpose for anything. There is no plot at this point, we dropped the father thing and the nation of undead because the other party members have no stake in it or care. Even the DM doesn't care. Why are our characters hanging together again? 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason he spends nearly every session preventing characters, mostly mine, from doing anything. By this point in the game after a year of playing the time for the other party members for doing stuff takes minimum effort (like find ingredients for a new and undiscovered poison and make it in half a day) and the DM placed far more time on what they were doing. When it came to us to buy something it took us the whole session. Not the actual act of buying it. The items we wanted or needed would be either in too little amounts or not there at all. I'd have to make them. Then he goes full economics, every ingredient I needed, where to find every ingredient, build a still to make the alcohol needed for said item (this he made me explain in detail how I did that and roll for every act to see if I mess it up), make trade deals, etc etc etc. All I want are either healing potions or a magical brew that usually is available, nothing too crazy. Then to prevent progress from going too quickly for me he makes my character drunk, possessed, or knock out tired nearly every session.

&amp;#x200B;

So, finally, here is what happened. My character, my wife's character are over a continent away from their objectives. We missed a session or two and now we are trapped manning a store while the others go on adventures. We are basically NPCs now. During that TEN hour game session I tried to talk to him during any breaks for the other group for some way to have an NPC take over while my wife and I explore the town, find the party and help, or anything to play. Nope, our characters had to train NPCs to do our jobs so we could leave. Even when I told him what I wanted to do by summoning my Master for a chat, he metagamed knowing I was up to something, and gave a reason my Master was busy (even after I made sure he wasn't). That exchange alone took less than a minute and he passed it off as a distraction before going back to the other party. (The other party members noticed and hate that he's doing this too). The worst part is he doesn't even notice he's doing it. He forgets easily, changing rulings he doesn't remember he already made, and gets distracted by his GF who clearly doesn't want to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about it being too long, we just don't know what to do. We've talked to him before but that isn't getting us anywhere. We want to play, we want to have fun with friends, we want to have adventures. What should we do? Is there any point in continuing?",0,Problem DM in Pathfinder Homebrew

self.Pathfinder,,5,6,"I'm not worried too much about the nitty gritty right now, since that will inevitably vary based on the scenario/campaign and party makeup, but I'd like to get some basics hammered out and make sure I'm not missing things or misunderstanding things.  The basic idea is going to be a fairly normal Barbarian 2 / Oracle 4+ / Rage Prophet 10 build (depending on how many levels the character can get, of course.)  I'm not focusing on being any particular race - I'll probably leave that up to the RP/design of the character, rather than mechanics.

**Base Attributes**: Str 15, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 16.  The +2 can go anywhere, but since we're going to be a Str-based melee fighter for most of our career, +2 Str seems likely (giving us 18 at 4th level.)  Alternatively, do 14 Str and you can get 12 Dex for the +1 bonus, or 12 Wis for the +1 Will bonus.

**Oracle Class Features**:  For the Mystery, Life is pretty attractive; we're only guaranteed to get to pick two revelations, and it has some good ones.  Life Link seems practically required for anyone taking the Life mystery given how it can soften damage taken by the party.  Energy Body seems like the most versatile and useful second choice, offering a way to throw a bit of healing to party members (and it lets you move through their space without issues!), and gives you the ability to weakly heal yourself as a move action.  Not terrible.  Safe Curing is considerably less good from an action economy perspective, but not having to worry about provoking while casting healing spells could be useful.  The final option would be Enhanced Cures - allowing even a CLW to heal for a fair amount of healing.  Energy Body seems the most generally useful of the three, though... particularly given the reactive damage it deals to undead (a pretty common enemy type.)  You could also pick up Channel Positive Energy, but being good at channeling is pretty feat-heavy and we're probably going to be strapped for feats, and 1+Cha times per day is unimpressive.  Spellscar is an alternative mystery, although one I don't see as being quite as useful to the party.  For our purposes, Lame is the only real option we have for a curse - immunity to fatigue at Oracle 5th is entirely too strong to pass up, and Barbarian's Fast Movement feature counteracts the movement speed penalty!

**Barbarian Class Features**: Obviously, we have to take Moment of Clarity at Barbarian 2nd.  I don't see any archetypes worth taking since we will likely only ever have 2 levels of Barbarian and Uncanny Dodge is way too good to throw away for something like DR 1/- or other 2nd level things.  Our focus, instead, is on what to do while spending ""free"" feats on Extra Rage Power.  Perfect Clarity is a decent extension since we have to take Moment of Clarity, and Ultimate Clarity with rage cycling via the Lame curse is incredibly potent.  The other obvious choice is for a line of totem powers: it's a bit unconventional, but the Atavism Totem line has some real promise here.  The bite attack is kind of whatever (since core races generally don't get a bite attack to begin with, and it's likely to be a secondary attack anyhow), but Ferocity is extremely good (particularly with something like Safe Curing, guaranteeing the ability to heal yourself out of a tight spot) and Trample has some interesting applications combined with Energy Body.  Beast Totem is, of course, still the best ""general purpose"" line, because pounce is just amazing.  Picking up Superstition at some point is obviously recommended if at all possible.

**Equipment**:  Sword and board and the best armor we can wear.  Our attribute budget doesn't allow for much in the way of Dex and rage further reduces our AC, so we really need that shield bonus to compensate together with being unable to wear heavy armor.  Using the Armored Hulk archetype is an option, but if I'm understanding the Lame curse correctly, this would reduce us to a paltry 15 ft while wearing armor... not good.  Not being subject to encumbrance (weight) concerns is nice, meaning we don't generally need to waste money on mithral equipment.

self.Pathfinder,,34,9,"So this is a discussion topic but here is my two cents. When I first started playing Pathfinder I started out as a cleric that's the class I learned on after that character died I became a wizard. After that campaign we went to start up a new one and I said to my dm, ""is there a way to cast arcane and divine spells?"" And he showed me the mystic theurge and I thought awesome! Since then I have played a couple MT's and a few others and came to the conclusion that they are the worst prestige class there is core wise. Let's look at why I think they are the worst.

You need to be able to cast 2 nd level spells of arcane and divine, meaning you must be at least 3 levels in a arcane class and 3 levels in a divine class.

Not only are you very little help to your party on both damage and healing you lose out on having a decent amount of high end spells. Essentially you will be 3 levels behind everyone else. This is truly what makes MT the worst prestige class. It's a shame because it has a lot to offer like 

Doubling spell slots for either divine or arcane. 

Able to cast a arcane and divine spells at the same time at different targets or the same target and get pluses for doing the latter on spell resistance checks.

Decent ref, wil, and fort saves with a decent BAB progression.

All the armor and weapon proficiency of a cleric.

But the fact that you essentially cut your Achilles tendon to play this class really overshadows these benefits, not to mention when your other party members are expecting a fireball or a cure medium wounds but all ya got is magic missile and cure light wounds you're hurting the party and it just continues this way. 

But anyways tell me what you all think? How would you make the class work better? Do you think it needs fixing? Am I being a baby? What do you think? Personally I think if it was just you need to be a 2nd lvl arcane and divine instead of what it is so you can prestige at lvl 4 instead of 6 would fix it just fine.

self.Pathfinder,,5,7,"Ok, so new to reddit and new to DMing but I have always heard good things about this place.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few years of experience of pathfinder, not 2e, I have DMed a few time filler sessions when our current DM is unavailable. This year my group will be finishing a campaign we have spent probably about 2 - 3 years playing and I have volunteered to pick us up for the next game.

I have bought the Curse of the Crimson throne hard cover book with all the chapters along with having the occult book and bestiary 1 - 5, I have notepads ready for myself along with printing out a few of the enemy npc stats on paper. We're using roll20 to play on as no party member lives in the same state and some even in other countries.

The party composition is:

1. Monk who has a tiger animal companion,
2. Sorceress who has built in as a charisma caster
3. A Malefex
4. and a Rock Star

An odd group but I just want them to have fun.

Any tips on handling the story would be greatly appreciated. I feel like the book lays everything out fairly well and leaves room for DMs to shift things as needed but I also know that there are probably problems others have ran into and I would be terribly grateful to any insight that can be given before this happens.

Any and all tips and advice would be greatly appreciate and thank you for your time.

EX I want to make a character that combines the Ecclesitheurge [source](http://www.aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Cleric%20Ecclesitheurge) and Hidden Priest [source](http://www.aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Cleric%20Hidden%20Priest) archetypes. They both modify the Clerics' Domain powers, but so does almost every Cleric archetype; the Eccle allows you to swap your secondary domain each day but doesn't change the domain powers you have access to, just the spells; and the Hidden Priest replaces one of your 1st and one of your 8th level domain powers.

So, since the Eccle's domain powers never change, surely they'd work alright on the same character? Am I missing something? Or is this one of those ""at the DM's discretion"" situations where the rules are flexible in cases like this?

Would appreciate the input b/c I love the character concept (ex-warpriest of an evil god converted to a good god and swore to lay his arms and armor down to atone for his sins, but also has to try and keep undercover so he's not discovered by agents of the evil god with ease.)

So, first question is pretty simple. How do I get my knives back early...or like, ever?

[Returning](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/returning/) seems like an obvious pick, but super expensive. So, early, I wouldn't be able to do much unless I carry multiple knives or get into melee after tossing.    
[Called](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/called/) was another option I was looking at. I'd lose a swift action, but they aren't super important to me. I could move before and after throwing without worrying about my knife hitting my empty square. Still expensive.    
[Blinkback Belt](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-blink-back/) is my last option, but I'm iffy on it. It specifically states **the weapon teleports back to its strap or sheath immediately after the attack is resolved**. Would my comet attacks land? Or would it just return after the first hit? The ambiguity makes me weary. Expensive, but it isn't limited to just one weapon. Also lose the belt slot, but my headband increases my to hit and damage. I'd have to have quickdraw to make it even work, but it would let me throw and quickdraw for Parry and Reposte.



Next up is [Startoss](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-style-combat-style/) and Melee Damage. In spite of the name, it reads like you can apply that bonus damage to melee attacks too.    
**""While using this style and the chosen weapon, you gain a bonus on damage rolls made with the weapon""**    
It does not clarify that it has to be thrown. This would make the build a lot more flexible. If this were the case, I wouldn't be as squeamish about getting into melee. I did find a [forum discussing this issue](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2txjg?Startoss-style-and-melee-damage), siting the writer as it should apply to melee.    

She's starting off at level 2, so I'll have to just carry extra knives until I get a solution. Throw, move+draw to prep for parry. Rinse and repeat.    
What do you guys think? How would you feel bringing a build like this to a table that has so much interpretation involved?

Here's a new character sketch I just completed for a Pathfinder player who is going through the Strang Aeons Adventure Path!

&amp;#x200B;

Adelais is a Void Touched Sorcerer who has just awoken in an asylum and fought his way through the undead and worse horrors with a group of adventurers, all who have no memories of themselves before these events. This Chelaxian is slowly becoming the face of the party as he has high charisma and is a natural leader. Though he does not remember his past he wears a spiraling comet pendant around his neck, the symbol of the Goddess Pharasma. There is a second neclace holding a single pearl as well. Finally, Adelais has just found a featureless copper mask, a relic from his past, pulling him closer to the truth of who he is.

She'd like to play it in a PFS game.  She's indifferent to the main character's class and will happily replace the main mini with anything else that works.  

Essentially the only goal is to play a character with a pet that fits the miniature.

The problem is PFS does not allow animal companions (such as a chimpanzee) to use weapons, and only a limited number of familiars can use weapons (that list is mostly stuff like specific fey &amp; outsiders and does not include monkeys).

Can anyone think of a PFS legal workaround?
 
A few more thoughts:

* The monkey doesn't have to be a powerhouse (it likely won't be), but it does need to be a combatant on the map.
* Ideally it’d be a permanent pet (such as a monkey familiar or chimpanzee animal companion) rather than a summon.
* I recognize a monkey-shaped eidolon could work but only want to fall back on that if it’s the only way.
* Primates *are* allowed to *hold* a weapon, but typically can't wield it.
* The monkey needn't necessarily attack with the dagger but it should have some reason to hold it.  E.g. if there were an equipment-trick feat for knives that gave a bonus without requiring the holder to actually wield it (to my knowledge there isn't).
* The monkey can be modified to include things like templates (e.g. some archetypes might make it something like a celestial or entropic monkey) but it should still generally be a small primate and not something like a polymorphed imp.

self.Pathfinder,,3,7,"So I was wondering about something. Arrows fired from a bow translate their +1to attack and damage, at least as I understand it. But does that make the arrows themselves magical? 

 Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

Now, the question I have is would they count as magical arrows against something immune to nonmagical ranged weapons?

The specific wording I am looking at is this: An angry ulgurstasta extrudes a whipping storm of millions of thin tendrils to a range of 40 feet.

I have been trying to do research on good ways to cast daylight and have come across very few things that actually say something to the effect of ""this item casts daylight"". Alternatively I have found several items that say some variation of ""creates light like a daylight spell"".

This seems like a minor difference until you consider the darkness magic negating effect of the actual daylight spell. I wanted to know if these wordings actually mean something different or not.

I have included a few examples below (specifically ones I am considering as I am looking for something slotless).

If these don't include the negation effect because they don't ACTUALLY cast daylight then what are some items that do, preferably at a cost that is realistic for PFS?(I also am avoiding potions/oils because character concept/don't want to item manage for this character, but if that ends up my only option I will do it if I have to)

Here's the situation: They are currently level 5 I had the players go against a few creatures and now the necromancer is in control of a dire lion, wraith, and skeletal mage and he's using them as if they were never killed and resurrected or taken over I'm guessing he is using animate dead for the dire lion he says he is using command undead for the wraith and skeletal mage the only reason I'm a little skeptical about this is that they're level 5 but he is able to singlehandedly defeated a chimera and I've asked my other dm friends and they also are skeptical about the whole thing, but when I asked them to explain it they confuse me even more.   
There are 2 other players in the campaign and honestly, I want them to get more out of it too but the necromancer is just really taking the cake with killing everything for them basically and it's kind of taking the fun out of it.

self.Pathfinder,,8,7,"I am running a Roll20 Pathfinder 1.0 campaign on Sundays starting this Sunday and I need 5 more people for a total of 8. The game is an arena campaign, where players take on the role of one of the various gods of death from different worlds.

 Each player creates a stable of 8 first level characters, and battle throughout various matches to see which God will become the one and only god of death. Characters must be Core classes, though archetypes are allowed (clear it with me first just to be sure)

When a match is over, all surviving characters gain a level, and the god (the player) gains some gold to spend on upgrading their gear. Characters slain in battle are resurrected, at least until they reach 10th lvl, at which point death is final.

The characters you create don’t need to be complex, and the major portion of the role play will happen between the god themselves as each battles, betrays, allies, gambles, and tricks their way to a final victory.

If We can get enough players, this should be a fantastic game, but the roll 20 LFG just isn’t getting the word out.

So if this game sounds interesting and fun to you, let me know, and I’ll send a game invite and a link to the discord where you can plan out your characters and meet the other players I have.

Hey rpfam! I'm reviving a post I made around a year ago. I'm offering to draw your Pathfinder character for FREE! Once finished, I'll post the drawing here on reddit for all to see, and for you to use as you like (hopefully you'll give me credits where needed\~ ).

Check the link at the top to see some of the previous characters I've done for you creative folks, and if you'd like to follow me on the socials, check me out on Instagram and Twitch @eastghoster. I'm sure to be drawing your requests on stream.

If you'd like to see your hero drawn, shoot me a PM with your character description. A deep backstory (while super cool!) isn't as helpful as age/race/class/alignment/personality/weapons/clothes/armor or any other relevant visual stuff.

If you're a kind soul, and you'd like to help a girl out, you can also become a patron on my Patreon page: [https://www.patreon.com/user?u=10409196](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=10409196), or you can request a paid commission, and I'll get to yours first (hello Christmas!).

Hope you're all having a great end of the year. I can't wait to read your descriptions!

* Does any version of this stone cause this effect? Or do I have to chip out for an expensive one? The text on Wayfinder says *""All ioun stones of a particular color and shape react exactly the same way to all wayfinders.""* Does this mean I could buy a cracked one for 1,500 gp and it still provides Weapon Focus?    

* If granted Weapon Focus this way, does it still complete prerequisites for other feats? Such as Weapon Versatility or Dazzling Display or any of the other 100 feats that require it?    

* If I lose my Wayfinder, I lose the feat. So I'm assuming that all feats that require it effectively ""turn off"" until I reacquire my magic compass?

Played my first Core module with my first sorcerer recently, and I felt a little underwhelmed by the performance in combat.

I played through the first part of Ire of the Storm with a Halfling Arcane Sorcerer, and with a Charisma of 18, I had 5 level 1 spells, which I thought would be fairly sufficient.  However, they were all spent on Magic Missiles and Color Sprays before the last fight even began. This very well could be poor management on my part, but I'm looking to optimize a bit before I get finalized in my first level 2 game.

I've got access to a level 1 Pearl of Power, and I will have around 450 GP and 4 PP to spend before the next game.

Stats were 8, 15, 14, 12, 10, and 18, with the three (provided I ever get a chance to play past 33 XP) stat boosts going into Dex once and Charisma twice.

My spells so far are Magic Missile and Color Spray, with my only attack cantrip being Acid Splash. I'm not sure if I could really be more effective by changing those at only level 2.

self.Pathfinder,,1,1,"I was just curious if any of you had some very entertaining stories about any quests you were a part of or GMed?

I was just thinking about the previous campaign I was in with my Half Orc Ranger that was a part of a secret druid community that lived in a grove deep in a forest. I am a very curious player and am sometimes a nuisance to my party because I am always sniffing around. Constantly people watching and trying to be aware of my surroundings.

One day, we stroll into a really big and important city to talk to basically a high priest. I just recall there being one hell of a mission involving clockwork beings and it was intense. Anywho, when we first got into the town, I go into ""need to buy some supplies"" mode and find this run down little cheese shop. Of course, not without plenty of groaning and complaining, I go in. The place was a MESS and the poor ragged man who owned it barely had ANY cheese. I genuinely just wanted to get some snacks for the road but something about this poor man and his stories of misfortune struck a chord with me. I also loved the cheese and had even somehow got an appraisal on it that told me it was some AMAZING cheese. Well, being the half orc ranger found and raised by druids, I tipped him very generously without thinking of how much I actually gave him. Living in a grove with a bunch of druids, ya don't really have too much use for money, ya know? He was so grateful, he ended up giving me the rest of the cheese in his shop!

So here I am walking around this big city with a bunch of cheese and we enter the ""rich"" area of town that is separate from the ""poor"" part of town. No high priest is going to be mingling with the commoners, ya know? WE make our way to the nearest inn and start shmoozing the the inn keeper. I don't recall how, but I ended up leaving some cheese with the inn keeper of this super shwanky inn. I think he was super hungry and I had a bunch of cheese while trying to shmooze him, so I offered him some of it. Eventually, we move on with the mission, complete our quest, and leave the city.

Fast forward, like a week or two and we had to return to the city to visit the high priest again. As we enter the ""rich"" area, I hear a bunch of yelling from the side and get pummeled by someone. It is the poor ragged man, only, dude has the cleanest threads and looks like a brand new man! Turns out, between the tip I left and giving the cheese to the rich inn keeper, I made this guy one of the richest people in the city! He took the tip I gave him and made a shit load more of his cheese! Turns out, the inn keeper loved the cheese so damn much that he sought it out and found the ragged man with all of his newly created cheese! He now supplies most of the cheese to the higher class in the city, was able to move into the nicer part of town, and opened up a brand new shop that has a damn line coming out of the door all the time! As a thank you, he dumped a shit load of money on me and told me I can always come back for free cheese :).

self.Pathfinder,,6,2,"Hey guys,

we're about to start a new game in a **low magic** setting that starts and ends at **level 6.** The general setting is a kind of van Hellsing monster hunter setting, mainly lycanthropes as enemies, maybe a few demons and devils according to the gm.

So fitting the theme i thought i'd do a repeating crossbow build like in the van hellsing movie and because i can't remember anyone ever trying to do crossbow build. And now i know why - crossbows really suck compared to bows and even more (naturally) compared to the standard 2 handed Weapon build. But whatever. Brief research made it clear that the only way to make it kind of work is the **Bolt Ace** variant for the Crossbow Training of the gunslinger. So we'll stick with that. But since we only need 5 levels of Bolt Ace i was wondering what i should take for 6th.

Two options crossed my minds:

1. Ranger for the favored enemy since we'll mostly be fighting Human(Humanoid) sub types. Also the tracking feature sounds very fitting for the hunter kind of setting.
2. Fighter to use the bonus talent to grab **Vital Strike** on level 6. With the d10 damage dice i think that would a decent option.

Sample build looks like this:

15 points stat buy (rules also say no stat above 14 before racial and level up adjustments. Additonally we get 2x1 attribute points on level 4 instead of 1x1)

**Vanara Bolt Ace**

STR 10

DEX 18 (14 + 2 + 2)

Con 14

Int 10

Wis 16 (14 + 2)

CHA 8 (10 - 2 )

&amp;#x200B;

**Weapon**: Heavy, repeating Crossbow

**Feats**: 

Level 1: Point-Blank Shot

Level 3: Deadly Aim

Level 4: Precise Shot (Gunslinger Bonus feat)

Level 5: ?

&amp;#x200B;

I am intentionally not going the Crossbow Mastery/Rapid Reload way and instead try a one shot/one kill kind of route to try and make as much use of the sharp shoot deed.

 **Sharp Shoot (Ex)** At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed’s cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs .  


 Ideally i try to stay in stealth with my 120 ft range and hopefully don\`t even need to reload during the fight.  


Every input is welcome :)

self.Pathfinder,,12,10,"Basically, my character concept is a wise but aged man in hit late 70’s, so not necessarily melee combat built. Through backstory, he’s bestowed with the power to summon this Eidolon to his aid. The only thing is, it’s a 1 minute ritual to summon. Which means, whenever we jump in to combat, it would take me 10 rounds to get my Eidolon out, during which time my feeble old fella is likely to bite the dust. Summoning beforehand is circumstantial and doesn’t work if we’re surprised. Without the Eidolon, my character is pretty useless combat-wise, so I was talking to my DM about allowing the summon as a standard action. I know some have also said about summoning at the start of the day and just keeping it out, but I also don’t want to walk around town or talk to NPC’s, meet with royals, barter with merchants, cook, sail, etc while enshrouded in a monstrous murder machine. I was thinking more of a symbiotic/The Guyver type situation. 
I also said that outside of my dismissing the Eidolon, if it’s dismissed for any other reason - death, banishment, other magic, etc. - that I would need to use the ritual to resummon it back the first time. So basically I summon it back, then it just goes in to hiding when not in use. 
If there’s a penalty or balance you suggest for this too, I’m all ears. And I know disguise self and all that, but I’m starting at level 1 and I don’t wanna burn a spell slot just to walk down the street every single time haha.

self.Pathfinder,,6,6,"My wife uplevelled here character to a level 4 Ranger last night, meaning that she got her first spell slot. For most people, this would be a cause for celebration... not so much in her case. Not only did she feel that her character wouldn't use magic (and that Rangers having magic in general was a bit strange), but she was also horrified at the thought of having to remember a load more stuff that her character could do.

I tried. I reskinned most of the L1 Ranger spells to be non-magical (Delay Poison is now a concoction that she can prepare from herbs and roots, Pass Without Trace is now the ability to effectively hide her tracks by mundane means, Calm Animals is now kinda like that scene from Crocodile Dundee with the bull (showing my age there) and so on...) but she still isn't happy about only being able to use them once per day (not from a munchkin perspective, but because it doesn't make sense to her that you could only do the Crocodile Dundee trick once every 24 hours unless it was magic), and there are still too many for her to keep track of.

My other solution is a bit more extreme; I'm considering letting her pick individual spells (one at this level, then as per her spell slots) and have them as at-will abilities, kind of like non-magical cantrips.  My concern is that this might be a bit OP - it's limiting in one respect, in that she only has access to one Ranger spell/ability instead of the fifteen or so L1 spells - but the flipside is that she's effectively going to have multiple uses-per-day of that selected one. Ranger spells are pretty specific, it's true, so it's not like she's getting unlimited castings of Fireball, but I'm still wary of this approach.
