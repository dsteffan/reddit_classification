Basically, you live with all the comfort aviable, but your corpse is reanimated upon your death, and made to work the fields, clean the streets, or whatever necessary. I came across one of the reposts of this proposition recently, and thought..what about vampires?

Now, I know what you are thinking. Vampires are evil. They are parasites. There is no way for them to be redeemable.

So, give me a second.

In pseudo-medieval setting D&amp;D is designed around, taxes are mainly paid in form of food to the table of the lord. Either directly (i.e. you surrender part of your crops) or indirectly (you work on your lord's field, in addition to the field you own. What grows on your field goes to you, the lord's field produce goes to them). Or you could pay money to the lord instead, but most common folk didn't really have enough money to do that.

So, what happens when we change the lord with a vampire?

The lord needs common food no longer, hence all the crops fall to the peasants, making them better fed, and thus healthier. The vampire needs blood. Now, since MM doesn't specify how much or how frequently, I'm going to go with 1 human worth of blood per month in total (i.e. multiple people can be sucked for less, but still the same grand total), minimum. That leaves us with about 5 liters (or about 1.2 gallons) of blood.

With 30 villages, this gives us less then a glass of blood per village. So, each month, instead of crops, each village will send a single member to the vampire. The vampire takes bit of blood, leaving the villager bit dizzy, but otherwise ok. Given each village has around 100 people, or more, each donor will only have to go once in few years. And they will recover much sooner, thanks to being well fed.

In addition to decrease in the costs to maintain a lord, i bumps up the defensibility of the domain., given all the vampire abilities. And if army is needed, the soldiers recruited from the area will be better fed, healthier, and possibly better equiped thanks to surplus, then any invading army.

The vampire gets voluntary donors of blood, meaning higher survivability for him as well. They might be evil by nature of the curse, but they are lawful evil. And thus will uphold his promise to not take more then necessary.

Granted, it's not really that great of a model for larger realms, but for a small mountain county? Seems good to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDITS AND CLARIFICATIONS:**

1) Many of you pointed out that taxes are here to pay for more then lord's sustenance. To answer the most commonly brought up topics:

* **Army:** Some point out that money are needed to maintain an army. What they seem to forget is medieval lords didn't maintain large standing army. Maybe 1 guard per 500 peasants, if that. If army was needed, peasants were rounded up and armed by simple weaponary. One vampire is combat force equivalent of at least 10 trained soldiers, with fraction of the cost to sustain them. 
* **Upkeep of roads:** That is something the peasants are expected to do for free. Alternatively, if our vampire lord is coupled with necromancer, it could be done by zombies.
* **Trade:** In medieval times, trade was fully withing the rights of the serfs. Lords just collected taxes from the trade.
* **Law&amp; order**: see first bullet point.

2) ""Vampires are evil. If one got to rule country, they wouldn't restrain themselves to eat just once a month. ""

Vampires are *Lawful* evil. They can make bargains, and will hold to them. And then can restrain themselves, if it's more beneficial for them then not restraining. And, the strategy mentioned above is more beneficial to them then sucking people dry.

3) ""Vampires are dark and twisted, and the land they dwell in rots and is infested with wolves and plague""

Vampires are obsessive over the topic they lived for. While Strahd was all about causing suffering to others, and finding the girl again and again, he was kinda asshole in his life. A peaceful bookworm type noble would probably just turn into very obsessive book collector, that need to have copy of every book in his library, and won't allow anybody to go inside the library. In essence, he will become the librarian from  *The Name of the Rose* .  Paladin that always did the best for the people will still do *what's best for the people*.

As far as regional effects go..plants wither and die, sure, but only in 100 ft around the lair of the vampire. Not the whole region. Just 100 ft. around the lair. In other words, it won't even cross the lord's castle's walls. Not a word about plague. There is bit more rodents in the are, true, but that just means more cats will be bred. 

4) I fully acknowledge it wouldn't really work with larger country, like, let's say Roman Empire. That being said, smaller country, like barony, or county at most, especially on the outskirts of civilization, or in mountains, shouldn't really have be that much of a problem.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is ages old argument that necromancers would be pretty much good choice of local lord.

So I'm sitting here at work the day after my group's weekly session, and I can't stop thinking about how amazing the showdown with Acerak was last night, and we haven't finished it yet!

First, our party consists of a Human Grave Domain Cleric, a Gnome Evocation Wizard, a Tabaxi Shadow Monk, and me, a Human Bear Totem Barbarian. We had a near TPK at the beginning that only my Barb survived, but this party has made it through Omu and the Tomb together without any casualties on our end. All this to say that we as players and characters are very invested in stopping the Soul Monger and Acerak.

Now the actual encounter was very well constructed, and I'm not sure if that is more to WoTC or our DM's credit. Either way, it was hands down the best encounter I've ever played.  The arena is great. There's a huge pit of lava you have to deal with, or, as in our case, use to your advantage. There's also several platforms and struts that you can jump to or move across in case you lose flight, as we did. There are minions and waves to the encounter, at least that's how it played for us.

The Atropal went down fairly quickly, but its Wail was super scary. Exhaustion is such an underused mechanic and gaining a level each round was terrifying. Our Cleric had to Greater Restoration herself to avoid the disadvantage on Saves.  We also managed to Fear the Sewn Sisters away, so we had a bit of a premature celebration. Then Acerak arrived for our mostly full capacity group of level 12 adventurers. He was a bastard. 

Acerak was a great final confrontation. Our strategy broke down to me grappling him and tossing him into the lava, and when he teleported out our Monk beat the snot out of him with her Staff of Striking. Our Wizard kept Counterspelling whatever spells she could while trying to crowd control the room. She cast Scatter for the first time in what was one of the best moments of the fight getting our Cleric away from a Giant-Ape-Polymorphed Night Hag and a Specter. 

Our Grave Cleric kept canceling Crits and using Mass Healing Word in the last stage of the fight. She also used a Path to the Grave on the Atropal which is what allowed us to finish it off so quickly.

It was an intense fight, and it lasted for **SEVEN** rounds before we finished Acerak, which is crazy since most fights, in my experience at least, last 3-4 rounds at most. I started worrying, before I clotheslined Acerak into the lava for the last time, that my Rage would end leaving me defenseless for a round. 

We finally called it a night after Acerak died, and the Monk got the Wizard back up with a healing potion. However, the hags finally made their Wis save against the Wand of Fear and are heading back. We took stock last night after the session, and our Cleric is at 1hp, I'm at 3, the Wizard has 8 from the potion, and our Monk is almost out of Ki and barely in the double digits HPwise. 

We killed the ancient Lich Acerak, but we may fall to the Sewn Sisters as they're still Polymorphed into Giant Apes. Our fate will be decided next Wednesday at 6:45 CST, and I can't wait!

Which makes sense because Gandalf isn't weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

I built it as if I was starting a campaign with a level 11 character so he has 2 rare magic items and 1 uncommon magic item. Longsword+2, Studded leather+1 and stone of good luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so the breakdown of what I built and why I chose certain things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Race, Scourge Aasimar - Maia are about as close to angels/devils as you get in the TOlkien universe, you see that represented most clearly by Balrogs and Sauron who all are Maiar. I picked scourge because of the racial feat. Radiant Consumption sounds a lot like some of the things Gandalf did to use light to harm Orcs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Class - Storm Sorcerer 5/Hexblade Warlock 5.  - Hexblade is self explanatory. Storm sorcerer was where I struggled. Metagaming Dragon ancestry would be the way to go because of that boost to AC and HP. But Gandalf showed no elemental resistance. Wild Magic works to a point but it's more Tom Bombadil. Storm and Divine were where I settled. I went with storm to use that gust of wind escape as a flourish. Bummer is that he gains elemental protection later but I just kind of live with it. 

  
Hexblade took pact of the blade, again for more thematic than anything. Pact of the Tome also would work really well. I did this for thirsting blade though. Invocations are Agonizing blast (attack from afar) Misty Visions, and Thirsting blade. This character has a lot of spells, For cantrips I mainly went with thematic ones. EB for damage of course. Others are a mix of thematic and damage

Lots of great opportunities for damage. I thought about instead of Warlock going Paladin. But I think for flavor in this build I wanted to go Warlock for a more potent caster.

Stats - STR 7 (woo bad roll) Dex 18 CON 18 INT 14 WIS 15 CHR 20

AC 17

Proficiency in Arcana, Intimidation, Insight, and Perception. WIsh he had performance as well but it's ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I said I also worked on a Paladin/Sorcerer build, it's actually mostly the same build, thematic difference is dump in Dex for STR which means I require a slight tweak where he needs some mithril chain or something instead. But I prefer this build for thematic purposes. 4 times quicken fireball baybeee (convert 3 1st level spell slots to Sorcery points, or to be mean, convert both your pact slots into SP then short rest) Can you imagine the carnage of having your Radiant Consumption  active hexblade's curse you get 2 attacks (+11 to hit 1d10+7) so assume both hit you're looking at a decent amount of damage (add 4 damage per attack plus 10 once) so you're looking at 12.5+12.5+8+10 so 43 damage which is pretty healthy. But then hey look a horde of enemies somewhere over there, Boom Quicken spell fireball or boom quicken Scorcher, or when you hit level 7 as a sorcerer, boom blight. So assume you have a group of enemies you can deal some damage to say a group of 4, you're looking at dealing 100+damage in a round.

After the Revised Artificer from WotC came out some time ago and didn't quite deliver on what I hoped for, I saw this Homebrew op up quite often. So after some reluctancy (25 pages?!) I looked into it a bit and was pleasantly suprised. It has a whole lot of possibilities without stepping on the toes of the DM with magical Items. That was what I disliked most about the UA-Artificer.

Now after taking some days to read all of it, I am considering to allow it in my campaigns as well, if it comes up. But it is a whole lot of work to balance check it all, which is why I wanted to ask for the opinion of the hive mind: 

1. How balanced do you think this homebrew is?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a DM who is a real stickler for the rules, but a fantastic DM. I am currently a level 4 wizard with a rat familiar (named Gerald, he's great) and I am facing the problem of AOE spells. Burning hands drops and my rat on my shoulder instantly dies. I want to stop that. Obviously there is the option to dismiss him as an action, but I would rather not spend my first round of combat doing that. Further the rat isn't always capable of running away and hiding on his own. Talking to DM is also obviously an option, but if there was a Rules based way of doing it I know he'd be much happier!

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to keep the rat on my person and safe?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I put him in my backpack or bag of holding for the fight, would he be safe from AOE's there? I know that AOE's like burning hands don't ignite items which are worn but would that protect the rat from AOE?

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, would full cover protect him from those abilities?

Talking to DM is also obviously an option, but if there was a Rules based way of doing it I know he&amp;#39;d be much happier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to keep the rat on my person and safe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I put him in my backpack or bag of holding for the fight, would he be safe from AOE&amp;#39;s there? I know that AOE&amp;#39;s like burning hands don&amp;#39;t ignite items which are worn but would that protect the rat from AOE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, would full cover protect him from those abilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

So after...5 months?  Jesus that took forever.  Whatever, the point is we finally wrapped that side story up so I figured I'd give you all some closure.  I recommend reading the previous story because there's going to be a lot of context I'm not going to go over because I'm lazy.  But to sum it up, the party went bar hopping with the Imperial Family of the largest empire on the planet and the family's kickass bodyguards.  This lead to some romantic tensions, wacky hijinks, bar fights, and one bodyguard getting arrested for allegedly committing murder.  Here we go.

The story picks up right where we left off: the party and the Imperial Family book it to the prison to learn about what happened to their good friend Rowena.  Rowena reveals that thanks to all the booze she had the previous night she can barely remember what happened after the bar brawl.  All she remembers is standing in an alley over a halfling corpse, her axe coated in blood as the City Watch arrested her.  The emperor wants to simply pardon her right there and then but Rowena refuses because 1). That would be an admission of guilt and she doesn't know if she did or not and, if she did she wants to face the consequences, and 2). The halfling was a respected defense attorney named Harmon Longfoot.  If the emperor pardons her for the crime, then he admits Rowena murdered a respectable man.  And in a time of war, having a ruler do such blatant power abuse wouldn't sit well with the populace.  So the imperial family begin to make preparations for the trial set to happen in a few days, which I don't think is how law works but this is medieval times and everything I know about law comes from Phoenix Wright so y'all gotta learn to deal.

The party had about three days before the trial so they had time to investigate matters themselves.  They also learned that Rasha had been put on probation thanks to her actions the previous night so she decided to help with the investigation.  I had like two weeks between the last session and this one so I managed to prep a ton of locations each with one or two clues to move the investigation along.  I tried to make it so it could be done in any order and I feel I more or less succeeded.  I also wrote up a trial scene in the style of Phoenix Wright with witnesses and testimonies.  I had a plan and like all plans they failed after contact with the enemy- I mean players.

**Investigations**

First, our furry arcane trickster Wyld went to go talk with a contact of his in the city, a spy running a carpenter's guild to gain intel on the city.  The contact told Wyld about the various criminal factions, mentioning a new one that had popped up a few months back- an individual known only as the Blackguard.  Not much was known about them other than they operated in the poorer districts of the city.   Meanwhile the rest of the party met up at the city library to meet the lawyer and work out a defense for Rowena's trial.  Back with Wyld, the rogue investigated the crime scene.  He had to do so in secret since the Watch didn't want civilians at the scene.  His good Perception check helped him see a woman looking down at the scene from a nearby apartment before closing the curtains.  Sneaking past guards, Wyld found the woman and interrogated her.  Turns out she had witnessed the entire scene- two cloaked men had attacked Harmon in the alley when Rowena appeared to try and save him.  She slashed one of the men (explaining the blood on her axe) but the assailants slipped away right before the Watch came and arrested her.  The witness wanted to confess what she saw but the Watch members that arrested Rowena threatened the witness to keep her silence.  Wyld promised her a safehouse in exchange for her testimony and managed to get her to his spy contact safely, avoiding some not-so-conspicuous tails along the way.

Wyld returned to the library and reported his findings.  The party decided that they needed to investigate Harmon's death further while keeping their witness safe.  So they split into two groups: one group (Thurmiir, Doc, and Emil) would take Rowena's lawyer to the Watch HQ to investigate Harmon's corpse and cast *speak with dead* on it while the other group (Foster, Wyld, and Vette) would keep the witness safe until they were sure they could trust the Watch.  Rasha elected to escort the imperial family back to the palace and, after disguising themselves with *seeming*, the groups set off.

**The Watch Conspiracy**

Group 1 headed to Watch HQ.  They were told that *speak with dead* had already been cast and thus couldn't be cast for another 10 days but they were welcome to have their lawyer examine the body as this was within her legal right, something I learned that very session because I don't watch Law and Order.  The moment the party stepped into the body storage, the Watch cleric cast *silence* on the room and the lawyer was shot in the head, killing her instantly.  

At the exact same time, Group 2 made it to the safehouse easily and discovered that Vette's new beau Travis JUST SO HAPPENS to work there. And what do you know, Vette chose the SAME EXACT DISGUISE as last night, meaning Travis recognized her! HoW cRaZy!!! So after dealing with that awkwardness, group 2 kept the witness safe but were interrupted by a crossbow drive-by.  Thus, I ran two different fights at the same time.  Group 2 fireballed the crossbow assassins and killed them rather quick while Vette accidentally revealed her status as a Valkyrie to Travis, much to his bewilderment.  Group 1 meanwhile knocked out the guards (Emil chopped the captain's hand off with his ~~lightsaber~~ SUN BLADE) and the gang boarded up the room as more guards came to bust them.  Thurmiir cast *sending* to Rasha to bring reinforcements to Watch HQ and she quickly arrived.  They investigated Harmon's body and it was revealed that he died from small blade wounds, *not* a massive greataxe.  Coupled with the witness testimony Group 2 provided, the party had gathered enough evidence to exonerate Rowena, making all my trial prep work completely useless (it was gonna be so cool guys, there was gonna be false testimony and a paid off judge to rule Rowena guilty, you have no idea).  However, celebration was cut short.  Though Rowena didn't kill Harmon, someone with the connections to bribe a lot of Watch members did and no one knows why.  And to make matters worse, Rowena's magic axe, a legendary axe containing awesome power that was once wielded by a famous hero, has been stolen from the evidence locker.  The investigation has just started...

**Putting the Pieces Together**

Interrogating the corrupt Watch members revealed that they had been paid off by the mysterious Blackguard through their mysterious go-betweener, the Firebrand.  The Firebrand was an intimidating human whose description matched that of Vette's new boyfriend Travis, a red herring meant to sow mistrust but was never picked up on (my group has literally just learned this fact from this post most likely).  The Watch communicated with the Blackguard through magic paper that transferred the message to a different piece held by the Blackguard.  The party had found like 3 of these things and NEVER did anything with them.  I honestly don't know why.  

Anyway, the Watch had no idea where to find the Blackguard and didn't even know who or what they were.  Thus, the party went back to investigating.  After going to Harmon's estate and talking to his wife, they learned that Harmon liked to spend some nights at a noble friend's house for wild sex parties that can only be attended by invitation.  Luckily (?), the one-armed, 60 year-old wizard of the group, Doc, had received one not too long ago through carousing.  So he brought Foster as his plus one and they set out to work (in more ways than one).  Talking with the noble, the party uncovered that Harmon had been working on a top secret case of his own investigating a shifty prosecutor named Calser Vormop before Harmon's death.  And with the help of Not!Amy Santiago, the try-hard imperial palace guard with a massive girlcrush on Rasha (which is just like a *whole* other thing), the party found where Vormop works.  The gang (plus a now free Rowena and a jobless Rasha) tracked down the lawyer and learned the final pieces of the puzzle.

Vormop had been contacted by the Firebrand as well to falsify evidence in favor of their men.  When Harmon got wind of this, the Blackguard had him assassinated to silence him.  The Watch were supposed to stonewall the investigation and sweep it under the rug but when Rowena dashed on to the crime scene everything went to hell.  To save their own skin, the Blackguard had Rowena pinned for the crime in order to steal her axe.  Vormop, wanting to save his own skin, told them that while he didn't know the Blackguard's location, he knew another corrupt guard who did.  After some shenanigans with the dwarf cleirc Thurmiir (who had snuck off to find the guard first and decided to to try and solve the case himself because he's an asshole), the party plus Rowena and Rasha discovered the Blackguard's secret headquarters, hidden in the tunnels beneath the city.

**The Blackguard Revealed**

The party battled through some guard drakes, survived a booby trapped hallway, and fought some drunken Watch members in the hideout's brothel, and charged into the Blackguard's quarters.  There they discovered the Blackguard was a female red dragonborn named Kerrhylon Synthrin (god I hate dragonborn names).  Synthrin revealed that she was once a good paladin who was left behind as a POW by her fellow paladins and decided that being good had gotten her nowhere in life.  So she began worshiping Tiamat, called up her rich sorcerer brother Ghesh (who disguised himself as the human Firebrand) to help fund her operation, and became the Blackguard in an attempt to rule the criminal underground.  With her tale concluded, Ghesh appeared with reinforcements and Synthrin activated Rowena's axe to begin battle.  It was a hard fought battle, especially since Ghesh could Subtle Spell *counterspell* to secretly negate magic (as ""punishment"" for the party having two counterspellers.  Seriously guys, LET ME HAVE FUN BY FIREBALLING YOU TO DEATH IT'S NOT FAIR).  But then Wyld completely wrecked the encounter first by using a Wand of Wonder to turn Ghesh into a statue and then by knocking out Synthrin with a well place sneak attack *shadow blade*.  With that, the battle was won and the investigation was over.  Rasha was knocked unconscious in the fight but everyone agreed not to talk about that ~~for their own safety~~ out of respect.

**Epilogue**

The Kerrhylon siblings, as well as everyone connected to them, were arrested and as thanks the party received all siblings magic swag- including the Headband of Intellect that made Ghesh a genius instead of the blithering idiot he secretly was.  Rowena was sent home a free woman and the party convinced the prince to take her on a Not!Date to lift her spirits.  Vette has decided to try and pursue Travis and see where things go and be honest about who she is (which Foster has begrudgingly blessed).  Rash took to heart what everyone said about letting herself be happy and we ended last session with her knocking on Emil's door to talk about what happened.  And the party got a whole bunch of swag and gold and will soon be heading out to the magic capital of the world to deal with a warforged uprising, magical shenanigans, and to buy magic trading cards.  Also they made a customizable weapon with basically Materia slots and a shield that catapults alchemist fire.  Because why not I guess.

Thanks to these sessions, I learned a lot about prepping a mystery adventure, the Three Clues Rule (always have at least three clues because the party will either ignore or misinterpret the firs two clues), that sometimes you do a lot of work that never gets used, and that the Wand of Wonder is a FUCKING STUPID ITEM THAT COMPLETELY RUINS THE BALANCE OF THE GAME AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE BECAUSE IT'S SO FUCKING DUMB.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a few people seemed to be interested in a follow up to &lt;a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/9u67c1/love_confessions_girl_fights_and_murder_how_my/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; I made about a completely improvised session that derailed my campaign in the best way.

I'm playing in a PvP one-shot as a tempest domain cleric tomorrow, and I was wondering how my Wrath of the Storm ability interacts with multiattacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

It reads: When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

&amp;#x200B;

The target would also be knocked back because of my Thunderous Strike ability. If I'm hit with the first of a fighters multiattacks, can I use a reaction then to knock them back or do I have to wait until all their attacks are over?

I got to thinking about this because the PHB makes stealth and perception overly complicated, especially when it comes to defining perception checks made with specific senses.

Rolling for stealth doesn't do anything to make you unseen. You have to be obscured by some other means *first*, before you can even roll for stealth (such as hiding in darkness or fog). What stealth **does do** is allow you to move undetected by making your movements *quiet*. Things that make you noisy (heavy armors) give you stealth penalties. Things that make you quieter (boots of elvenkind, pass without trace) give you stealth bonuses.

On the other hand, when enemies try to perceive you they supposedly use ***all*** their senses to do so, *right?* Well, not really. Sniffing out enemies with the sense of smell only make sense for some beasts, especially those with keen senses of smell. What's more, smell contests seem somewhat arbitrary as there are no game mechanics to mask your scent. Feeling the vibrations of hidden creatures with an acute sense of touch already has a specific name: tremorsense. And it's only available to a few creatures. Enemies should be looking for you too with their sense of sight. But being heavily obscured causes any sight-based check to fail automatically, including perception checks. The same argument could be made that sight-based checks wont work if you are completely concealed by physical cover, such as being behind a bend in the cave or a building. No special sense can detect a stealthed creature through solid walls, [even tremorsense.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2018/01/22/can-a-creature-with-tremorsense-locate-player-while-he-is-moving-in-stealth/)

That leaves hearing as the main means of detecting a hidden creature.

Now I know Stealth is left largely in the DM's hand, and when a hidden creature is detected you can roll-play the discovery as coming about by whatever means is most entertaining.

But in a purely *mechanical* sense, thinking of stealth/perception as primarily an auditory contest helps keeps things straight in my mind. It also opens up some interesting realizations:

* Dim light's perception penalties don't really help you hide, as those penalties apply only to sight-based checks and you are already obscured or concealed by full cover. Or just invisible.
* Keen Sight in a creature's stat block won't help them detect you either... but most creatures with keen sight also come equipped with keen hearing or smell so that they still retain their perception bonuses even when they can't see you.
* Environmental effects that create *noise* should do as much, or more, to hinder enemy perception as any effect involving light and darkness.
* All creatures in 5e possess a sense of hearing. So weird overlapping sensory rules involving sight/smell/hearing/blindness basically fall away. If they can hear you clearly, then their perception rolls and passive perception act as normal.
* Sight based perception bonuses and penalties do have a use: observing objects and environmental features.
* This helps keep clear in player's minds that stealth rolls are only about sound. Staying out of sight is a totally different responsibility that isn't covered by the roll.

8 18 13 16 12 10 AC 19 (Studded Leather and +1 shield) Dueling Fighting Style

I'm in a campaign right now with a giant table. We have about eight people on any given night. However, the only tanks are myself and a barbarian. I've gone for the Dex build because I thought of him as an all-rounder initially, but it's become clear over the last two or three levels that the party needs me to be front-line. Pretty much every character is either a caster, an archer, or a squishy rogue/monk, and I'm now regretting not going with a different class. My only effective melee weapon is a rapier, so I pray that my enemies don't have resistance to piercing weapons. I don't love that my only move is ""casting stab,"" (I was hoping that an EK would have spells that would be pretty damaging) but I get a good chunk of RP action thanks to my sage background and my inability to keep secrets.

I've come to terms with my spells and my DM has been helpful in allowing me to switch spells that aren't working. I mostly only use them for reactions and for a familiar. We're going to be hitting 6th level soon, and I'll stay in EK so that I can get the ASI, but I'm thinking about multiclassing afterwards because of how lackluster War Magic seems to be without the SCAG cantrips (which I did not take). I'll ask my DM about using Shocking Grasp with a shield or switching it out for Booming Blade, but I'm not sure I'm invested in it. I definitely don't want to have to take a feat (War Caster) because I ""built the character incorrectly.""

Should I just stick with EK until 10, and multiclass at 11 or should I find another class to get into? If I do mutliclass after 6 levels, what class could I multi into? We have four spellcasters already and we have six if you include the rogue and myself. It seems like Swashbuckler might be ok, but I have 0 Cha so it won't be super helpful for anything other than having advantage more often. I could take a feat to pump wisdom and take some levels in cleric, but I'd rather use something that already works well with my current stats.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an EK that I&amp;#39;m sort of happy to have, but I&amp;#39;m not looking forward to his next few levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goblins, Tritons, Tortle, Dryads, Lizard Folk, Bullywug, the like, make a lot of sense. Maybe some of the gooey Fey races like Boggles, or plant races like Vegepygmy and Myconid. Maybe specifically swampy Treants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Hags might exist in their equivalent of the &amp;#39;shady&amp;#39; part of town where the especially illegal stuff happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was also reading up on a few homebrew races like Swamp Sirens. &lt;strong&gt;I can obviously just find 5e official &lt;a href=""https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Creatures_found_in_freshwater_marshes""&gt;races in swamps on the wiki&lt;/a&gt; but I was wondering if anyone heard of, or could suggest, some ideas for homebrew races that would make this more interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make this unique and not just a sort of Under Dark analogue. &lt;/p&gt;

A barbarian without rage still hits like a truck, a base rogue doesn't really have any limited abilities and dishes out crazy damage and a fighter without action surge... is actually fair. 

Obviously monks have their place on the battlefield, they are extremely mobile and have great CC and can dps race with the best of them... with ki points.

A monk without ki points is a depressingly bad fighter and with how few you get it feels like you'd be asking for a short rest after every single combat or never ever using ki points until you fight a boss. This is too bad, because monks are certainly cool and can out-mobility pretty much any class, but their entire offensive (and cc) power is tied to ki points.

Even warlocks with no spell slots have eldritch blast or in the case of hexblade, bashing people in the face with charisma (or both). Warlocks also get really cool invovations, some of which can be used at will, and monks... get some passives that just sort of help them not die.

I don't want to say that monks are weak, because from what I've seen they can be total monsters... with ki points. Once they run out though it seems like your only option is short rest or be gimped.

Granted, I've never played a monk myself so this is only observation, what I actually want to know is how do people feel about the monk and it's resource management game?

My play style is usually stay away from the monsters more so in the back and be as stealthy as possible while using a longbow with sharpshooter and from time to time using Percision Attack if needed. If I'm not stealthy I'm usually maneuvering around to make it so the Monster doesn't get close at all.

Any help would be great!

**Wish and Whim.** Once per long rest you can duplicate any spell from your class spell list up to a level you can cast or 6th level, whichever is lower. After that spell takes effect, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table for each level of the spell cast.

&amp;#x200B;

It'll be unlocked at about lv 9 (requires attunement) via a yet to be determined prerequisite (maybe dropping to 0 sorcerer points/spell slots?) and should scale later into the game which will go to about lv 15. It's supposed to enhance and embrace the Wild Magic theme but also be of use to other casters should they want/get to use it.

I'm just worried that once a day might be too strong even with the possibility of things going haywire. Maybe limit it to once every couple of days (which is a pain to keep track on)?. I think up to 6th level spells is fun but not gamebreaking and gives some versatility to classes that dont get to prep spells, along with a drawback. It might be a bit convoluted to narrate up to 6 Surges, still not sure about that and haven't thought of a better mechanic that suits the theme. Lastly I'd like the text to sound like something WotC would put out to keep it adequate.

Any ideas appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

We were playing Rise of Tiamat. The party reached the Tomb of Diderius. On the way, we've met some locals who've warned us about ""snake men"" killing and kidnapping people. Long story short, we've discovered a yuan-ti hideout in the caves below the tomb. The entrance was guarded by some lizardfolk. They've attacked us, but were defeated... and spared, because a couple of sessions ago the party had helped another lizardfolk tribe free themselves from the enslavement by the Cult of the Dragon and by a black dragon. So, we've spared those lizardfolk, too. The creatures told us about being enslaved by the yuan-ti and even being occasionally fed to the yuan-ti young. We've promised to free them, and we did.

Skip forward a couple of battles, and we have the yuan-ti high priestess as our prisoner. She begs for mercy and gives up all the hidden treasure. At first, my character (a lawful-good wizard) and another character intend to let her go. Others are  largely indifferent. But then...

I remembered that this nest has been murdering the (innocent) locals and feeding then to the brood. That they've enslaved a tribe of lizardfolk. That they've worshipped Seth, an evil god. That they were yuan-ti, and in the world of Forgotten Realms this race is inherently evil, by its very nature. Because, unlike in Eberron, in Toril mortal races are under strong influence of the gods, and the gods made all the races a certain way, and constantly push them towards certain behaviour. Basically, evil races are evil not because they choose to be, but because of the power of the gods. So they can't choose to stop being evil.

Basically, my character saw that if he'd let the priestess go she would just nurture the baby snakes into new yuan-ti army (feeding many villagers to them in the process) and then resume her worship of Seth, which would inevitably lead to yuan-ti emerging from below and tearing their way through the countryside, killing and enslaving ""worm-bloods"".

So my wizard told the others to execute the priestess and burn the younglings. He chose a coward's way out, too, not participating in the slaughter. He told himself that the little snakes were still non-sapient creatures (which is true), and that this decision would save many innocent lives (which it most likely would).

As a player, I reminded myself about the goblins from ""Goblin Slayer"" anime, and how it was an example of a misplaced mercy backfiring.

Still, I'm torn. Was what we did wrong? Should I change my character's alignment? Is so, how? Was there anything we could've done differently?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, a story for some context:&lt;/p&gt;

# Viewers Questions

* Do you prefer watching people with or without face cameras?
* Does it matter what quality of camera they use?
* If someone is uncomfortable showing their face on camera, would it be acceptable if one of the players doesn't show their face?
* Does a professional stream overlay make a difference?
* What makes an overlay look good to you?
* What makes a stream worth watching to you?
* What annoys you or prevents you from watching a stream?
* What advice would you give to streamers that would make watching them entertaining to you?

**These Questions are specific to me**

* I have a person who uses facerig. Would you watch 4 face cameras and 1 facerig camera?
* How do you feel about watching people play D&amp;D in VR? Such as VRChat, where you see each player in an avatar sitting around a D&amp;D table.
* I can create custom worlds and avatars for VR that would allow me and my players to actually be their characters in VR and actually play through the dungeon i would create. That is a whole lot of prep work for a single session. Would that be something you would like to see happen? Or are you rather indifferent and I shouldn't waste my time?

# Streamer Questions

* Do you interact with your chat during the game or on breaks or at all?
* Do you promote your stream? What success, if any, have you found?
* What is your reason for streaming your D&amp;D game?
* Do you do things differently from other D&amp;D streamers that makes your viewing experience unique?
* How do you deal with player schedule and stream scheduling?
* What streaming advice would you give yourself when you first started out?

&lt;li&gt;How do you feel about watching people play D&amp;amp;D in VR? Such as VRChat, where you see each player in an avatar sitting around a D&amp;amp;D table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can create custom worlds and avatars for VR that would allow me and my players to actually be their characters in VR and actually play through the dungeon i would create. That is a whole lot of prep work for a single session. Would that be something you would like to see happen? Or are you rather indifferent and I shouldn&amp;#39;t waste my time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Streamer Questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you interact with your chat during the game or on breaks or at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you promote your stream? What success, if any, have you found?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your reason for streaming your D&amp;amp;D game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you do things differently from other D&amp;amp;D streamers that makes your viewing experience unique?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you deal with player schedule and stream scheduling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What streaming advice would you give yourself when you first started out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for any assistance in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

So my party will soon head for a Desert city that is highly technologically advanced (they created airships in my world) it is ruled by a Sorcerer-King in an Avatar like process that when one king dies it’s soul is reincarnated into a new body and new person. 

Passed down through generations of these Kings/Queens is the “Primordial Key” a key that connects their body to the elemental chaos and allows them to control the weather and do minor elemental miracles. (Only the Sorcerer-king/queen can attune to the stone and do these miracles)

This item also happens to be an item that can close rifts to the elemental chaos and banish elementals (without attunement) . Which is what the party needs to do for a few BBEGs 

However I’m planning on when they finally get an audience with this King, that it turns out one of the Kings advisors has been impersonating him to keep up charades because the real king has been kidnapped (along with the primordial key). 

Problem I’m having is how do I kidnap the king and create an interesting side adventure. I’ve wondered what creature might do that. 

It should be of note this city has an Oracle that is able to divine prophecies and such, she was able to get a small glimpse of the king before not being able to scry on him again this will give the party a lead to follow.

Currently looking at the following subclasses - the Dreams or Shepherd circle druids and the Archfey warlock. Glamor bard exists but my DM and I have had difficulty navigating an agreement on what would be considered a harmful action for charm and suggestion effects, so unfortunately my original idea of a Wild Sorcerer/Glamor Bard is out the window. So this character, instead of focusing on the glamour-like aspects that figures like Galadriel and Pan have, will instead be focusing on Dryad or Nymph-like qualities of seeming, shapeshifting and a natural/nurturing connection.

So far, my DM has allowed:

* The ability to keep Wild Magic surges, because nothing screams feywild like unpredictable magic. We're both just looking for a decent table to use, if anyone has any suggestions.
* The ability to encounter creatures I could entice into my service with Pact of the Chain, like a faerie dragon instead of a pseudodragon.
* One magic item (with approval) - our rogue, for example, got themselves a set of Bracers of Protection.

&amp;#x200B;

Mechanically I'm kind of struggling to figure out how to build this character. Our party so far consists of a Bladelock, a Sorlock, a Necromancy Wizard, a OoA paladin and a swashbuckler. I'm the only dedicated support our party has, which puts me in a bind for action economy and action efficacy. This leads me to the main deal here - what are the advantages of dream vs shepherd circle? 

Would I be mistaken in saying that dream's advantage being spell conservation and action efficiency through the use of its circle features to replicate spell-like effects (healing word, leomund's, misty step, etc)? As opposed to Shepherd's strategy of overwhelming or controlling the action economy balance through numbers/grappling/damage, etc. with durable, threatening minions? Even faithful summons seems useful when you realize you could potentially Gandalf out of a bad situation with a bunch of giant eagles (or quetzacoatl) to bear you to safer ground.

Shepherd is solid in both theme and crunch, but I feel like summons and playing mechanically well might overwhelm my DM, who is still new to DM'ing and seems scared of his PC's being too powerful, despite throwing several homebrew monsters at us that left us inches from TPK. I've discussed with him the goodberry/unicorn spirit tactic along with the life domain cleric bonuses and he's nix'd it, ruling that it wouldn't work according to the sage advice rulings. Kind of unhappy about that, considering how close we are to dying every single time, but it is what it is.

I really like the theme of the Dreams druid, since I feel like it would fit my intended character's concept more. But when it comes to actually being supportive, and not just healing throughput, how does the Dreams druid really shine? I'm trying to justify a reason to take this circle when shepherd just seems more useful in terms of group healing (where most healers really struggle) and battle control through their summons as effective THP for the party if nothing else.

I&amp;#39;ve discussed with him the goodberry/unicorn spirit tactic along with the life domain cleric bonuses and he&amp;#39;s nix&amp;#39;d it, ruling that it wouldn&amp;#39;t work according to the sage advice rulings. Kind of unhappy about that, considering how close we are to dying every single time, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the theme of the Dreams druid, since I feel like it would fit my intended character&amp;#39;s concept more. But when it comes to actually being supportive, and not just healing throughput, how does the Dreams druid really shine? I&amp;#39;m trying to justify a reason to take this circle when shepherd just seems more useful in terms of group healing (where most healers really struggle) and battle control through their summons as effective THP for the party if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone played with the Circle of Dreams druid to comment?&lt;/p&gt;

Players never fully investigated the mystery despite multiple NPCs subtly telling them what to investigate, and are following something down a dead end instead. Give them more hints, let them hit the dead end, rewrite the story, or something else?

I'm a pretty experienced player, but I'm little more than a novice DM.

I ran a kidnapping story in a play-by-post game which was to be the start of a story arc. The PCs found the victim and easily killed the mini-boss, but got distracted and failed to investigate the lair. After walking away from my clues (and some undiscovered loot) there, they returned the victim to the town watch, but never investigated her story much (missing more clues there). The contact at the watch asked pointed questions about these things, but they didn't take the hint to go find the answers.

OK, they're not real into the mystery. But no - they did want to follow up on this one object they recovered, which I hadn't intended as a clue.

So I made it a little clue. An NPC discussed the object with them, gave them a little info, and *twice* said that he would really like to know more about the kidnapping victim and the lair. They ignored that completely and stayed focused on this object. That's partially my fault; I had the object stolen for reasons related to the larger story, and now they've clearly gotten the idea that this little plot is all about the theft. The nature of the theft makes it unlikely that they'll get anywhere investigating it.

So...do I give them more IC hints on where to investigate? Do I tell them OOC to re-read the NPC interactions for ideas? Do I let them bang their heads against this wall until they're forced to rethink things? Do I rewrite things to make it more productive for them to investigate the theft?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The responses seemed to really run the gamut here; appreciate all the (constructive) input. I'm opting for an NPC to find the clues for them if necessary. I wasn't looking to send a message or anything, but it probably will be a wake-up call when they realize what they left behind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: PBP game.

To review:

- RAW, when you cast any of the ""Conjure ____"" type spells, it gives you a choice between various CR ""tiers"". While this is not stated outright, apparently this means the player/PC picks the CR tier, but the DM picks the actual monster(s) that appear using that tier as a guide.

- Initiative is rolled for whatever is summoned as a group, possibly differing from the caster PC's initiative. If it's higher, the summons will sit around until they go on the next initiative turn.

This is weird and unsatisfying to me for a few reasons:

- The player does not get to experience any of the satisfaction of choosing their own monsters, either for tactical usefulness for the situation at hand, or just if they have a favorite type they want to summon (or even roleplay as if they're summoning the same one each time to interact with).

- Having the monsters roll their own initiative is awkward, random, and slows down the game. Sometimes they'll go right after you for maximal effectiveness, sometimes they'll sit around getting pot-shotted or dispelled or whatever till it's nearly your turn again. Also it's an extra initiative the caster has to roll and keep track of, in addition to the extra set of actions, hp, conditions, etc. they're already going to bookkeep. I know many DMs who just have familiars go on their master's turn for the same reason.

- All together it makes these spells some of the least consistent and trustworthy spells in the book. Which is fine and cool in the case of, say, Conjure Elemental, where when you lose concentration it becomes uncontrollable, displaying the risky nature of summoning rituals! But this is a purely mechanical annoyance.

However, simply removing these restrictions has its own problems. The spells are mad _powerful_ when the player gets to choose and/or when they go on the player's turn right after them. A group of charging elk, pack tactics wolves, or especially the dreaded pixie swarm can obliterate at-level encounters if these restrictions are lifted.

But leaving them in place just feels...bad and dumb. I've had a player retire their PC (a druid) once already because I was running it RAW, and honestly I couldn't blame them. Not getting to pick what you summon is lame. Not getting to use what you summon till almost a full turn later (when it happens) is lame. Taking up even more game time on these rolls and bookkeeping, when summon spells already add more by their very nature, is lame.

So, has anyone come up with a different solution?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious how people are running the various summon spells, because the RAW method has a number of aspects I consider cumbersome or unintuitive, especially for new players.

item rarity: Rare

Requires attunment, proficency carpenters/shipbuilders tools, &amp; proficiency is vehicle being bound

An old rum bottle aproximately 1ft long and 6in diamiter. Floating inside is a ship that looks worn and weathered. Can only be attuned by the riteful captain. When the cork is pulled a message on damp pachment comes out that has a ritual written on it. The ritual is an 8 hour ordeal requiring it be performed on the deck of the owned ship by the Captain, First mate, and Quartermaster (all are optional except the captain). Those who participate in the ritual are bound to the item and can use its powers (only the captain is attuned though).  When the ritual is completed the ship inside looks identical to the vessal bound. Once per day can cast mend via the bottle and will repair all minor damge to the ship, cannot not repair holes larger that 1ft, repair any mast larger than 1ft in thickness, or any other repairs exceeding the peramiters of the mend spell. Any time the captain acquires a new vessal the ritual can be preformed again to bind the new ship or to absorb the new ship into the old binding the 2 ships together. The captain can choose the new layout of the ship based on the 2 ships combined (if a 2 mast 3 deck ship and a 3 mast 3 deck ship are combined then the captain can choose any number of masts and decks up to the total of both combined. This does not change the needed number of crew to sail the ship, so increaseing a ship size increases the needed crew to sail it efficiently), the captain can choose to rework any part of the ship in any dimenstions or artistic design as long as it doesn't exceed the cost of the 2 vessels used. All weapons, personal efects and things not part of the ship are moved to the equivilent room in the new vessel or to the hold if not specified.

This item is just a fluff piece really to allow them to continue to upgrade with out having to abandon and move everything every time they capture a new ship. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Quartermaster&lt;/p&gt;

You can hear the muffled screaming of tortured souls up ahead.

Cleric: I use Detect Good and Evil.

DM: you sense a hell of a ton of undead.

Cleric: is the ground hallowed or desecrated?

DM: uh, yeah it’s desecrated.

Cleric: I will use Detect Magic to discover the spell, am I familiar with it?

DM: You can tel it’s a Hallow spell.

Cleric: a hallow spell you say? 

Dm: yes, but you get a sense that it is far too powerful to dispel.

Cleric: oh, I’m not gonna try to dispel it. Guys, I have a plan. Do you think you could watch my back for a little under half an hour?

Party: yeah sure

DM: what are you trying to do? You’re outside the dungeon gates so you have time to cast something in preparation without attracting any attention. 

The cleric, smiling, takes out a vial of very expensive powered ruby he bought at the last major town.

Cleric: I’m going to cast Forbiddance.

DM: could you please post it in the chat?

The Cleric posts the spell and the DM realizes he’s made a terrible mistake.

DM: well, it can’t be that bad. You used your only 6th level spell slot for the day.

Cleric: it’s a ritual, my dude.

The DM realizes it’s too late to renege and the cleric finishes casting.

Suddenly, every single undead in that dungeon starts to get seared with radiant magic every 6 seconds, completely oblivious to the intruders outside.

The smarter creatures teleport out before being completely torn apart, in an attempt to summon reinforcements, unaware that they can’t return to the dungeon after leaving for the next 24 hours, and by that time, the adventurers are far gone.

The party then proceeds to go through the dungeon to the McGuffin, avoiding any encounters as bodies of undead litter the ground. The DM strongly regrets making all the dungeon’s inhabitants undead.

Obviously, this scenario is probably never going to happen the way this played out, but the point stands that with it’s huge area, it can completely obliterate every Fiend/Elemental/Undead/Fey that’s already inside of the area before they have a chance to react. Heck, even Celestials would be affected, they’d just die slower. There is only one creature in the official sources that is downright immune to radiant damage, and that’s the Skulk which is a CR 1/2 humanoid, which wouldn’t be affected by the spell regardless.

Flying creatures can escape it as it only effects up to 30 feet in the air, but inside a dungeon environment creatures won’t have that liberty.

A very easy way to counter this is by stating that 
there already is a Forbiddance spell in the area, but if the DM doesn’t think to explicitly state there is one, it means that the damage can be catastrophic. 

Other counters include spell-casters with 6th level Dispel Magic in the area. However, if there aren’t any, unless the DM pulls stuff out of thin air, this can completely bypass a big portion of an adventure. 

The fact that the materials aren’t consumed upon use and it’s a ritual also increase its potential use. Also, since it’s a Cleric spell, all they need to do is prepare it, since unlike Arcane spell casters, they have access to every single spell on their list that they can swap around each long rest.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;DM: after your several day journey into the jungle, you come across the entrance to the lost city of the undead.

I’m starting to plan a campaign that I’d like to run from 1-20 and recently I’ve been wondering how to solve the “problem” of death for higher-level characters being nearly negligible as soon as they have a level 5 Cleric (or access to one). Barring restricting the amount of diamonds/diamond dust available to the players, I feel like the overall threat level to the characters drops significantly once they cross the resurrection power threshold into Tier 2.

Does the following system sound too restrictive, or like I’m adding too much of a punishment for dying? Basically, I figure that every time a character dies and is resurrected, one of their death saves is permanently filled in. After their first resurrection it only takes 2 failed saves to die. After a 2nd time, only a single failed death save will kill them. Then finally, after a 3rd resurrection, they’ll die permanently if they even hit 0 HP. 

Basically, every time they die, they leave a little piece of themselves behind and fate won’t let them escape death forever. It’s also a good reason for adventurer NPCs to have retired before they themselves reached the absolute height of power.

Finally, I’m also wondering if it would be more interesting to tell this to the players at session 0, or to just tell them that I have homebrewed rules for death and resurrection and that they’ll find out what the rules are after someone’s resurrected.

I chose paladin cause then i could heal and tank but they all seem to want to be the front line and so its not really needed. But i dont want to take over a role that they will come into as they become more experienced.

In a universe adjacent to our own lies a world known as Runia. This world, once peaceful and idyllic, is now threatened by a monstrous being from its prehistory. A group of adventurers known as Whiskey Company have risen up to do what they can to fight this entity known only as Nagat. They have trekked far across the mortal realms in search of the shards of Barrinoth, the Titan of Justice, in hopes of returning him to his full power.

Now bound into the service of Lizeth, the Emissary of the Raven Queen, they prepare for the next leg of their journey. Their goal is to locate Robert Mormesk, a legend of the Millennium War and the husband of Lizeth, and free him from the grip of the Hells. The group is embarking on a journey to the Nine Hells in in search of the legendary warrior Robert Mormesk at the behest of the Iron Rose, but first they must make their way through the Astral Sea.

Having planned out the design of their new ship, Whiskey Company sets forth to acquire some magical shielding for their new ship just in case... The crew is on a hunt for one last component of their ship, but what will they have to do to get it? Join us on our adventure though the planes! Our adventure continues tonight at midnight EDT.

You channel magical energy around you and steel your will. You then dive ,using your entire body, towards a creature  You can only cast this spell when you are 30ft in the air. Chose a creature you can see within the spells range. You dive towards it and deal damage in a 10-foot line centered on the creature, you can choose the angle of the line. Every creature in the area must pass a Dexterity Saving Throw equal to your spellsave DC. If they fail, you deal 6d6 damage of a damage type of your choosing, if they pass the spell only deals half damage.   You receive half of the damage rolled as recoil unless you pass a DC 12 Dex Save, if you succed you only receive 1/4th of the damage rolled.  You are moved 5 ft behind the original target area.  


**At higher levels:**  
The damage increases by 2d6 for every level above 1st. Should this spell be used at 3rd level or higher and the recoil would put you under 0 hp *you instantly die*/ for every 2 levels above 1st the spell adds one failed death save if you hit 0 through the spells recoil.  For every Level above 1st the Dex Save for the recoil goes up by one.

Currently, rules-as-written, if you are concentrating on Spell A and casting Spell B, if Spell B requires concentration, then you immediately lose Spell A.

This is frustrating if you only wanted to cast Spell B for its ""instant"" effect (usually damage), and not to keep it active afterwards. So it seems like losing the concentration on Spell A is too high of a price to pay, considering you almost certainly won't get the full effect of Spell B anyways.

For example: Let's say that your druid is currently concentrating on [Barkskin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/barkskin), a buff spell that they want to keep focusing on. They are in combat and they want to cast a damaging spell on an enemy, but the highest-damage spell they have is [Wall of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire).

Under my suggested houserule, the druid could cast Wall of Fire ""momentarily"", dealing 5d8 fire damage to anyone inside it and then removing it right away (and not keeping it on the battlefield to deal any more damage), while still keeping their Barkskin. It doesn't make sense that the Druid has to resort to Cantrips even though they clearly have a more powerful spell to cast, just because it's a spell that only in other situations would have been useful to keep concentrating on.

My reasoning for this is that, as far as I've seen, all Concentration spells either have no immediate effect or a weak immediate effect (for example, compare [Wall of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire) to [Fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball), which is 1 spell-level lower yet deals more damage (5.5 extra, on average).

Thoughts? Is there some Concentration spell with instant effects that are too good for this to be allowed to happen?

(Clarification - by ""immediate effect"" I only mean the effects that happen right as you cast the spell. If the effect only happens when you spend a bonus action, or on your next attack, or ""for the spell's duration"" - it's not immediate)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to know if the following house-rule is fair and not broken or exploitable somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

He made a ruling and we went with it. All is well. Just curious about the groupthink of all the RAWyers out here.

In general: if a creature is affected by prone but no other condition, does inflicting forced movement cancel the prone condition?

Specifically, we were fighting gargoyles in a room such that they are standing inactive next to a big hole and we have devised from the room how to activate them one by one. For each gargoyle, we set up a plan for everybody to do damage as an opening volley as we activate the gargoyle, then before it gets its first turn off our two frontliners use their last few attacks to knock the gargoyle prone (so its speed is 0 and it can’t fly) and shove it into the hole. Does the gargoyle get to start flying as it is shoved over the hole, or does it fall? The two competing theories were:

(A) the prone condition is a condition, and its mechanical effects do not end unless something happens that explicitly says they do (such as the garg spending half its movement to get up). Therefore, it would fall and be subject to fall damage.

(B) The gargoyle was prone on the floor, but since it was pushed off the floor that instance of the prone condition no longer applies. The gargoyle can then begin flying and requires a separate prone application to cause it to fall.

(C) It’s not realistic that the gargoyle would automatically have no chance to right itself before it hit the ground (I’m not sure how far the fall was), so it can have a dex save to see whether it can right itself and, if so, how far it falls before that happens.

I’m aware that for both B and C, we can (and indeed, we did!) just reverse the order of our shove/prone attacks. Still curious what others think about this in theory, and if there is any obvious rule I have missed in my own consideration.

&lt;p&gt;The game is point buy and we all get a free feat at first level (the DM banned variant human). Any mechanical advice is much appreciated, especially, as I know Mearls&amp;#39; patron can be a bit weird. &lt;/p&gt;

I’m looking for some help turning a character concept I have into a viable build. It’s an interesting concept, but I am having trouble nailing down class and build. Or… more specifically a class and build most DMs will go for. 

Concept: A Chimera. A creature made by a mad scientist that is the distillation of many different animals. Normally, they look like a small fox, but they are sentient and can morph their body to adapt to different situations. I would like the build to focus around this ability.

Now, the perfect class for this is a Mystic that only focuses on the Immortal order. With its disciplines, you can have the character morph their body to have gills, larger, eyes, tougher skin, or larger claws. They can increase their strength, speed, or size, and spit venom or even have acidic blood. Every skill would focus on changing or adapting the body in a verity of ways. You would have to ignore almost all of the other Mystic orders as calling fourth walls of fire, or teleportation don’t really fit the theme of this build. The problem is, as many of you know, many DMs will not touch a Mystic with a 10 foot poll. I would also hesitate to let a player at my table build an unrestricted Mystic because of their insane versatility and a few broken combos (Anyone ever shrink down to the size of a gnat and then mind blast villains silently, so they have no chance of even knowing where to retaliate?) While I think restricting the Mystic to just one order like my proposed build solves most of the issues with a Mystic, a lot of DMs still would not green light it. So! I need other options!

One obvious class would be the Moon Circle druid. If you focus on wild shaping, you can pretty much achieve the same concept, except it is less about adapting your body and more about straight turning into other animals. However, there are a few issues with this type of build some of you may be able to offer insight on.  
 The animal cannot talk in the normal way. Being a ghostwise gnome for the base race would at least allow it to communicate with the other players though telepathy, but spell casting would be almost impossible. A Druid that can’t cast spells, even a Moon circle sub class, is shooting themselves in the foot. To be honest, even if the DM allowed the animal to cast spells, it doesn’t really fit the theme. The focus should be on morphing the body, not casting sun beam. You can use your spell slots to heal animal forms, and that’s nifty, but still makes for a far weaker druid than one that casts spells. Maybe multiclass? Barbarian for rage? How would you build a wild shaping druid who does not cast spells?

Are there any other classes/multiclasses, that are not straight homebrew, that could work? I am no power gamer, and I do not mind bringing a character to the table that is far from optimized. However, I do not want to bring a character that is so hamstrung it brings the rest of the party down.

I am looking for advice on how to use the Couatl intelligently. It will be used to overthrow and replace the crime syndicates of a major city while my character is off adventuring. I can obtain it through Planar Binding + Conjure Celestial. (I am currently deciding my 14th level Magical Secrets for my Bard. The purpose of this post is to help me see how effective the Couatl can be. *Please dont worry about the alignment of the Couatl or its willingness to participate.*)

The Couatl is immune to damage from non magical weapons, meaning that it can easily defeat most henchmen. It can scry, detect thoughts, and shape change making it perfect for subterfuge. It can assassinate people through Dream should it so choose, and it can use that same spell to send me updates while my PC sleeps. It can play very similarly to Lazav from MtG, if anyone is aware of him and his stat block from GGtR. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how best to use this creature? What combat forms are most useful?

Bard's *Jack of all Trades* lets you **add** half of your proficiency bonus to any ability check that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus, such as Initiative (Dexterity) checks, and Counterspell.

Rogue's *Reliable Talent* essentially means when you make an ability check that ""lets you **add** your proficiency bonus"", you can't roll lower than a 10 on the d20.

Say you took Arcane Trickster as your Roguish Archetype, and at 14th Level (or 13th if you swap out your 8th level spell), you took Counterspell. You then take two levels in Bard to get Jack of All Trades.

RAW is weird about it, because the two features have opposing triggers: Reliable Talent triggers for ability checks you are proficient with, Jack of All Trades triggers for ability checks you are NOT proficient with, but the latter lets you add half your proficiency bonus, seemingly triggering Reliable Talent via the wording in Reliable Talent (hence quotation marks).

I'm all for things being broken, but just for the lulz, here's how **hilarious** this is:

A level 15-16 Rogue (Arcane Trickster) / Bard, that knows Counterspell, with an Intelligence of 20 (+5), **cannot roll lower than a 17 on a Counterspell check**, if these two abilities stack. Spells of 7th level or lower are automatically Counterspelled even if you were to cast Counterspell at its lowest level. When you reach 17th level and your proficiency bonus goes up, this now applies to spells of 8th level or lower, meaning that the only spells you would have to roll for are 9th level spells.

(You would also achieve roughly the same thing at level 17 but with more slots with a level division of Bard 6/Rogue 11 if you choose Lore Bard and Arcane Trickster as your archetypes, but the former division gives you the crazy counterspell check sooner so either one has pros/cons.)

More so than mundane skill checks (because never rolling lower than a 13 on any skill check isn't really that big of a deal at level 17 anyway i mean really), this is probably why JC clarified that the two abilities DON'T interact. If they did, Bard/Rogue would Counter virtually any spell thrown its way, unless Counterspelled itself. A smart caster would know to Counterspell the Counterspell IMO, and an Arcane Trickster/Bard doesn't have that many 3rd level slots, so it's not completely broken, but it's pretty ding dang close.

Personally, I'm all about players being awesome, and Spellcasting BBEG's get all the love. Why not a Monk BBEG, or a Barbarian BBEG? Martial classes can be nasty too, and you don't need spells to be threatening. If your party Counterspeller is locking down your spellcasters, either throw more spellcasters at them or hit them with something that doesn't cast spells. alternatively, the player spent 16 levels building up to this cool idea, let them be cool. 

I get that JC recently clarified the two abilities don't work together, but it's your game and if you like it that they do then that's rad and you're a nice person &lt;3. So your party has a skill monkey with a ridiculous Counterspell, so what? You, the DM, have the ability to change literally anything and everything about the game to make it more challenging without taking stuff away from the players. You could just give your god-tier Vecna-like multiple reactions to Counterspell the Counterspell with, or the ability to cast a spell as a legendary action to force your Counterspeller to choose its moment, just a few examples off the top of my head.

Plus it gives you an opportunity to think outside the box with your Big Bads. I mean, you can't exactly Counterspell Tiamat, but I had this cool idea about an insane gnomish inventor who built a giant clockwork mecha and goes on a rampage.

Bit of backstory, The Legend of Dragoon was a bad ass game released back on the PS1. If you haven't heard of it or played it I would highly recommend it. I wouldn't say it is ground breaking or award winning, but it is a good game, you will probably like it, and I am adapting it to D&amp;D 5e. I have played the game dozens of times. I know the whole game like the back of my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

For those that know of the game and are excited to read that someone is adapting it to D&amp;D here are some of the key points

Dragoons as a bonus class are a thing.

Dragoon spirits, while not necessarily awakened when found will give bonus damage of their element for 1 min to the user of said Dragoon Spirit. This will hopefully entice the players not to forget/sell/give away a Dragoon Spirit before it is revealed what they can do

Since Dart doesn't exist in the campaign as his role is being played out by the player party. I figure I can have Fire Bird watch over the Red Eye Dragoon Spirit, and hopefully some player will be happy to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the skills are a bit overpowered, so I am tweaking the class a bit, but overall a lot is going to be left unchanged.

2 things off the top of my head that will change is, the player will expend exhaustion points to gain SP, however they are not affected by exhaustion while in dragoon form. This can create a dynamic where a player can decide to dump a ton of points into SP to transform and save the party, but at the cost of his own life when the transformation expires. This also may mean there are 6 total SP available not the recommended 4. Although powerful transformations lasting up to 1 min is pretty standard for DnD so I like it. The second change is that, rather than summoning your dragon type to your aid for the durration your SP allows, it will simply act as another spell, much like the playstation game did. Your dragon type shows up, does a thing, and leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to have 4 players in the party as this will be first time as a DM and more will be crazy.

I plan to have Lavitz, Albert, Rose, and Shana, as re-occurring characters that join the party, just to nudge them in the right direction. This may change as things progress.

Lavitz may never actually become a dragoon, simply because I don't want the players to get pissed when they slay a dragon and a DM-PC gets the reward. Shana is special in her own way, Rose is already a dragoon, Lavitz...well. And Albert may not join the party at all, he may just stay a king of newly united Serdio

&amp;#x200B;

Rose will be a Hexblade Warlock

Lavitz/Albert a polearm wielding paladin

Shana a ranger

&amp;#x200B;

Dart and his quest for the black monster does not exist, but the phantom ship will, so Rose will still be the black monster in the end. But no PC will be directly affected by it, unless their backstory deems it so. The town of Neet and the Phantom ship will still be products of Roses work, and she may be in the party during those times to give a bit of foreshadowing.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I hope this works well, if anyone else has some questions or concerns that I may run into with this campaign please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit of backstory, The Legend of Dragoon was a bad ass game released back on the PS1. If you haven&amp;#39;t heard of it or played it I would highly recommend it. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it is ground breaking or award winning, but it is a good game, you will probably like it, and I am adapting it to D&amp;amp;D 5e. I have played the game dozens of times. I know the whole game like the back of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that know of the game and are excited to read that someone is adapting it to D&amp;amp;D here are some of the key points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragoons as a bonus class are a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragoon spirits, while not necessarily awakened when found will give bonus damage of their element for 1 min to the user of said Dragoon Spirit. This will hopefully entice the players not to forget/sell/give away a Dragoon Spirit before it is revealed what they can do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Dart doesn&amp;#39;t exist in the campaign as his role is being played out by the player party. I figure I can have Fire Bird watch over the Red Eye Dragoon Spirit, and hopefully some player will be happy to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrowed from another redditor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rx6ytwz18v7dnz/_DnD-Dragoon-additive-class-rulebook_v2.pdf?dl=0""&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rx6ytwz18v7dnz/_DnD-Dragoon-additive-class-rulebook_v2.pdf?dl=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/legendofdragoon/comments/7fmhfl/legend_of_dragoon_dd_campaign_setting_sharing_my/dqcx6lp/?context=3""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/legendofdragoon/comments/7fmhfl/legend_of_dragoon_dd_campaign_setting_sharing_my/dqcx6lp/?context=3&lt;/a&gt;He also created some really good maps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/do9lrp9iio6waz6/AAAQQpdV4hV_RM1KIWf5om6ka?dl=0""&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/do9lrp9iio6waz6/AAAQQpdV4hV_RM1KIWf5om6ka?dl=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the skills are a bit overpowered, so I am tweaking the class a bit, but overall a lot is going to be left unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 things off the top of my head that will change is, the player will expend exhaustion points to gain SP, however they are not affected by exhaustion while in dragoon form. This can create a dynamic where a player can decide to dump a ton of points into SP to transform and save the party, but at the cost of his own life when the transformation expires. This also may mean there are 6 total SP available not the recommended 4. Although powerful transformations lasting up to 1 min is pretty standard for DnD so I like it. The second change is that, rather than summoning your dragon type to your aid for the durration your SP allows, it will simply act as another spell, much like the playstation game did. Your dragon type shows up, does a thing, and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the campaign itself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaign write up WIP&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously one of the biggest choices for most gishes is what you spend your concentration on. Now given the level range we tend to play in (around 5-10), I reckon there are three compelling choices (though obviously I would be interested to hear more)

&amp;#x200B;

* Shadow blade. Pro: nice damage boost, especially upcast; advantage on attacks in dim light is widely applicable. Con: doesn't work with magic weapons (which is obviously campaign dependent); bonus action set-up conflicts with bladesong.
* Haste. Pro: a slew of useful side-benefits, +AC is great in particular given how high you can push it with bladesong. Con: worse damage than shadow blade; loss of concentration is punishing.
* Greater Invisibility: amazing benefits, disadvantage to be attacked in particular reduces the number of crits which are a bladesinger's bane. Con: completely shut down by true sight; lower damage (I think?) but more consistent.

I'm PantherophisNiger; one of the mods over at r/DnDBehindTheScreen.

For the last month, I've been taking in submissions for an item compendium to supplement the items in the DMG.

I spent ~6 hours/day for 12 days (basically my entire spring break) compiling and editing this 65-page document.

##[Here it is!](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Laa4RuYNr6fcDthHyT1)

##[Here's a PDF download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s1Tpzo_Cb1su-cYx4l8abnEN1UKWsdZq)


Please note that if there are display errors with the online version, you should probably download the PDF. Some test audiences could not make the online version display properly.


All of these items have been edited for compatibility with 5e. I can't promise that they are balanced; just that they are worded in terms of 5e mechanics.

If you find that there are typos, wording errors, or that there is some kind of weird exploit with an item, I'd love to hear about it!

This is an ongoing project that will receive *sparse* updates for the next two months.

However, come June/July (when I have more free time), I will begin accepting a second round of item submissions.

If you are an OP that submitted an item, please see my thread over on BTS.

***Now for my shill***

We over at r/DnDBehindTheScreen are a community that is dedicated to curating an extensive archive of quality DM resources. We encourage new submitters to bring us their completed OC dungeons, adventures, encounters, mechanics, NPC lists, and our favorite... Lore.

We would love for you to join us over there!

Other posters also included Deception into this discussion. 

I want to talk about this, but also touch on player agency and the granularity of 5e in general. 

The short version is that I agree with that post: these skills are very, very similar. I also find it strange that in 5e's very simplified environment, that they're separate. 

Consider that History, Arcana, and Medicine are one skill each. A historian is equally versed in military history, elven history, political history, trivia, and seafarer legends. An expert on Arcana is versed in the magic of all classes, of all schools, even if they personally specialize in only one. A sawbones in Forgotten Realms knows how to work on every race, every animal, and knows all the remedies for every ailment (though not how to make them, that's herbalist). 

But if you're a con man or a politician, you need to have three seperate skills, all of which produce the same result, but differ only in their approach. 

A doctor needs one skill. A fast talking merchant needs to invest 3 slots.

For a game that has as stripped down mechanics as 5e and also has very large umbrella skills that seems a little incongruous with design principles. 

This is before we get into the fact that social skills in D&amp;D are basically what the GM lets them be. Every skill is like that, to some extent, but some less so. Medicine, again, has a very specific effect: it allows you to stabilize a character who is making death saves. Persuasion allows you to influence a character. And that's far more tricky and nebulous. 

Say you have a prison guard. It's really, really unlikely that you're going to talk him into just letting you go. You could, however, convince him to come closer so you could get in an attack or to start slipping you contraband in the long game, but even the latter is only if he's inclined to be immoral. All of that may actually be better accomplished, from a fun factor, via role play in any case. 

Spells like Friends or Dominate Person are very cut an dry in what they do. What you can lie, threaten, or sweet talk someone into doing, though, is entirely up to the gm. I've seen GM's just straight up say ""no"" to even simple fast talk possibilities, under the reasoning that the request is simply beyond the NPC's set of desires.

EDIT: This also doesn't include that there is a lot of overlap in concept which leads to some strange mechanical interaction. If a person using Persuasion uses an implied threat while being mostly positive, is it also intimidation? If omits a bit of the truth, is it also Deception? If I make an empty threat, do I effectively give the player disadvantage by making them roll both Intimidate and Deception? 

I get that a single roll shouldn't wreck the story, but if the system is going to require a heavy skill investment to be effective, then it seems that when the opportunity arises to employ that skillset, a flat refusal or negligible effect might invalidate an entire character concept. 

Now part of that is knowing the kind of game your GM runs and remembering that social skills aren't, in fact, mind control. They're about turning something from red to orange, not white to black, so to speak. But still, if social interaction is part of the scenario, the person playing the face should have some reasonable expectation that they have a chance of affecting the outcome of events, especially if they're good at all of the things required. 

The only other place in the game that I see this kind of over granular approach to a feature is splitting up the Herablist Kit, Alchemist's Supplies, and the Poisoner's Kit into three separate proficiencies when each item only really makes one or three things practically (counting poisons as one option), which again is strange for the design concepts of 5e. 

This is not to say that persuasion, intimidation, and deception aren't three different things or that being good at one means you're likely good at the other two, only that for as general as most 5e skills are, the scope of the three social skills seems really narrow.

I think we could probably roll either Deception or Intimidation into Persuasion and that would be in improvement (and a small boon to Bards and Rogues). I understand I am in the minority on this opinion, but it would at least make things more consistent. 

What do you think?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b7zx2j/am_i_off_my_nut_or_are_intimidation_and/""&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; (which got mostly downvoted into obscurity) asked if Persuasion and Intimidation were basically the same thing.

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: This also doesn&amp;#39;t include that there is a lot of overlap in concept which leads to some strange mechanical interaction. If a person using Persuasion uses an implied threat while being mostly positive, is it also intimidation? If omits a bit of the truth, is it also Deception? If I make an empty threat, do I effectively give the player disadvantage by making them roll both Intimidate and Deception? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that a single roll shouldn&amp;#39;t wreck the story, but if the system is going to require a heavy skill investment to be effective, then it seems that when the opportunity arises to employ that skillset, a flat refusal or negligible effect might invalidate an entire character concept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now part of that is knowing the kind of game your GM runs and remembering that social skills aren&amp;#39;t, in fact, mind control. They&amp;#39;re about turning something from red to orange, not white to black, so to speak. But still, if social interaction is part of the scenario, the person playing the face should have some reasonable expectation that they have a chance of affecting the outcome of events, especially if they&amp;#39;re good at all of the things required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other place in the game that I see this kind of over granular approach to a feature is splitting up the Herablist Kit, Alchemist&amp;#39;s Supplies, and the Poisoner&amp;#39;s Kit into three separate proficiencies when each item only really makes one or three things practically (counting poisons as one option), which again is strange for the design concepts of 5e. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that persuasion, intimidation, and deception aren&amp;#39;t three different things or that being good at one means you&amp;#39;re likely good at the other two, only that for as general as most 5e skills are, the scope of the three social skills seems really narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we could probably roll either Deception or Intimidation into Persuasion and that would be in improvement (and a small boon to Bards and Rogues). I understand I am in the minority on this opinion, but it would at least make things more consistent. &lt;/p&gt;

I've just started GMing my first ever campaign and am having a great time creating a detailed homebrew with lots of great history, cultures, NPCs, and an intricate overarching plot of evil forces seeking world domination.

I am playing with three close friends, one I've played with many times, one has played lots but not with us, and one new player.

From the beginning I encouraged them to come up with very detailed backstories and character choices that we could discuss and fit into the fabric of my universe. They did a great job with this, but I'm afraid their deep-rooted character motives are not allowing them to gel as a party and work as a team to combat the primary evil.

The new player is playing an old stubborn Dwarf Monk, lawful good and righteously so, who pictures himself as the leader as he has a large reputation in several cities and his home city was the epicenter for the campaign.

The second player who I've played with before decided to roll an evil Tiefling Warlock who is involved with shady business and often sees fit to murder those in her way. The first time she has played an evil character and the first time I've seen one in a party.

The third player who is quite experienced created a Halfling bard who is a bit of a wild card, and whose humorous behavior sometimes smooths over tense interactions.

Though I've tried to give each character a strong  personal connection to the plot, I'm not succeeding at having them overcome their inherent differences and work together. They are all proud and unyielding in their personalities. They've tried snatching things out of each others' hands, deceiving one another, etc. and it feels bad letting your PCs roll against eachother when you want them to be working as a team.

Last night the party was spending time in a large city full of corruption and hints about the evils at large. The bard was taking her time, as she often does, having long conversations with numerous NPCs in persuit of her own artistic aspirations. I enjoy improvising these interactions and allowing her to speak to whomever she would like, whether or not I already had an NPC in mind, but perhaps there is a way to limit the time we spend on these side conversations without stifling her curious play style too much... That's more of a side thought!

The real trouble last night was when the Warlock and the Monk were questioning a shady NPC for information. The NPC was rude, threatened the two PCs, and was generally unpleasant, but did cough up the information for them. He then proceeded to do a line of cackle powder that the Warlock gave him (a narcotic I invented) and when he passed out the Warlock mercy killed him in front of the Monk. The Monk thought for a moment and then said to the Warlock ""You're no longer part of the mission."" They then, once again, went their separate ways and continued hacking at the plot by themselves.

I had a chance to speak with the player of the Warlock afterwards and she, rightfully so, felt pretty hurt about how it all went down. She tried to stay true to her character and now believes the best option is to have this character leave the ""party"" and to roll an new more agreeable character.  

From my perspective I feel I have totally failed as a GM to facilitate an enjoyable group dynamic and a game wherein the characters all feel safe to be themselves and at least tolerate the idea of working together in this campaign.

I'm pretty beat up about it as I have put so much work and love into the world and feel it's my fault for letting this happen.

Any and all words of wisdom would be appreciated!

Thanks,

BnF

Pretty new to the game, and I can safely say I'd like to stick with utility unless there's a powerful reason to take something else -- javelins can work fine for ranged attacks it feels, and it'd be great to have a weightier role outside of combat. My other idea was to take a fighter with the same feat, but that ultimately felt like it wasn't capitalizing on their strengths. Also not really into multiclassing -- give me those sweet, sweet capstone wings of destructive glory.

&amp;#x200B;

I should add I'm not completely married to the Paladin -- my party consists of a Warlock, Ranger and Cleric, and if there are any other classes that would synergize well here I would absolutely love to hear about them.

&lt;p&gt;Pretty new to the game, and I can safely say I&amp;#39;d like to stick with utility unless there&amp;#39;s a powerful reason to take something else -- javelins can work fine for ranged attacks it feels, and it&amp;#39;d be great to have a weightier role outside of combat. My other idea was to take a fighter with the same feat, but that ultimately felt like it wasn&amp;#39;t capitalizing on their strengths. Also not really into multiclassing -- give me those sweet, sweet capstone wings of destructive glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should add I&amp;#39;m not completely married to the Paladin -- my party consists of a Warlock, Ranger and Cleric, and if there are any other classes that would synergize well here I would absolutely love to hear about them. What do you think -- some of the most interesting uses of Magic Initiate that focus on utility?&lt;/p&gt;

Its background is fairly simple: the dungeon is a military keep that was ""lost"" during an extraplanar event and now exists in both the Ethereal and Shadow planes. From a mapping standpoint, I am essentially using [Pillar of Eternity's Raedric's Hold](https://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Raedric%27s_Hold), with some [minor modifications](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon). The party is entering the keep in search of an artifact and they know there is some powerful evil entity trapped within the keep. In order to navigate the keep's two versions, they will be given one or more items to allow them to swap back and forth.

The version in the Ethereal is as the keep was just before this event shunted it out of the Material. There are ghosts of former occupants in this version, as well as traps that were set by people trying to prevent the great evil from escaping. Enemies in this version are relatively easy to deal with. The catch is that this version regenerates after a short period of time. Enemies will respawn, traps will reset, doors will relock, and any damage done to the environment will repair.

The version in the Shadow is a dark mirror of the original keep that has been subjected to magical entropic effects. Some walls are missing segments or are damaged while previously permanent magical effects are often suppressed or unreliable. This side is more easily traversible, but dangerous denizens of the plane have taken up residence within, making the combat more hazardous than the other side. Things here do not respawn or reset.

The goal with these two versions is to create an experience where the players need to swap back and forth between the Ethereal and the Shadow to fully navigate the keep, akin to [Titanfall 2's Effect and Cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KntBgBOdeU) and [Dishonored 2's A Crack in the Slab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_JKT2rHg50), just without actual time travel. A Crack in the Slab, in particular, provides something I want to focus on: player agency. Dishonored 2, in general, allows the player to decide how they want to overcome obstacles put before them. I want to replicate that kind of approach with this dungeon instead of requiring only specific solutions (but having one or two specific solutions is not out of the question if enough information can be provided to make it a puzzle of sorts).

So here's the kind of help I'm looking for:

1. What sorts of obstacles can I place that would allow for *multiple* kinds of solutions?

2. What sort of [systemic design choices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpAAX9CkIc) can I make to enable sandbox-style problem solving?

3. How should the plane shifting ability work? For instance, can only one person use it at a time? Does it have a cooldown before it can be activated again?

4. What are some rules abuses you can think of that might trivialize this dungeon and how would you patch those holes?

5. Have I already mentioned anything you feel is problematic? How might you fix such a problem?

6. What other cool things can you think of that might make this dungeon memorable?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatively soon, my party will be exploring a dungeon that I want to make particularly interesting and I could use some help.

Enemies will respawn, traps will reset, doors will relock, and any damage done to the environment will repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version in the Shadow is a dark mirror of the original keep that has been subjected to magical entropic effects. Some walls are missing segments or are damaged while previously permanent magical effects are often suppressed or unreliable. This side is more easily traversible, but dangerous denizens of the plane have taken up residence within, making the combat more hazardous than the other side. Things here do not respawn or reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal with these two versions is to create an experience where the players need to swap back and forth between the Ethereal and the Shadow to fully navigate the keep, akin to &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KntBgBOdeU""&gt;Titanfall 2&amp;#39;s Effect and Cause&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_JKT2rHg50""&gt;Dishonored 2&amp;#39;s A Crack in the Slab&lt;/a&gt;, just without actual time travel. A Crack in the Slab, in particular, provides something I want to focus on: player agency. Dishonored 2, in general, allows the player to decide how they want to overcome obstacles put before them. I want to replicate that kind of approach with this dungeon instead of requiring only specific solutions (but having one or two specific solutions is not out of the question if enough information can be provided to make it a puzzle of sorts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the kind of help I&amp;#39;m looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sorts of obstacles can I place that would allow for &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; kinds of solutions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sort of &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpAAX9CkIc""&gt;systemic design choices&lt;/a&gt; can I make to enable sandbox-style problem solving?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How should the plane shifting ability work? For instance, can only one person use it at a time? Does it have a cooldown before it can be activated again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are some rules abuses you can think of that might trivialize this dungeon and how would you patch those holes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have I already mentioned anything you feel is problematic? How might you fix such a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What other cool things can you think of that might make this dungeon memorable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I've been away doing Army stuff for the last 4 months with no one to talk about D&amp;D with, so this may be a bunch of rambling and over thinking... You've been warned.

It's been a very long time since I've been able to play as a character in D&amp;D, as I am always the DM, and I've chosen to play the almighty Bard.  Our party consists of me on bard (undecided), rogue (assassin), druid (moon druid), paladin (undecided tank), cleric (life), and ranger (undecided) and we will be starting at level 5 tomorrow.  I can't see playing any other archetype besides lore because it's so damn good, but two features of College of Glamour caught my eye.  

The Mantle of Inspiration feature for your bonus action not only gives you temporary HP, but also gives you the ability to reposition via a reaction to move your full movement speed and not take attacks of opportunity for all the ranged (Currently me, rogue, and ranger countering disadvantage on attacks for being within 5 feet of creature).  If you get to take a short rest twice a day you get 15 uses of inspiration which is the equivalent of 600 temporary HP (5 targets, 8 temp hp, 15 times) (1050 at level 15) this is not including the spell catnap which lets you take a short rest in 10 minutes.  I know all of that temporary hp won't be used and it will be overlapped for some characters, but reducing incoming damage by mitigation is far more effective then using a spell slot to try and heal the damage taken.  It also allows for any melee that are getting destroyed to back up from a situation and get healed or be able to re-engage a threat that got past them.  I think this has to be one of the most powerful uses for inspiration in the game it eliminates one of the biggest mechanics in D&amp;D that stop people from moving during combat which is actually part of a feat called mobile and could come in clutch in so many situations. 

The second feature is Unbreakable Majesty seems like an incredible way to burn an enemies legendary resistances and avoid the massive late game damage creatures can do for the price of a single bonus action.  They have to make a save before they can even hit you, much like the spell sanctuary, and if they do manage to hit you they have disadvantage on any saving throw they make against your spells on your next turn.  I can only think of one other feature off the top of my head that gives disadvantage against spells and it's the shadow magic sorcerers Hound of Ill Omen which costs 3 sorcery points, a bonus action, and is very easy to kill with 37 hp and 14 ac as it doesn't scale well at all.  

Now I know cutting words is amazing mitigation because it can cause a hit to miss, but Mantle of Inspiration is mitigation for the entire team not just one attack on one party member.  Additional magic secrets at level 6 for counterspell (I also take healing spirit because it's really good) and then being able to use the level 14 feature peerless skill to add inspiration dice to the counterspell check is a ridiculous combo that makes it so you don't have to up cast counterspell ever in fear of wasting 3rd level spell slot or above.  

I also can't decide if riding bard to level 20 is the right call or multiclassing a single level into hexblade warlock, or fighter.  Either one gives access to a shield, medium, armor and all martial weapons which will beef up my bard and open the option for bow use.  Valor bard doesn't have enough in it for me to justify picking it over the other two archetypes mentioned above (unless someone else has a different experience?) so multi-classing is my only way to access the features I want.  

Hexblade warlock seems like a very overpowered level 1 dip, letting you make attacks with the charisma stat, access to the hex blade curse (absolutely amazing feature that comes back on short rest),  eldritch blast arguably the best cantrip in the game, gives you shield and wrathful smite spells, and a 1st level spell slot that recharges every short rest.  It has very good synergy with short rests which ties in very well with the bards inspiration and the use of the catnap spell.  I would almost consider a second level dip into this class just for the two eldritch invocations specifically agonizing blast and devils sight.  

The other choice is fighter for the fighting style (+1 ac or +2 to hit with bow) and second wind.  +2 to hit with the bow is like finding a +2 weapon to me and you can also find bracers of archery to really get a solid +2 and it energizes well with swift quiver allowing you to cast a spell with your action and attack twice as a bonus action effectively making you a better ranger then the ranger is.  

**TLDR**:  Which bard archetype College of Lore or College of Glamour and why.  Also would you take Bard straight to level 20 or dip one to two levels into figher or hexblade warlock. 

I welcome all replies and criticism of this build and thank you for taking the time out of your day to reply.  Thanks!   ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precautionary Warning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I know all of that temporary hp won&amp;#39;t be used and it will be overlapped for some characters, but reducing incoming damage by mitigation is far more effective then using a spell slot to try and heal the damage taken.  It also allows for any melee that are getting destroyed to back up from a situation and get healed or be able to re-engage a threat that got past them.  I think this has to be one of the most powerful uses for inspiration in the game it eliminates one of the biggest mechanics in D&amp;amp;D that stop people from moving during combat which is actually part of a feat called mobile and could come in clutch in so many situations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second feature is Unbreakable Majesty seems like an incredible way to burn an enemies legendary resistances and avoid the massive late game damage creatures can do for the price of a single bonus action.  They have to make a save before they can even hit you, much like the spell sanctuary, and if they do manage to hit you they have disadvantage on any saving throw they make against your spells on your next turn.  I can only think of one other feature off the top of my head that gives disadvantage against spells and it&amp;#39;s the shadow magic sorcerers Hound of Ill Omen which costs 3 sorcery points, a bonus action, and is very easy to kill with 37 hp and 14 ac as it doesn&amp;#39;t scale well at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know cutting words is amazing mitigation because it can cause a hit to miss, but Mantle of Inspiration is mitigation for the entire team not just one attack on one party member.  Additional magic secrets at level 6 for counterspell (I also take healing spirit because it&amp;#39;s really good) and then being able to use the level 14 feature peerless skill to add inspiration dice to the counterspell check is a ridiculous combo that makes it so you don&amp;#39;t have to up cast counterspell ever in fear of wasting 3rd level spell slot or above.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also can&amp;#39;t decide if riding bard to level 20 is the right call or multiclassing a single level into hexblade warlock, or fighter.  Either one gives access to a shield, medium, armor and all martial weapons which will beef up my bard and open the option for bow use.  Valor bard doesn&amp;#39;t have enough in it for me to justify picking it over the other two archetypes mentioned above (unless someone else has a different experience?) so multi-classing is my only way to access the features I want.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hexblade warlock seems like a very overpowered level 1 dip, letting you make attacks with the charisma stat, access to the hex blade curse (absolutely amazing feature that comes back on short rest),  eldritch blast arguably the best cantrip in the game, gives you shield and wrathful smite spells, and a 1st level spell slot that recharges every short rest.  It has very good synergy with short rests which ties in very well with the bards inspiration and the use of the catnap spell.  I would almost consider a second level dip into this class just for the two eldritch invocations specifically agonizing blast and devils sight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other choice is fighter for the fighting style (+1 ac or +2 to hit with bow) and second wind.  +2 to hit with the bow is like finding a +2 weapon to me and you can also find bracers of archery to really get a solid +2 and it energizes well with swift quiver allowing you to cast a spell with your action and attack twice as a bonus action effectively making you a better ranger then the ranger is.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;:  Which bard archetype College of Lore or College of Glamour and why.  Also would you take Bard straight to level 20 or dip one to two levels into figher or hexblade warlock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome all replies and criticism of this build and thank you for taking the time out of your day to reply.  Thanks!   &lt;/p&gt;

So I'm fairly new to D&amp;D, but I'm getting ready to get involved with my local AL, and am wanting to (at least loosely) plan out my character. Was hoping for some input/feedback!

I'm just looking to make a really fucking fun build. Here's my idea:

Race: Half-elf

Stat distribution: 8 15 15 8 10 14 -- planning on putting my half elf +1's into dex/con, so I'll have three 16's to boot.

Class plan: Bard 6+/Hexblade 3+ -- this is where I want some insight. I can't figure out how much of a dip I should do into Warlock, or when to do them. I was thinking of taking a one-level dip straight out of the gate, and then getting to Bard 6 for the extra attack before dipping back to Warlock for Pact of the Blade.

Level 1: Bard 1

Cantrips: Prestidigitation, Vicious Mockery

Spells: Dissonant Whispers, Silent Image, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Healing Word (not sure about this one?)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Level 2: Bard 1/Warlock 1

Patron: Hexblade!

Cantrips: Mage Hand, Eltridge Blast (I've heard arguments that a build like this might not need eltridge blast, but I don't know what other cantrip to take, pls halp)

Spells: Shield, Arms of Hadar

In 3/3.5 (as well as Pathfinder, IIRC?) you literally had to choose between a couple of free Archery feats, or a couple of free dual wielding feats. If you wanted to use a spear or an axe, you were just hamstringing yourself.

In 4e it was pretty much the same; two weapon ranger, archery ranger, or beast ranger.  (No thinking for yourself allowed!) 

5e got a *little* more freeing with ""Fighting Style"", giving you the option of archery, two weapon, defensive (+1 to AC while wearing armor), or dueling (1h only or 1h+shield). But there's no two hand option in that list, which is strange for 2 reasons:   
1) The ""Fighting Style"" feat is shared by Paladins and Fighters as well, and both of them get a ""Great Weapon"" (really  2 handed or versatile weapons of any flavor), but the Ranger simply doesn't have that option.   
2) This might be a personal hang-up, but I find a shield or thick armor to be much more egregious to the concept of a swift woodland scout than I do a two-handed weapon. (*Especially a spear!*) 

Now, I can understand in 5e where two-weapon fighting might appeal from a min/maxing stand point since it would allow you to dump your Strength score and focus on dex, but I still kinda want my ""Aragorn"" ranger with his longsword held in both hands.

The artificer has some nifty features that could make for an interesting melee combatant. To wit:

* At level 1, artificers have proficiency with simple weapons, medium armour, and shields, plus all crossbows. Nothing too fancy, but it's a darn sight better than being a wizard. Do whatever you can at this level with the gear you can afford.
* At level 2, you get infusions. One very interesting feature of infusions is that you can use any infused item as a spellcasting focus for artificer spells, and you *must* have a focus for all artificer spells you cast, therefore, you can cast spells while both hands are holding items, as long as at least one of them is an infused item. This opens up the weapon-and-shield option, which is normally tricky for spellcasters.
   * One of the infusions you can get at level 2 is Returning Weapon, which means that the weapon (which must have the thrown property) returns to your hand immediately after each attack, as well as being a +1 magic weapon. That's pretty cool for level 2! Put that on a javelin, and now you have a +1 weapon that does 1d6 damage (plus another 1d6 from Arcane Weapon if you cast that), adding your Strength bonus to attack and damage, which can be used to make melee attacks at 5' or ranged attacks at 30' (120' with disadvantage), and acts as a spellcasting focus. Use your second infusion slot on making your shield or armour +1, if you want.
* At level 3, you choose your specialty and hence your pet type. Both are good, but if you're going to spend most of your combats making attacks and casting spells, you probably want the homunculus, which you can summon in the morning and stays around all day, rather than the turret, which only lasts for 10 minutes and takes an action to summon (and another action for the second one at level 14).
   * The turret, while good in and of itself, doesn't really have any synergy with your combat tactics, either, while the homunculus opens up some interesting options. It can hang out next to you and use Help to give you advantage on one attack roll per round, at the cost of your bonus action. The salves it produces can give you temporary hit points for extra tankiness, or give you advantage on ability checks, such as the checks to perform or resist grapple and shove maneuvers. The temporary hit points last until expended, and the inspiration can last up to an hour, so either or both could be applied long before combat starts.
* At level 4, you can think about taking a feat, if you don't just want to buff your Strength or Intelligence.
   * If you take Polearm Master, you can switch from a javelin to a spear, reducing your throwing range to 20/80, but giving you an opportunity attack on anyone who gets in your face. (Oh, and if you thought that the bonus attack from Polearm Master when using a spear one-handed was silly, *technically* you get the bonus attack if you *throw* the spear at someone and it returns. It's a bad strategy, because if there's somebody within range of your melee attack, why are you making a ranged attack, but hey.)
   * If you take Shield Master, you can use an infusion to make your shield +1, so you get +3 to your Dexterity saves (against single target effects, sadly) instead of +2. The bonus action shove is a bit awkward if you wanted to use that bonus action to command your homunculus, but you can use its Inspiration ability to give you advantage on the Athletics check for the shove.
   * Fell Handed, maybe? Use a returning handaxe instead of a spear or javelin.
   * You could go for Great Weapon Master instead of using a shield, but for that, you'd need to multiclass, take the Weapon Master feat, or be a hobgoblin. A greatsword-wielding muscle artificer would also be pretty nifty, and you'd have the advantage of having a guaranteed +1 weapon early on, making you more likely to hit with GWM. No throwing weapon shenanigans here, though.
* Level 5 gets you two attacks, of course, so that's nice.

While you're building up your melee and throwing capabilities, you're using a shield and medium armour, while having medium spellcasting progression, including some healing and damaging spells and some nice utility spells, and you're not burning spell slots on smites like a paladin. It's not the best way to do melee combat, and it's probably not the best way to be an artificer, but I think it has potential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been pondering artificer builds lately, and while the obvious builds, as far as dealing damage goes, are spells and ranged weapons, I&amp;#39;m wondering what a Strength-based melee artificer would look like.

A greatsword-wielding muscle artificer would also be pretty nifty, and you&amp;#39;d have the advantage of having a guaranteed +1 weapon early on, making you more likely to hit with GWM. No throwing weapon shenanigans here, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 5 gets you two attacks, of course, so that&amp;#39;s nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;#39;re building up your melee and throwing capabilities, you&amp;#39;re using a shield and medium armour, while having medium spellcasting progression, including some healing and damaging spells and some nice utility spells, and you&amp;#39;re not burning spell slots on smites like a paladin. It&amp;#39;s not the best way to do melee combat, and it&amp;#39;s probably not the best way to be an artificer, but I think it has potential.&lt;/p&gt;

The Del Harun are from our Homebrew worlds, The Idea of Samsarras. We have a podcast set there of the same name. My Fiance plays Afsana in this game, who was the first Del Harun character. I have her the think for a lot of this. I'd love to know what you think, especially about the stats. 


Del Harun claim to have ancient dragon blood in their veins. While there are none who can prove or disprove this, it is obvious to those who travel with them for any amount of time that they are not mere humans. These desert nomads ride their horses across the burning sands of Qua’Lorn, resting each night to dream. They carry what they see at night into the day. 

Riders of the Sands, Riders of the Dahlen

To the Del Harun, dreaming life is just as important as waking life. They call the dream realm The Dahlen, and consider their experiences there every bit as real as their waking ones. Although every Del Harun takes their dreams very seriously, they know better than to blindly follow the lessons learned in the Dahlen.

According to the Wise People of the Del Harun, the demons of Samsarras live in the Dahlen. There, they propagate nightmares and false dreams, meant to harm and confuse. This is why the nomads can not believe just any dream they have. If a Del harun has a particularly troublesome dream and wishes to know the validity of it, they go to one of their shamans to have the vision interpreted as to its truth and meaning. 

Blood of the First Dragon

While most cultures see Luln as an evil demon, the Del Harun see things differently. According to them, Luln was the first dragon and he created the Dahlen, as well as the part of it that would be known as Samsarras. His loneliness led to him creating the rest of demon kind, though he would soon find that was a mistake. His progeny were evil and forever hounded the first dragon. Luln took human form and created a horse, endlessly fleeing before the demons. 

Creating the demons did not solve Luln’s loneliness, however. Slicing his torso with the curved blade of his Khopesh, he used his blood droplets to create the Del Harun. Together they rode across the sands of the world he created, battling the demons and finding companionship in each other.  The Del Harun loved Luln and wanted nothing more than to be closer to him. Ironically, this would lead to their separation. 

The Del Harun watched Luln shape reality and they desired the same. They wanted to be like their draconic father. Luln offered them a choice: they could continue to ride by his side for an eternity and live forever, or he would give them what they wanted.  If he allowed them to create as he did without restraint, they would be as powerful as their lord. They would be able to shape the Dahlen in their dreams. 

There would be a price, however. If they would wield those forces,  he would make them mortal so that one day they might die even as he lived on. The Del Harun accepted the offer, throwing away immortality so that they may be visitors and architects in the Dahlen. They believe this is why Elves do not die of old age as they do, for they do not truly slumber. They never accepted Luln’s deal. 

Home is in the Saddle

The Del Harun construct no villages and never stay in one place for too long. Their nomadic lifestyle often puts them in the role of merchants in eastern Qua’Lorn, trading goods from one city to the next for supplies and wealth. They must carry whatever they own, however, so they do not acquire material possessions just for the sake of ownership.

Horses are an important source of pride in their culture, and many can trace the lineage of their animals better than they can trace their own. It is an honor to own a horse from the bloodline of a mythic beast of times past. Such things are often used as rewards for service to the tribe. It is one of the highest honors to receive a foal from the Chief’s own horse. 

Their ability to ride their horses is known throughout Samsarras. There is no other group that may claim a greater proficiency. The best among them have performed incredible stunts for the nobles of Qua’Lorn, earning some amount of gold in the process. It is a rare individual who would call the horsemanship of the Del Harun into question. 

Del Harun Names and Conventions

The Del Harun claim to be descended from bronze dragons, and point to their golden brown skin and green eyes as proof of this. Their hair ranges from dark brown to blonde. The nomadic lifestyle of the Del harun often leads them to have weathered looks, as the desert sun, wind, and sand toughen the skin. 

The majority of Del Harun tribes are patriarchal, with the position of Chief being passed down to the eldest son along blood lines. Each tribe also has a War Chief who is expected to take over in times of physical strife. Traditionally, the Chief verbally hands over control to the War Chief, who then returns the tribe to the Chief after the tribe is safe. This is not always the way of things, however. 

Aside from the Chief and War Chief, each tribe also has a shaman who is well versed in the Dahlen. It is left to them to interpret the important dreams of the tribe, as well as administer healing and herbs to aid in sleeping and dreaming. Some few have even possessed magical abilities, though that is the exception and not the norm. The shaman will generally train their successor, taking on an apprentice when they recognize someone has the aptitude. While the shamans are mostly women, it is not a gendered position in any official capacity.     

The Raven’s Claw tribe has inverted the usual structure of Del Harun tribes, with women taking on all of the leadership roles. Because of this, women from other tribes of Del Harun have been known to leave their people to join the Raven’s Claw. The men of the tribe ride, fight, and live alongside the women. While recognized and celebrated for their contributions, they are never given positions of prominence.  

Most tribes see heterosexual monogamy as a default, though all orientations are accepted. The exception again is The Raven’s Claw, where homosexual polyamory is the norm, especially among those of the tribe that identify as women. None of these cultural norms are law, however.

TL/DR:  I see a lot of compelling reasons to take a Padlock to Warlock 2, but don't see much return in Warlock investment beyond that.

Currently slugging through CoS as a 6/1 Vengeance Pally/Hexblade.  I should hit my next level within the next couple sessions if XP progression remains relatively consistent, and I've been wanting to start mapping out character progression over the next 5 levels or so.  In doing so, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to justify taking anything more than 1 more level in Warlock.  I wanted to get some feedback on this, make sure I'm not missing something.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Case for Warlock 2**

Why go to 2 at all?  Why not just take the single level dip? Eldritch Blast Invocations.  And no, not even Agonizing Blast.  I mean Repelling Blast and Grasp of Hadar.  I'm relatively surprised I don't see this discussed more often, but the ability to move an enemy around the battlefield against their will, and with no save or recourse of any kind, I find to be extremely powerful and strangely underrated.  There have been so many occasions in this campaign alone where I would've killed to have the ability to throw someone back 20 feet, or drag them in 10.  Blasting enemies out of windows to thin the numbers, utilizing environmental features and effects for fun and profit, synergistic shenanigans with other party members (my druid pal's Wall of Fire comes to mind pretty readily).  I find the utility of forced movement to be hard to overstate.

&amp;#x200B;

Compounding this usefulness is the natural mobility of the Vengeance Paladin.  Presumably you have your Found Steed active at all times (I do).  That's 120' of movement, requiring precisely none of your own action economy, per turn.  You ought to be able to line up about any kind of shot you could need to with that kind of mobility.  Indoors?  Mount died?  You still have Misty Step.  Not nearly as far, true, and resource intensive, but if you can take that pesky caster out of the fight by blasting him off that precipice it's probably money well spent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also of note is the fact that all of this movement occurs *on your turn.*  So unless the target has some spell or ability they can activate as a reaction, they're going to go wherever you put them and there isn't a lick they can do about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the case of repelling blast, the movement utility of the invocation continues to scale with character level so you see a continual payout.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple all that with one more short-rest spell slot and one more Warlock spell, and I think there's a very solid case to be made for 2 levels in Warlock. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Case Against Anything More**

&amp;#x200B;

Quite simply it comes down to resources.  It goes without saying that Paladins depend heavily on their spell slots.  An investment beyond Warlock 2 simply doesn't provide enough of them to justify the level progression IMHO.  Consider, if you choose to go Pally 6/Warlock X, you will have a total of 8 spell slots *from character level 8 all the way to character level 17*.  And you will never see any more than 9, provided you character arc even takes you that far.  And yes, you have some short rest slots, *but it's only 2 of them* for the bulk of your playing career.

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, if you go Warlock 2/Pally X, you'll hit 9 spell slots at character level 9, 11 at CL 11, etc.  By the time your Warlock X hits 9 total spell slots, Pally X has 14.  So he has 5 more spell slots and 2 of them are still on short rest.  

&amp;#x200B;

And all of that is to say nothing about Pally 6/ Warlock 2/ Sorcerer 9 (the most logical choice in my mind).  That beast has 18 (!) spell slots, access to 6th level spells without being restricted to one, and all the fun of meta magic to go with it at the same CL the Warlock from above gets his 3rd spell slot.  

&amp;#x200B;

So what else are you getting for all that investment in Warlock levels?  Invocations, largely.  Invocations are cool.  They add a lot of utility and versatility to the Warlock class.  Barring the 2 discussed above, however, I'm not sure that they add a lot to the Padlock multi-class.  Consider that a lot of the more interesting ones for a melee-focused, in your face build don't really come online until Warlock 5 (CL 11 in this example).  Are any of them more valuable than the 3 more spell slots the Pally X has at this CL?  Or the access to meta-magic that a Sorc 3 could get here?  I'm not convinced that they are. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not to take anything away from the idea of Invocations.  Again, for a pure Warlock, they add a lot of versatility.  But as a Padlock, I don't need to speak with beasts, or disguise myself, or create illusions.  Those are other people's jobs, and they are going to be much better at those jobs that I would be.  My job is party face, primary or secondary tank, and boss killer.  There just isn't a whole lot in the Invocation tool kit, in my opinion, that makes me that much better at my job that it would entice me to give up the advantages other character progression paths provide.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL/DR:  I see a lot of compelling reasons to take a Padlock to Warlock 2, but don&amp;#39;t see much return in Warlock investment beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently slugging through CoS as a 6/1 Vengeance Pally/Hexblade.

My name is Ian, and I recently co-authored a series of booklets called *Archetype Magazine 2019* with my friend Ed. Each of the six booklets will contain two new archetypes, eventually covering all twelve of the base classes in 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons. We'll be posting a new issue every month  from January to June.

[Archetype Magazine 2019: Sourceseekers](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/271676/Archetype-Magazine-2019-Sourceseekers)

You can find the third issue, *Sourceseekers*, on [DriveThruRPG.com](https://drivethrurpg.com/) right now, introducing the **Way of the Third Eye** for monks and **Ancestral Magic** for wizards.

*Way of the Third Eye:* Meditating  deeply and mastering mind over matter, monks who train in the Way of the Third Eye gain extra-sensory perception, telekinetic prowess, and  incredibly resilient bodies. They eschew physical combat techniques, but they are rarely outmatched in the ring thanks to their enhanced mental state. 

*Ancestral Magic:* Wizards who study Ancestral Magic learn magic the old-fashioned way, favoring patient rituals over flash  and spark. Their spellbooks are filled with curious glyphs and long-forgotten seals, and they can eventually blur the barrier between arcane and divine magic.

We're really proud of the work and would be delighted if you checked it out and let us know what you thought! There's a full preview at the link above so you can read over the archetypes, and enjoy the awesome art our friend Frank ([@gaugex](https://www.instagram.com/gaugex/)) did.

We have brand new cover art for our previous issues, also by Frank. He really brought them to a new level!

For one encounter I wanted their to be a Beholder who asked questions or riddles or whatever. If they answer wrong they are thrown from the bridge...only to be teleported to the back of the line with the amount of questions or riddles they must answer increasing by one.

This leads me to believe that you can dupe Forbiddance into damaging a creature that isn't of that type, so long as you can somehow convince them to let you cast Magic Aura on them (which would be some other long, convoluted plan I'm sure).

Perhaps Warcaster would allow you to cast with both hands full, but the wording, as I recall, specifies weapons in both hands (which presumably the Wand and Rod aren't).

One player can't extend due to reasons. The others also don't wish to continue without said player, so I'm stuck with this time limit.

However, they only got through half of the encounter before I had to expedite it, as I saw we were running low on time.

Build Name: Tactician [name WIP]

Class: Eldritch Knight (12) / Necromancer (8)

Starting Class: Fighter

Race: Half-Elf variant (half Drow)

· Starts with Drow arts because it makes sense here.

· Pick a custom feature.

Background: Custom

Starting Stats:

· 13(+1) STR / 15(+1) INT / 10 DEX / 14 WIS / 12 CON / 8(+2) CHR

Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting

Selected Skills:

· History

· Nature

· Athletics

· Perception

· Insight

· Survival

Feats:

· Great Weapon Mastery

· Alert / Keen Mind / Martial Adept / Spell Sniper / Tough / War Caster (under hot debate; Martial Adept and War Caster are the most tempting)

· See above. If one of those is chosen, Tough is also most tempting.

Ability Score Increases: INT (+4), STR (+2)

=====

Big picture: Be the most versatile unit on and off the battlefield. The number of things one can do in this game is in the same ballpark as real life. This build wants to capitalize on the ""do almost anything (within reason)"" mechanic that's very much present in the game. In my last campaign, I don't think I got clever enough with everything I could do in a given situation, especially pre- and mid-combat strategy. Now I want to run a build that's all about that.

""Why necromancy?"" One of the easiest ways to die in this game appears to be getting outnumbered in units (and in damage, obviously).  The Necromancer portion of this build is meant to either turn the numbers in my favor, or see to it they don't shift out of favor (more numbers = more tactical advantage). Besides, the spell targets were already dead. They didn't need those bodies anymore, right? The Necromancer sub-class also patches the E. Knight's abysmal slot count, dumping 1,000,000 spells into my pool in the process that I can swap out when I level in Fighter. 

Personal fighting habits:

· Aim to be keeping a distance by default. The spell selection is how I'm going to do this.

· If something gets too close, it's getting smacked. Hard. Great Weapon Fighting helps raise the odds of getting good rolls.

· Charge in when advantageous. If something sees me approach, it should expect to die.

· In relation to the above, I have the most important buff spells I could want: Longstrider, Haste, Jump, Featherfall, and should I ever need it, Greater Invisibility. The first two or three on that list alone with Action Surge and Multi-Attack (x2) make rush down strats early- and mid-combat 200% nuts (***slices in TORANZAMU***). Use GI for more unseen approaches, and Featherfall in tandem with the other buffs for when you want to achieve your dream of being a cyborg ninja who runs along walls and jumps on targets.

· To be clear, the previous point contradicts the first point a little in that being the first to dash into a space of enemies can be a great strat.

The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.

4 Zones

Forest:
Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, creatures feel their brains begin to rot. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 INT save, take 4d6 necrotic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, they fall prone. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Caves
A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the caves. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 4d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, their movement speed is halved for the turn. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Rocks
This area has a rocky surface with massive boulders jutting up from the ground. When a 3 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, an image of the players worst fear appears hovering in the air above the zone. Creatures in the zone need to make a DC15 CHA saving throw, take 4d6 psychic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail they become frightened of the image. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Tower
The tower sits on a grassy surface, but the tower itself is 50 feet high and made of solid steel. The north and south sides of the tower have a hemp rope from top to bottom, and the east and west sides of the tower have metal chain ladders. A random level 6 spell scroll spawns at the top of the tower, and refreshes every three rounds. When a 4 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a lightning storm. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 4d6 lightning damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

~~~~~~~~

Fountains
In each forested area, there is a fountain of regeneration. It has a pool of 200 health it can restore to those who drink from it. You can only heal at the fountain on your original side. You can damage the fountain to drain the remaining pool of health it has left. Fountain is immune to psychic damage, and has resistance to all damage besides magical bludgeoning damage.

Flames
The entire back walls are magical fire. The team with the black egg has white fire, and the team with the white egg has black fire. This flame cannot be extinguished. Each player holds a magical bottle to capture some of this flame. When the flame is brought back to the egg of its respective color, it reduces the turns to hatch by 1. Players cannot hold more than one bottle at a time.

Death Slaad
The Death Slaad begins the game on top of the tower. It will begin the game pursuing the closest player it can see. The Death Slaad knows if someone is touching his tower, and will pursue them and ignore others for as long as they are touching it. It has 250 HP. The Death Slaad has a mind control gem implanted in its head and is being controlled by someone outside the arena who's spectating.

Other stuff
- Walls surround the arena with a ceiling 100 feet up.
- Players have x1.5 health.
- Each player has one legendary save die. Once during the game, players can use their reaction to roll a d12 and add it to a saving throw or your AC in response to failing a saving throw or taking a hit.
- If a player dies, they become a mummy.
- Your magical bottle to capture the flame can also hold 10 HP worth of healing water from your fountain. It cannot hold healing water and the flame at the same time.
- Hide and Readied actions are banned.

What wording am I talking about, specifically? In Chapter 3 the Wizard class gives the following guidelines for preparing spells.

1) They must be in your spellbook.

2) The spells must be a level for which you have spell slots.

That’s it. It seems to me, then, that a Wizard who had Fireball in his spellbook and had a 3rd-level slot to cast it with should always be able to prepare it.

The argument of general/specific might come up, so I will say this: The rule of “when in doubt, defer to the rules of the individual class” is a general rule. Furthermore, there is nothing in the Wizard class that forbids this interaction. So it seems to me to be a-go.

Hey guys, I tried this out with my group last night and they got a kick out of it and thought I should post it.

Basically as a DM, trying to speak for monsters, I could never come up with decent ""gibberish"" for the goblins, orcs, etc. to be saying. I wanted to make something that would fix my problem, and work quickly.

So here it is. Feel free to save as and make any changes you want. Simply input the phrase in common and what language you want and the 3rd cell will be the translation.

The second sheet has the simple excel code I used to accomplish this

Basically, I assigned each language a number and then to ""translate"" I had excel shift each letter back that number of letters in the alphabet (keeping vowels as vowels and consonants as consonants, I also changed Q's to Y's because they caused some issues)

I hope it helps someone! and all I ask is if you find something cool to add to it or something, post it on here so we can all use it!

&gt;When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked , or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

I do my best trying to figure out why a player would choose this useless misunderstanding patchwork... I am sorry but I still can't find a reason why!

Hell, domesticated animal should be a matter of herder or vehicle (mount) proficiency, should'nt it?

Dealing with wild animals should be related to Survival, which is a truly useful thing for an adventurer party.

If I hadn't brought you here and showed you the goblin camp they would have eaten her.  And look how many goblins there are!  They're going to attack the town, you know.  If you murder that kid, I'll totally take care of these goblins for you. And the kid was going to die anyway."" and after doing the deed when everything started swarming with goblins she tried to bust out her wings (Protector Aasimar) and I said, ""A dark energy flows over you as skeletal wings sprout from your back"" and she was very sad, pointing out that she had only killed the one child.  Sorry, guess one was your limit!

&amp;#x200B;

So now her and four of the others are on a malfunctioning planar craft turned laboratory turned evil monastery, floating hundreds of feet over a valley.  They charge into the prison area to liberate a few of the party that had been captured, she lets off a fireball that wipes out almost all the guards after confirming it wouldn't kill the prisoners, and the day is saved.  Then one of the NPCs they rescued says ""What about the ones out back?""  So she charges out back and finds all these prisoners on this platform over the void, some sort of loading dock thing, and it's all corroded and ready to collapse.  There are two fenced-in docks, and a conveyor is dropping crates onto the one because it's glitching out... because it's on fire.  Whoops, her fault.

&amp;#x200B;

So she runs to the other platform and the controls, which lock her in once they're activated.  She can switch which platform the stuff is being dropped onto but hers is, if anything, in worse shape.  I make it clear there are only two options because there's no time for anything else - leave the settings as they are and watch all the prisoners die, or switch it and she dies in their place.

&amp;#x200B;

So as I hit ""one"" on my countdown she switches it over and the big metal crate lands and smashes her platform, and she starts falling.  ""Anything to grab onto?""  ""Just stuff that's also falling.""  She looks at her character sheet, there are no spells that will help.  One of the other players asks if they can throw her a rope, but there's no way to throw it faster than she's falling.  She looks pretty distressed.  ""Damn it, if I had my wings... you know... I just saved a bunch of people... can I try?""

&amp;#x200B;

""A pair of radiant wings sprout from your back.""

She's SO excited.  She is thrilled that she's no longer a Fallen Aasimar, AND she gets her big hero moment of saving the prisoners and then flying up out of the void.

&amp;#x200B;

But of course, none of that was actually in the module we're doing.  And someone else could have been the first one to run out, or she might not have set off a fireball that could give me an excuse to have the device malfunctioning, or they could have thought of some other way to stop it, or she could have figured out what I was doing before making her choice (thereby making it meaningless), or a million other things.  But it worked out just like I planned.  Maybe next time she'll think twice about listening to evil soul-eating monsters wearing her friend's skin.  But honestly, probably not.

I have too many games going on and need someone to help me choose between

1 
rich storytelling with rewarding RP;
But dampened magic and items

Or

2 
amazing gameplay with over the top magic and a DM that wants to see those enemies explode;
But meh players and no weight to RP


So this Thursday I have two games coming up.
That's nothing unusual, but through scheduling issues of some members cabt make the usual time.

So now both games start at 5.


You can probably see where this is going...

The first game has a very invested DM with a colourful homebrew world that is fun to explore. The players are great at their RP and interacting with every character is fulfilling and fun.
The actual mechanical aspect is a little lacking, fights are sometimes drawn out and some spells and abilities feel nerved to add realism.

The second game is a ToA campaign where the DM gives out magic items and XP like candy to kindergarden kids. The characters are a little cliché and rough around the edges. The players seem like they are not always on the same team but work well when we actually sit down to develop strategies and co-op moves.
Spells and abilities work exactly as written which leads to one or two cheese-strategies which the DM happily allows in this high magic setting.
Next session we are going to hit lvl6 and then jump straight into a heist sequence. Needless to say, I'm excited.

But I still can't decide

I'm looking at my options for a Chaotic Evil character, with the theme being ""will rip apart and eat slain humans with its bare teeth"" and similar. Lizardfolk is the first that immediately comes to mind, but I'd like to explore my options and make an informed decision. 


My initial thoughts are: 


- [Simic Hybrid, Orc, Minotaur, Hobgoblin, Goliath, Goblin] have that ""is human-like, but I could still see them being cannibals"" vibe. 


- [Shifter, Naga, Lizardfolk, Kobold, Khenra, Dragonborn, Bugbear] have that ""further from human-like, and I can see them eating people alive"" vibe. 


- [Kenku, Aven, Aarakocra] are bird-people, so they have their own flesh-tearing vibe. 


So I guess I'll try to briefly break-down my impression of each: 


---


Whole of first category: They're a step-up from Human, but none of them seem ""bitey"" enough. 


Bugbear: A bigger, more intense version of the goblinoids/orcs. I think they'd be better at tearing raw flesh off of freshly-slain enemies with their teeth better than any human could. 


Kobold: A smaller Dragonborn/Lizardfolk. 


Aarakocra/Aven/Kenku: Bird-humanoids with big beaks. A solid option, but I'm not feeling the beak theme right now. 


Shifter: Animal-themed humans. Hard to say they're be more bitey than a Bugbear, flavor-wise, but mechanically they're definitely an option. 


Naga: Snake-where-the-legs-normally-are. Mechanically a very cool option, but flavor-wise I'm honestly not sure. Depends on how snake-like they are, I guess. 


Khenra: Dog-people. Solid option for theme.


Lizardfolk/Dragonborn: They're different, but there's some overlap in theme. Especially considering the lore behind the Lizardfolk, these two are very solid options.

A 3 - 4 session adventure that starts in Tier 2 isn't all that controversial and seems to be a bit of a hole in the market when it comes to published content. What I'm concerned about is the adventure starting mid-stream. 

The way I plan to execute it. The short premise surrounding your immediate situation is explained, where you are and what you've been through is briefly explained. And then the floor collapses (as an example) or, imagine Lost Mines of Phandelver but the first session opens with arrows flying through the air at the ambush scene.

The biggest downside I can think of is there isn't even a cursory chance to meet and establish a group, but if everyone at the table accepts the conceit that they're already a party, that can be handled. To further deal with this I've been considering a system where at certain points in the story a player or players get a ""Why are you here?"" or ""What have you been through on this adventure so far?"" moment where we pause for a moment, then the DM rolls on a specially authored table to feed the PC their improv hook.

I want to see if I can make him stand out; he doesn't need to be optimized, but at least not falling behind by a mile. Right now I have two concepts for such builds.

The backstory is that a half-orc comes across a githzerai and sees parallel between the duality of the gith people (because I love the story from Dakkon in PST) and that of his own heritage, inspiring him to take the monastic tradition.

1. I was planning to go for a pure Str Based Open-handed monk but the errata last year made it obsolete. Since a stunned creature automatically fails all shovel or grapple check then there is absolutely no reason to rely on strength any more. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this, I would love to bring the concept back. Else I might as well run a pure Dex/Wis open hand Half-Orc monk (10, 15, 16, 8, 15, 8) with more rounded stat. It's not a bad idea but I can see myself struggling for the first 4 level because I lack that +3 for Dex and Wis.
2. The next concept is to multiclass; if I want to utilize the Str bonus and to stay at front line, I could dip barbarian for HP, rage and resistance, but I have no idea what to do after dipping so I'd like some opinions on how to do it.

My current thought process is 16, 14, 14, 8, 14, 9... Barbarian for the first two levels, then roided monk all the way through. It'll either be way of the kensei or shadow since my DC and Ki pool will be lower than monk of the same level. Kensei synergies well with Savage Attack and agile parry can help with the AC, but I will suffer Ki shortage due to the barbarian dip. Shadow is... nice if I'm planning to take on a mage. I can cast silence, jump through the shadow and get close then hammer them, but that seems very situation-specific and doesn't offer me anything else. The obvious downfall is that when every other class get a huge boon at level 5 (extra attack etc) I'll obviously get left behind.

Context: I'm an older DM who is playing in a game with a bunch of people younger than I am by almost a decade. The DM of the group is a friend of mine who plays in a game I run and basically since my character is mostly there for fights he comes to me for advice on how to do certain things he wants to run in the game. He came up with the idea for a bar fight he wanted the characters to go through.

Fast forward a week or two and its game night. Instead of going to a bar, he's decided to do the whole thing in a flash back. I'm not crazy about flash backs because they tend to lack any sense of consequence since you're just going to fast forward back to the current time at the end. I decide to give it a chance and to my surprise the entire party is present (6 or so characters) except my pc.

My friend the DM then tells me he couldn't think of a way to get my PC in the flashback (Since he joined the group later) so he had a random NPC for me to play. At this point I wasn't interested at all in doing that. I don't like bar fights, I'm not a fan of flash backs, and I really had zero interest in playing a random NPC I had no attachment to.

I just flat out tell him to do his thing, not to dwell on it and to just get it over with. He tells me he doesn't want me to feel left out and I just blurted out ""Then why didn't you include my character? If you didn't want me left out you should have tried harder to find a reason for me to be here instead of handing me a random dwarf, hell you could have just said I was here getting a drink myself on a totally unrelated errand that would have been better than giving me a random NPC."" I'm pretty sure that upset him, and I just told him to drop it and carry on and that I'd wait for the bar fight to pass since we had a whole session ahead of us.

Well the bar fight goes on for two and a half hours, he's not letting guards get involved, he's not ending it any kind of quick even though some of the other players are trying to get it over with he's enjoying it, he's just dragging it out to the point that it's looking like the entire session will be a flash back bar fight and I just drop off discord without saying anything since they are all still playing I don't want to interrupt them and my character isn't there anyway. I messaged another player to tell him whats up so someone knows without me interrupting the game.

i was thinking about instead taking magic initiate(druid) and getting shillelagh. the way it's worded i only need ""the wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding"" which leads me to believe that wood carved from those weapons would work as well, thus club gauntlets + this spell would make me, partly, a muscle wizard. the ability to get into a fistfight makes me happy.

my concerns are that it doesn't scale (since melee weapons scale w/ multi attack) so something like primal savagery would cap out at 4d10(22) rather than shille's 1d8+5(9.5). i want something unique and fun, but not so underpowered.

I was thinking of making him an archer (though I&amp;#39;m not opposed to melee with a different build,) and taking Elven Accuracy and Sharpshooter down the line. The problem is, I&amp;#39;m not too interested in the rest of the Gloom Stalker&amp;#39;s kit and I&amp;#39;m trying to decide whether it would be better to take the rest of my levels in Champion fighter to expand my crit range or some flavour of rogue and focus on handing out a bunch of sneak attack damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, maybe there&amp;#39;s some other class I hadn&amp;#39;t considered - I&amp;#39;m open to other ideas if you&amp;#39;ve got &amp;#39;em. I&amp;#39;m new to 5E coming from Pathfinder, so there&amp;#39;s a bunch of stuff I haven&amp;#39;t had time to look through. I&amp;#39;m a little leery of playing a full-on spellcaster at this stage of my 5E career since I&amp;#39;m still learning the system.

I’ve seen plenty of answers, but one thing I’m curious about never gets brought up: how do people justify the levels of spell slots?

If I’m playing a high level wizard, and spell slots are being treated as some kind of energy I’m expending (for example, as this is one of the many answers I’ve seen as to what they are), then spending most of my spell slots would render me weak in terms of that magic energy. However, the last spell slot I have available could be a ninth level spell. This would make the following statement entirely true: “with all that remains of my power, I feebly cast... the strongest mortal spell in existence, wish.” That just seems screwy to me.

Of course, it’s possible to expend high level slots casting lower level spells, and I’ve seen people integrate this into their answers. They say something like, “a ninth level slot is the same magic energy as a lower level slot, it just represents spending more of it to cast a more powerful spell.” Which is frankly bullshit, pardon my language. Maybe you could describe spell points like that, but slots are distinctly different. If that were the case, I should be able to spend part of a ninth level slot for a first level effect, and then perhaps end up with an eighth level slot remaining. But that isn’t how it works. Using a ninth level spell slot on any spell requires spending the whole “thing” at once, whatever it is that “thing” is.

I’m not exactly looking for an official game answer here.

Before you stands a 15 foot high, 90 foot long corridor. The floor of the corridor is a bottomless **pool of lava**. Touching the lava causes instant death.

Well, then, okie dokie. As I was brainstorming the best format for framing the small excursion-style adventures that would comprise this escalating series of ""let's just kill stuff"" encounters, I still wanted to come up with a narrative that grounded the concept and helped make the threats of local monsters feel a bit more holistic than ""grr, arg, slay it."" Then it hit me--make the old monster slayer guild and nearby town like Sunnydale, California, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and slowly insinuate that there is some sort of ""hellmouth"" below the region which is constantly spitting out bad stuff or otherwise influencing the territory in warping, evil/chaotic ways. My thoughts then went to, say, an old cathedral or fortress buried underground following a \[reason\], which is now filled with alkiliths. Per MTF:

&gt;The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to that plane.

So, the hellmouth was easy enough to replicate in-game... basically, we've got some old ruin under the mountain whose windows and doors have been overtaken by fiends capable of opening steady portals to the Abyss. Cool. But so much about Buffy is not JUST the big bad plot, but also the wonderfully-flavorful monster-of-the-week episodes that churn up so many interesting baddies and the ways to resolve them. I've also been reading the wonderful Monster of the Week RPG out of the Apocalypse Engine, as the concept of cinematic hunters against the big bad world is captured very well there.

People of Reddit, my questions for you are:

* What favorite Buffy-verse encounters should I include? How should I do it?
* What would be great cross-overs in terms of using D&amp;D monsters and plots as analogues for Buffy monsters and plots?
* Without taking agency away from the players, how should I incorporate the librarian/sage/watcher Giles, or the other residents and core cast members from Sunnydale?

VAMPIRE
---

Vampires are not truly undead, though its quite easy to understand the misconception. Incredible lifespan, deathly pallor, unearthly features, sensitivity to sunlight, and a thirst for blood define the vampires of Szitensa. 

In their homelands, they operate with a hierarchical aristocracy, and cultivate a somewhat cult-like society within the populace of the ""lesser"" races of their lands. While the populace lives in fear of their wrath, it is considered a great honor to be chosen for your blood and welcomed into their luxurious court, and even greater still to be ""sired"". The vampires, for their part, adhere to a (somewhat twisted) code of actually maintain a fairly peaceful and secure rule, disliking outside disruptions to their ""cattle"", and rarely killing a good source of blood when they feed- at least not right away. 

Vampires divide into two major groups: Trueblood and Sired. Truebloods make up the aristocracy, and are born if union between two vampres; Sired vampires are former mortals (mainly humans, though others exist) turned by a vampire.

Lifespan: vampires live an extraordinarily long time, with the eldest among them being over 1000 years old.

Alignment: thanks to their rigid society and parasitic nature, vampires trend to lawful evil

Speed: 30 ft walking

Darkvision (the kind tieflings have)

Ability score increase: your charisma score increases by 2

Necrotic thirst: your fangs can serve as a melee weapon. They have the finesse property, and deal 1d4 necrotic damage. Additionally, a successful bite heals you equal to 1/2 your proficiency modifier. For each week you go without drinking blood, you suffer a point of exhaustion

Sunlight Sensitivity

Beguile: you can cast Charm Person once per day without expending a spell slot. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Languages: you speak common and 2 languages of your choice



TRUEBLOOD
---
ASI: your intelligence score increses by 1

Vampiric Flight: you have the ability to fly via a dark magic. You have a fly speed of 30ft as long as you are not wearing heavy armor and are not encumbered

Xxxxxx

Obviously it needs cleaning up and language brought in line with standards. I also need to figure out what Sired vampires do, to make them appealing against, yknow, flight. I know i want them to get their ASI bonus to strength. 

As for what i used as a guide for balancing this, i looked at Aaracockra. They get 50ft fly speed and a d4 natural weapon as well. I feel like the sunlight sensitivity (and the lesser fly speed) is enough of a downside that i could even add something else beyond the charm person, but iunno.

To summarize the Combat as War philosophy: There is no assumption that combat will be balanced. If PCs aren't careful, they can easily find themselves outmatched and killed. If they prepare appropriately, they can evade combat completely, or turn it into a turkey shoot.

1.Encumbrance (PHB p176)
a)If your carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.
b)If your carry weight is in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

2.Rest Variants (DMG p267) Slow Natural Healing (DMG p267)
a)GRITTY REALISM This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to engage in too many battles in a row. and all adventuring requires careful planning. This approach encourages the characters to spend time out of the dungeon.

3.Training to Gain Levels (modified from DMG p131)
a)Characters must spend a long rest meditating, training, or studying to focus their gained experience into tangible growth and development. Doing so costs 20 GP per level in materials and training.

4.Visibility/Noticing Other Creatures (DMG 243)
a)While exploring, characters might encounter other creatures. An important question in such a situation is who notices whom. Indoors, whether the sides can see one another usually depends on the configuration of rooms and passageways. Vision might also be limited by light sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, weather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely to hear one another before they see anything. If neither side is being stealthy, creatures automatically notice each other once they are within sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, compare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as explained in the Player's Handbook.

5.NPC/Monster Loyalty/Morale rules 
a)Monsters and npc's may flee when the situation looks dire for them.
b)https://www.neuronphaser.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-morale/

6.Random Encounter Tables
a)If an area is likely patrolled, the party is being hunted, or if there is a chance for an encounter random tables will be rolled upon.

7.Researching Monsters and Challenges
a)In a game like this Information is much more valuable, and I’d rather make information more available than less.
b)Being able to research a dungeon, monster, or area is something that will readily available to your characters. That could mean a Wizard scrying or using a library, or a ranger scouting the woods and conversing with animals or people to gain useful information, or a barbarian intimidating a criminal for info on the bandit hideout, mix and match and find out what your enemy is.

8.Henchmen

14.Strict Time Keeping
a)The DM will keep an accurate calendar and mark days as they pass.
b)The DM will do his best to mark the passing of the hours as well and keep track of the time of day. 

15.DM as a neutral judge of rules
a)This requires a bit of trust. I don’t want the adventurers to lose, I like it when you win in fact seeing players beat real challenges is fun for me. But the challenge comes from setting a real problem for the players to tackle and to do that I must remain an impartial rules arbiter.

16.Enemies will fight with strategy and tactics

Im looking for... i dont know, input? Thoughts? of what i could have made different because this session really didnt go as planed. 


To start of, my three players are all level 13, decked out in a fair amount of magic items and trinkets. At the start they were supposed to fight a bunch of cultists of demogorgon and a dragon fused with an ""eye of demogorgon"" a magical gem that had meshed two dragons into one (a blue and a brass), i used angry GMs [paragon](https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/) monsters for it, basically two adult brass dragons sharing one body with the only change that one could use a lightning breath to represent the blue side. 


But due to clever uses of silence, magic items and a few good deception rolls the cultists lair was taken apart easily and noone of the cultists had a chance to summon in any demons to help and they quickly fell to the players. After that they descended on the twoheaded dragon and quickly put that down too. After the fight was done the fighter had ~15 HP left and the monk and warlock was both above half, they then proceded to check out the rest of the lair for any magical trinkets and coins they missed. 


But when they went out of the lair the brass dragons mother, an ancient brass dragon, demanded the eye of demogorgon for safekeeping, shortly thereafter an ancient blue dragon showed up and did the same. 



Now here is where things went wrong i think, my assumption was that they would side with the blue since they had a ""you help me i help you"" relationship, they stole a book for her and in return she gave them safe passage through her domain or that they would just drop the eye and let the dragons fight over it while they ran away. But we all know that no plan survives contact with the players. 


A battle started, but the blue dragon that also is a high level spellcaster got the upper hand fast when she casted imprisonment on the brass dragon, she then took the gem and decided to teleport away. In that moment my players decided to run up and grab a hold of her. Through all of this she had basically ignored the players since her only goal was the eye. But once she was back in her lair with the players she gave them another option. Stand down, walk away and i will let you live, i just want the eye! 

My players decided to fight her some more. After a few turns with a breath attack, and some claw attacks and with the party still standing, she decided to end it. She cast meteor swarm, the warlock is down, the fighter falls down, the monk is still standing but is quickly killed of with a tail swipe. 

The part is dead, its a TPK, my first ever. 


At this point im frantically thinking of how to salvage the situation, this wasnt even supposed to be a battle, they had all the chances in the world to walk away. So i did something, i deus ex machinaed a solution. She dumps the bodies quite a bit outside her lair, they lay there for a day or two. And then one of the barbarian tribes that they saved previously finds them, resurrects them and thats where we ended the session. 

Was this a good way to handle it? They knew from the start that they were outmatched by any of the ancient dragons and that their best option would have been to run away. I talked it over with the warlock player on my way home and he agreed a bit. It was a very convenient thing to happen that the barbarians showed up, but he also voiced that he thought they should have fled the battle since they knew the blue dragon was powerful. 
We talked over it a bit and he said its nice to ""be alive"" and that he understood why the dragon killed them and also why i deus ex machinaed a resurrection since noone really wants to reroll a new character. But i dont know. It just feels a bit cheap somehow.

They were wary of the obelisk, and would have avoided it until they inspected it a little more closely.  They saw an additional bit of writing saying ""You might be lucky to win a prize!"" Bait set.

First time DM here running Sunless Citadel next week!  


I would like your advice on a problem I'm considering  


Sounds like it would be a good idea to not allow dragonborn as a race. Yet I don't want to limit the freedom of my players so much. How would you implement a dragonborn PC considering the presence of a dragon worshipping kobold tribe?  
I mean the RP potential is great, but how will Yusdrayl, the kobold leader, react to a dragonborn? Will they be simply frendlier or will they submit to their new overlord? The more I think about it the more I feel like the problem might be in my head alone. Surely Yusdrayl has seen dragonborn adventurers before and knows well that not all of them are to be trusted.  


She could interpret the presence of a dragonborn as a godly envoyee to rescue the dragon Calcryx and help the tribe to take finally over the whole citadel. As much as she could smartly doubt them and treat them not differently from other adventurers.  


How would you deal with this situation?

First time playing dnd (or any rpg with an emphasis on the rp) and could use some advice. 

Recently one of my friends (TG) got seven of us together for a campaign. We're all fairly new to dnd - TG has played in a campaign and has a set of the rulebooks, DM vaguely knows about the premise and is a first time DM, I have wargaming experience so I'm familiar with mechanics but less familiar with rp, and the rest are fresh newbies who were hooked more by rp than mechanics (they were introduced by naddpod, a comedy dnd podcast).

TG is super helpful with getting everything set up and helping everyone with stat sheets, as well as helping the DM get oriented. TG plays a CN rogue. First few sessions go really well - we're all friends so we're all having fun stumbling our way through rp and combat; TG does typical CN stuff like trying to hide gold he found from the party (he didn't manage to hide it; we all give him shit for it, hilarity ensues). 

Last session, we started after we killed our first named boss atop a tower (fairly easy, TG and I both have relatively min maxed characters and DM is still tuning challenge ratings for our group) and finished a long rest. TG resummons his owl familiar, which our bard immediately grabs and chucks off the tower, presumably as a joke. TG declares pvp and stabs the bard for more than half his hp in one hit. Luckily, we rp'd our way to deescalation and headed back to town. 

This is worrying to me - when I asked why he didn't just have his familiar take a dump on the bard's head, he said ""it's what my character would do - actually, I should have just kept attacking until the bard was incapacitated"". TG has a fairly min maxed character, a half elf rogue with an owl familiar from a feat (we all got free feats at lv 1 at his suggestion so he wouldn't be forced into variant human for his build), and he put his half elf ""+1 to two other abilities"" both into dex (despite what sage advice says, I know, but when I brought that up, he said ""Mike Mearls isn't the rules guy, I would only agree if Crawford said that""). Sure, when it comes down to it it can always be homebrew, but when it's being used to allow someone to overpower a newbie's pc then that seems problematic. 

Anyway, anyone got any advice on dealing with (preferably with rp methods) this sort of thing? I'd rather not have things going down the ""pissed off CN becomes loner"" path as at the end of the day, we all just want to hang out and have fun (also we actually like TG). On the other hand, I'd also not want a game where everyone is afraid of defying the CN in case they get 2-shot by a min maxed pc.

Please feel free to read whatever. I've marked a couple fun stories in the paragraphs below. Hopefully my formatting isn't 100% dreadful.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently decided to give my hand at D&amp;D

&amp;#x200B;

 \-Awhile back, I had a very very brief introduction after being invited to a party of some online friends; which quickly went sour immediately following the first session..unfortunate 

&amp;#x200B;

Skip forward to the present... I jump on the DM bandwagon, and got some coworkers in on the action! At first, I was appointed to try DM'ing a few dungeons, and maybe some small home-brew quests to get my 'sea' legs so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately for me, our first session day happened to be on the same day I got paid! Dropped over to my local hobby shop - looked around, and picked up some extra die, vinyl grid mat, and the D&amp;D 5e Starter Kit... last moment, decided to run the Lost Mine of Phandelver adventure. Everyone was pretty stoked to play, myself included to DM it! All has been going prettttyy well, having 2 sessions in one week, and will most likely be 2 this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

There were a couple times where reading, and making notes were a little tasking - usually only when my players were deep in discussion, and I could listen in, making notes about what they could decide, and what their choice could do to the adventure; rather, where I'd end up in the book. (I originally looked at it too linearly, and now just keep it on the side, flipping from part2 to part4...part3, back to part2 as story, or the Players call it - though always trying to nudge in the right direction if I think they might miss something they'd enjoy/benefit from)

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------&gt;As a bonus read - one of my favorite parts was a Short Rest I made them take...wasn't written in the story, but I felt it necessary to get their RP'ing ball rolling. 

4 of the 5 are completely new, one of my players having already played a few times, just for reference. 

One of my PCs wanted to go hunting...rolled really well for his hunt, got a clean kill, which I described to be what seems a very large Rodent (think wombat) - He then passed it over to our Rogue for a skinning (he being Half-Orc) .. she rolled a CLEAN 20 +4 (survival used for roll as a quick ""too drunk, roll for this to see how clean the skinning is)... skinned this creature like never before and got everyone a healthy 8oz cut, which she then rolled survival again for stewing the meat up instead, and rolled a nice 18 +4. 

After everyone had 'eaten' I gave the table an inspiration point for awesome role-play...INSANE rolls for a nice hunt/meal... and even added on top what I called a Status; ""Full"" which equaled 4 hours (in game travel/fight time etc) of +1 to STR rolls. 

\----------&gt;Continued funny story (I'll make it brief)

I threw in a little perception/stealth situation for them near their area of short rest 

\- they all unfortunately very badly bombed the Stealth rolls (checking some clearings in the woods), I then just threw in that one of our PC's, on her terrible roll of 2 (and mod) caused her to trip and hit her head on a small rock - 'roll your d4 for damage please' &lt; instant sadness with howling, and laughing from the rest of the table... 

Thankfully she only grazed the rock, taking a small goose-egg on the back of her head, dazed but no worse for ware. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: DM'ing is fucking great - hilarious - engaging (for me and my players &lt; naturally pretty creative and inspired) I'm looking forward to continuing our wild ever more confusing, and fun Campaign. (also helped me get away from my PC gaming habit...still there albeit very seldom..)

.....everyone is getting along wonderfully...though a few too many brews can bring some very deep, arduous discussion..fun none the less lol.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW - I'd like to ask....any tips/tricks/explanations on some maybe tricky mechanics I might eventually encounter? For instance, saving throws fucking wrecked my brain trying to understand exactly WHAT kind of spells/poison situations/etc etc.... Anything and everything you've got to offer is great, and much appreciated. For example, maybe something you learned on your own, or was told by an experienced player/dm that isn't really touched on or obvious, and the like.

I have a large number of players in my group, one of whom is my long-term SO. We're currently 10th level.

&amp;#x200B;

Last session, my SO achieved something they'd been trying to do for a long time: becoming a half-dragon.  I  described the ritual with some fanfare, but since I have a lot of players, I didn't give it a huge lead up. It happened, my SO was excited, I read out their new abilities. (Basically just a breath weapon as they were already a Draconic Sorcerer). I changed the half-dragon breath weapon from Recharge 5-6 to once per short rest and to compensate, slightly buffed the damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of my players *hated* this. Around the table I saw eye rolls, looks and many ""DM's Girlfriend"" looks going round the table. My problem is I think this is extremely unfair, as pretty much all of my players have had major buffs that are OP at different times. For example, one player had an epic boon at level 7, several others have an extra feat, one is playing a powerful homebrew paladin, another is playing with reading of a feat that allows him to have all spells prepared at all times. In the previous session, I'd given 20k XP to a player who had achieved a significant character goal after playing for more than a year trying to achieve it. In previous campaigns, I've made up new spells for my players who achieve character goals. My point is that my game is pretty unbalance, and I've always been OK giving new abilities, including homebrew ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Only when my SO gets a new ability do they complain. I feel this is sexist, but on the other hand, they complain that they feel she has become too powerful and has too much influence on the parties direction. I don't think this is true, as she's 4th highest in XP, picked bad feat choices, and has not taken an ASI for her CHA yet. Nontheless, I'd like your opinions about what to do.

Bolas has summoned all planeswalkers to Ravnica using a beacon made by the Izzet League and locked them there with a artifact know as the ""The Immortal Sun"". he has also destroyed the chamber of the guildpact replacing it with a Planar portal so his army of advanced undead know as Eternal or the Dreadhorde can invade the city. they are destroying the 10th distinct to find planeswalkers to kill and drain their Sparks the power sources of planeswalker to be collected by Nicol Bolas. we do not know if the the city will stand at the end of this storyline, but it should be a ride. citizens of Ravnica are very much caught up in the middle this conflict. here are some links to cards in the set to show the scale of things

I ran a session today where, at the end of the session, I felt kind of like I'd simply run the PCs through a series of events that moved the plot forward, but didn't give them real options aside from what they did within the several encounters.  

Here's what happened:

1. They started fighting a Morkoth from their ship. Due to heavy story reasons, their actions caused a rift in the Material Plane about 40 feet above the ocean's surface and the Plane of Water started spilling out into the ocean, complete with Sea Serpents. A trusted NPC said ""Let's get out of here!"" and they did... 
2. They arrived at a familiar city, and were being led through the city streets by a guard to see the City Council (expected) when a strange monster was seen attacking a woman in an alleyway. They fought it and defeated it. Again, this was an important story point (that these kinds of monsters have made it into the city). But it felt a little hand-holding.
3. They went to see the City Council and were scolded (as expected), then sent away. 
4. They then ran into an important NPC who was shot by an assassin when he was talking to them. They located and took down the assassin, and learned more information from both the assassin and his NPC target.

  
So my concern is that they didn't have a lot of agency during the session. Once we rolled Initiative for each encounter, they could choose how to use their combat and other skills to fight the Morkoth or the Lost or the Assassin, but the rest felt like I was simply shepherding them through the events in order to have those encounters. In other words, I felt like stuff kept happening TO them rather than by them.  
Does anyone else have this problem? Or this concern? Or advice for how to avoid this? 

I'm afraid I have sort of trained my players in this type of play and want to change it up. Let them be more in control of what happens. Or is this just how the game is played sometimes?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worry sometimes about railroading...   &lt;/p&gt;

First of all, the rest of the team is comprised of a cleric, wizard, ranger, and warlock. Essentially everybody but myself is either a caster or at least a half-hour, which is why we felt that I should opt for a martial clase despite initially being hesitant as I very much dislike martial classes and especially martial melee classes.

One of the reasons I was hesitant to play martial was becuse I always liked the idea of each character having a particular skillset they could lean into and have time to shine with, but given the setup of the team and the choice of races and classes, pretty much every skill was covered. Hopeful I'd find my own in combat and be able to lean into that and RP, I built the character and got into it.

After 5 sessions, I'm finding myself more and more disappointed each time I play. Because of a series of comparatively poor stat rolls, the rest of the group is sporting 18 in their main stats while I'm still sitting at 16's, with some others not even being too far behind my scores in my main stats  So in combat, I find myself struggling to find a use  The cleric is both a better frontliner than me with their plate, and a better pair against undead which I feel as supposed to be my specialty. The Ranger and Warlock hit just as hard as me with Hunter's Mark/Hex, far more reliably, and with range to boot. Of the entire group, my character is the only one that's gone unconcious, and numerous times to boot.

It's gotten so bad that the DM has been not so discreetly dropping Homebrew items tailor-made for my character: a weapon of speed so I can use my bonus action for something .ore often, and chain that gives melee attacks a 30ft range to let me stay out of the Frontline, bloodhunter armor that let's me cast haste on myself. I know she means well, but every time we get out of a fight with everybody looking fine and my character stumbling out only to receive a consolation prize, i just feel like my pride and the entire concept of this grizzly seen-everything warrior takes a punch to the gut 

Normally I'd try to lean on RP here, but as luck would have it everything I was hoping to evoke with my backstory has also been overshadowed. The ranger is a far older, far more veteran warrior. The celestial warlock has a far deeper connection to the gods. The teifling wizard has a far more fleshed out connection with the dark forces of the eorld.

Combine this with the fact that my characters skills are always overshadowed because there's always somebody better at all of his skills in the party, and the fact that all of his story is just a lesser version of other players stories, I get less and less invested in the RP as time goes on. It got to a point last session where I lost all track of pacing and blurted out my entire characters backstory before it's had a chance to come up, effectively killing the last remaining shreds of interest I had in continuing to RP that character.

I keep thinking of bringing this up with the DM, b cause I'm just not having fun even though I really am trying, but it's gotten to the point where my character has just devolved into something I'm not proud of, don't like, and don't enjoy playing: a joke. Ii want to stress that the DM and the players are all great people and great friends of mine, and none of this was their intention but moreso poor planning on my part. This is why I'm so hesitant to bring it up - I don't want to cause problems for the DM and the other players by inconveniencing them, I just want to be able to enjoy playing with them and I currently don't.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m currently playing a lvl 6 Aasimar ghostslayer bloodhunter in a group of 5, and despite only playing a few sessions I&amp;#39;m rapidly losing interest in the character and having very little fun.&lt;/p&gt;

It got me thinking, why do I feel so emotionally upset at the prospect of rolling stats (especially in order)?

I realized because that’s what life did to me and I play DnD to experience a simulation of a life more exciting and just downright better than real life. 

Life rolled 3d6 in order for me and everyone else. Im blessed it gave me an 11 or 12 or something in Intelligence. But the 5 or whatever it gave me in Constitution and all my chronic illnesses? Fuck that. Especially when, I selfishly and enviously, see people who rolled 18s or what have you in their stats. 

Life is unfair. I hope that I can make efforts to make it more fair for the people around me, but I know life is capricious and random. DnD is random. It literally involves rolling dice. But when it comes to who I am in this fantasy world, that randomness hurts. Just for this fleeting moment, it’s beautiful that my hero and my friends’ heroes all have the same array/point buy. We are all different. I am a nimble charming rogue whilst my friend is a powerful and wise healer. But in our differences we are equal. 

DnD is a fantasy. I want it to involve challenge and even heartbreak. But to roll 3d6 in order? Fuck that. I live in a world that does that and I hate it. 

EDIT:

to be clear:

I understand the value of 3d6 in order and that for some games/tables it is a good idea. 

It’s just that I have such a visceral reaction to it and I had an epiphany of sorts of why.

As our characters level, how do we thematically explain how our characters obtain these new fancy skills and abilities?

In regards to divine casters I think its a bit easier, for example:

You awake the next morning after a dream of your god (or what may have you) coming to you and blah blah you realize you have access to this new spell with the ability to know the somatic and verbal parts needed to cast it.

In regards to my future Kensei monk however, how would I explain that after X amount of weeks traveling with this group of people, he wakes up the next day and realizes he can speak and understand all spoken languages (Tongue of sun and moon)? Or the fighter realizing he can shoot an arrow that literally banishes the creature to another plan of existence (Banishing Arrow)?

This is my first post here but I thought I'd ask the internet for advice. I plan to run a home brew 8-10 session adventure starting level 6. This is when 9 classes have subclass features for extra flavour and because we've never managed to get beyond level 5 before GM fatigue sets in.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting equipment is an issue, especially as magic items which influence build decisions. There is also the whole artificial ""you found the perfect item to fit your character"" issue that happens which can be bypassed to some extent by starting with it (if it's uncommon).  The DMG seems rather stingy and whilst I don't want magic items to be commonplace, it's nice to provide mini power-up rewards mid-level (which will be milestone-based, none of this ""we better solve this by fighting for the XP"").

&amp;#x200B;

Below is what I came up with and I would really like the experts to pick holes in it, find broken builds etc. I have avoided uncommon items that I think should be rare like Winged Boots, Broom of Flying and Helm of Telepathy, as well as more situational items unless there is synergy/thematic resonance with the class (e.g. Monk and Water Walk). I have also used the common items in XGE to simplify purchasing high ticket items (200gp+) so that spending budgets are less onerous.

&amp;#x200B;

My main worry is some of the items are simply my evaluations - very few people will have encountered all these items in 5E versions. So there may be items that are just too powerful that have found themselves onto the list. Most classes get 1 really good item to attract that kind of player. Want to be a Blaster? Go Sorcerer with Wand of War Mage +1. Want to be a Controller? Go Wizard with Wand of Webs! That's why I simplified some of the choices to ensure players don't turn down the obvious item in that class list. I also wanted Weapon of Warning to be rare, for 2 weapon fighting or Bladesingers (and you can always use a Moon-Touched Shortsword in the off-hand as a magical weapon attack).



**LEVEL 6 CHARACTER CREATION**

&amp;#x200B;

Ability scores generated using 27 points buy; non-random hit points; yes to feats and variant humans; no to multi-class. **No duplicate classes, races or backgrounds; no duplicate non-consumable magic items**; players coordinate builds!

&amp;#x200B;

Each player has 3 special items from a menu based on their class. Options such as “Weapon +1” grant a choice to comply with the No Duplicates restriction. But note only 1 spell-caster in the party can have a Pearl of Power etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Each spell-caster has a spell components pouch with all costed components for all accessible spells (but only 1 casting if consumed). In addition, each player has a budget of 100gp to buy PHB equipment and any additional spell components which are consumed. Players also start with background items but leave their background gold unspent. 1 player (lowest listed class from the alphabetical classes below) also has a Bag of Holding (for the party).

Enduring Spellbook: 12x level 1 + 6x level 2 + 6x level 3 (+ 6x specialist school spells if PHB tradition)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I will explain to players they need to ensure they have a magic weapon or damage cantrip to bypass numerous monsters with non-magic weapon resistance (there are also lycanthropes and golems with their immunity). And this helps explain why the general populace need their help. It helps that Monks &amp; Moon Druids also gain magical natural attacks at level 6.

&amp;#x200B;

Having no multi-class helps (a ranger, the weakest level 6 feature, will be given the ideal favoured enemies and terrain for this one-shot adventure). I dislike abusing front-loaded features via multi-classing (envoy war-forged war wizard 5 forge cleric 1, yuanti vengeance paladin 5 hexblade warlock 1, all exercises in ""how optimised can I build""?). And I've taken into account Hexblade or Valour Bard + Heavy Armour feat etc. But not every eclectic build is catered for. The idea was more to focus on a really strong theme for each class and ideally a few of players will take the fluff common items for RP fun.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my questions:

* Are there any items above that can be abused?
* Are there any items above that are trap choices? Replace with what?
* Have I missed out items (max. uncommon) that open up level 6 builds?

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Enduring Spellbook: 12x level 1 + 6x level 2 + 6x level 3 (+ 6x specialist school spells if PHB tradition)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will explain to players they need to ensure they have a magic weapon or damage cantrip to bypass numerous monsters with non-magic weapon resistance (there are also lycanthropes and golems with their immunity). And this helps explain why the general populace need their help. It helps that Monks &amp;amp; Moon Druids also gain magical natural attacks at level 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having no multi-class helps (a ranger, the weakest level 6 feature, will be given the ideal favoured enemies and terrain for this one-shot adventure). I dislike abusing front-loaded features via multi-classing (envoy war-forged war wizard 5 forge cleric 1, yuanti vengeance paladin 5 hexblade warlock 1, all exercises in &amp;quot;how optimised can I build&amp;quot;?). And I&amp;#39;ve taken into account Hexblade or Valour Bard + Heavy Armour feat etc. But not every eclectic build is catered for. The idea was more to focus on a really strong theme for each class and ideally a few of players will take the fluff common items for RP fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are my questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any items above that can be abused?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any items above that are trap choices? Replace with what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I missed out items (max. uncommon) that open up level 6 builds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers for getting this far and please be frank if you think this entire approach is flawed - I&amp;#39;d rather capture such issues here rather than later IRL!&lt;/p&gt;

My group had been playing Storm King's Thunder for almost a year and a half now, and after some crazy shenanigans we fought the last battle today against Iymrith, her two kids, and a bunch of purple wormlings today.  

Before the final battle, we got the Wyrm Claw and a potion of Giant Size.  Our leader, the Druid, got the Claw and my Sun Soul Monk, who does the most damage in melee, got the Potion of Giant Size.  So my DM really hates the Sun Soul Monk class.  He loves Monks, but the Sun Soul makes him angry because it can be a ranged monk, keeping the monk out of front line combat.

He played the Way of the Fist Monk in another campaign and he loved that character in combat.   He said it was high risk but high reward.

So, I'm pretty sure he did things to persuade me to go up and punch shit instead of spaming Hadoukens from 30 feet away.  Things like my character finding the Ilde Rune and him ruling I could add that extra D6 of fire damage to my punches (but specifically not the Hadoukens) and the Charm of the Slayer to my punches as well. I'm pretty sure that was because that feature annoyed of the class annoyed him so much.

Because of this, with Flurry of Blows, my damage was averaging about 45 per turn, out damaging the casters, fighter, rogue, and ranger at level 12 because it was consistent damage (20 points automatically if I make all four punches didn't hurt and my rolls are generally pretty decent). 

Now back to the Potion of Giant Size.  Normally it increases Strength, but he changed it due to my character being a petite wood elf, upping her Dex to 25 instead as well as tripling the amount of dice for each strike.

We got an army together and Harshnag (my monk's buddy - she was one of two people in the party who could speak giant, she actually knew what Force Gray was due to a good roll, was the one to first approach him to talk to him, and probably had the most interactions with him) to fight the dragons.

It was suggested that I didn't just gulp the potion right away (which in hind sight I should have, it would have made the entire battle easier).  So we killed the two adult blue dragons.  It was a fairly easy fight considering we were fighting two dragons (and I happened to double crit on a round of Flurry of Blows, which didn't hurt either).

Then of course Iymrith is pissed because we killed her kids, bursts out of the ground, and wrecks the party, knocking us back.  Poor Harshnag falls underground with the wormlings and we can't get within 20 feet of her because the ground around her is pretty much gone from her bursting out of it.  My now Giant Sized Wood Elf Monk has to throw some hadoukens, which was kind of hilarious when you think about it because they still did the normal amount of damage.

However, our druid leader had a great plan and managed to give us ground underneath the dragon again, bringing Harshnag into the fray once again as well.  Iymrith is still wrecking shit.  She kills our sorcerer to the point where he's failed two death saving throws.

Finally it's my turn again and Harshnag, our Fighter/Bard, an NPC Ranger (who is the GREATEST, but that's a story for another time), and I have flanked her, and our table has ruled that gives us Advantage if we're flanking an enemy (also gives enemies the same advantage as well).  I do Flurry of Blows with advantage on each of the four strikes.

Every one of them hits.

After I roll a lot of fucking dice I end up doing 141 points of damage, which was enough to finish the dragon.

But holy fucking shit, 141 points of damage as a giant elf literally beating a dragon to death with her fists.

I don't know if I'm ever going to top that in combat again.  I might have to retire as a melee player and switch to casters for a while, because holy shit I had a Kaiju Battle with a Dragon And Kicked Her Fucking Ass.

And, even more hilarious, my elf is super young.  She is literally just 18 years old.  Everything else is just going to be downhill from that. 

She is totally making a cape out of Iymrith's scales though to wear.

I do Flurry of Blows with advantage on each of the four strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every one of them hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I roll a lot of fucking dice I end up doing 141 points of damage, which was enough to finish the dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But holy fucking shit, 141 points of damage as a giant elf literally beating a dragon to death with her fists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ever going to top that in combat again.  I might have to retire as a melee player and switch to casters for a while, because holy shit I had a Kaiju Battle with a Dragon And Kicked Her Fucking Ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, even more hilarious, my elf is super young.  She is literally just 18 years old.  Everything else is just going to be downhill from that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is totally making a cape out of Iymrith&amp;#39;s scales though to wear.   &lt;/p&gt;

I'm still not sure what everyone else will play but I've been working on the backstory and play style for what I want to try building: an Eldritch Knight.

I basically so far made him a Variant Human with Magic Initiate (for Guidance cantrip and Shield of Faith spell). With sword, shield and heavy armor, I have base AC of 18. Originally I had planned on picking the Protection fighting style, but I realized that with the build I was going for once I hit levels 3 and 4 I would have too many spells fighting over that one reaction.

Once I reach level 3 I'm picking up Shield, Absorb Elements and possibly Blade Ward. The entire playstyle I wanted to have was of a defensive/utility oriented character. But with so many abilities fighting over that reaction, I thought maybe I should switch to the Defense fighting style instead for that +1AC. If I do so, my concern becomes another one: What if the DM starts to make monster just ignore me since my AC is so obscenely high? (If I'm casting Blade Ward on myself or using cantrips during my actions, I will likely have my sword sheathed so the somatic components of spells isn't an issue even pre-War Caster). Then sure, I would have 19 base AC which could go up to 21 with Magic Initiate's Shield of Faith and then 26 with Shield of Faith + Shield. But if the enemies all decide to ignore me because I am nigh-unhittable, I don't have much I can do to help the party.

I&amp;#39;m still not sure what everyone else will play but I&amp;#39;ve been working on the backstory and play style for what I want to try building: an Eldritch Knight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically so far made him a Variant Human with Magic Initiate (for Guidance cantrip and Shield of Faith spell). With sword, shield and heavy armor, I have base AC of 18. Originally I had planned on picking the Protection fighting style, but I realized that with the build I was going for once I hit levels 3 and 4 I would have too many spells fighting over that one reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I reach level 3 I&amp;#39;m picking up Shield, Absorb Elements and possibly Blade Ward. The entire playstyle I wanted to have was of a defensive/utility oriented character. But with so many abilities fighting over that reaction, I thought maybe I should switch to the Defense fighting style instead for that +1AC. If I do so, my concern becomes another one: What if the DM starts to make monster just ignore me since my AC is so obscenely high? (If I&amp;#39;m casting Blade Ward on myself or using cantrips during my actions, I will likely have my sword sheathed so the somatic components of spells isn&amp;#39;t an issue even pre-War Caster). Then sure, I would have 19 base AC which could go up to 21 with Magic Initiate&amp;#39;s Shield of Faith and then 26 with Shield of Faith + Shield. But if the enemies all decide to ignore me because I am nigh-unhittable, I don&amp;#39;t have much I can do to help the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, considering the playstyle I&amp;#39;m trying to go for, which fighting style would you guys recommend and why?&lt;/p&gt;

Any other suggestions are still welcome!

Game
Your goal is to kill the enemy team. Each team has a dragon egg that hatches into a young dragon (young black dragon, but they’re black/white). One egg is black, one egg is white. The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.

4 Zones

Forest:
Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, creatures feel their brains begin to rot. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 INT save, take 4d6 necrotic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, they fall prone. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Caves
A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the caves. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 4d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, their movement speed is halved for the turn. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Rocks
This area has a rocky surface with massive boulders jutting up from the ground. When a 3 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, an image of the players worst fear appears hovering in the air above the zone. Creatures in the zone need to make a DC15 CHA saving throw, take 4d6 psychic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail they become frightened of the image. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Tower
The tower sits on a grassy surface, but the tower itself is 50 feet high and made of solid steel. The north and south sides of the tower have a hemp rope from top to bottom, and the east and west sides of the tower have metal chain ladders. A random level 6 spell scroll spawns at the top of the tower, and refreshes every three rounds. When a 4 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a lightning storm. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 4d6 lightning damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

~~~~~~~~

Fountains
In each forested area, there is a fountain of regeneration. It has a pool of 200 health it can restore to those who drink from it. You can only heal at the fountain on your original side. You can damage the fountain to drain the remaining pool of health it has left. Fountain is immune to psychic damage, and has resistance to all damage besides magical bludgeoning damage.

Flames
The entire back walls are magical fire. The team with the black egg has white fire, and the team with the white egg has black fire. This flame cannot be extinguished. Each player holds a magical bottle to capture some of this flame. When the flame is brought back to the egg of its respective color, it reduces the turns to hatch by 1. Players cannot hold more than one bottle at a time.

Death Slaad
The Death Slaad begins the game on top of the tower. It will begin the game pursuing the closest player it can see. The Death Slaad knows if someone is touching his tower, and will pursue them and ignore others for as long as they are touching it. It has 250 HP. The Death Slaad has a mind control gem implanted in its head and is being controlled by someone outside the arena who's spectating.

Other stuff
- Walls surround the arena with a ceiling 100 feet up.
- Players have x1.5 health.
- Each player has one legendary save die. Once during the game, players can use their reaction to roll a d12 and add it to a saving throw or your AC in response to failing a saving throw or taking a hit.
- If a player dies, they become a mummy.
- Your magical bottle to capture the flame can also hold 10 HP worth of healing water from your fountain. It cannot hold healing water and the flame at the same time.
- Hide and Readied actions are banned.


[https://imgur.com/dNHAzD4](https://imgur.com/dNHAzD4) \- one half of the map","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I took many of your suggestions into account and I think this is the game/rules were going with. Any other suggestions are still welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game
Your goal is to kill the enemy team. Each team has a dragon egg that hatches into a young dragon (young black dragon, but they’re black/white). One egg is black, one egg is white. The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Zones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest:
Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, creatures feel their brains begin to rot. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 INT save, take 4d6 necrotic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, they fall prone. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caves
A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the caves. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 4d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, their movement speed is halved for the turn.

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, devils are often portrayed as devious and cunning.  And what is more cunning than turning an enemy into a tool that is used for your own purpose?  Ones who&amp;#39;s existence will be short, violent, and likely painful while furthering your own cause.  It would seem like a win-win, and so would be right up a devil&amp;#39;s alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any opinions on this relation?  Any specific lore to back up one position or the other?  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

(Leaning towards taking 14th level Rogue for the Blind sense, but I don't know if it would be good spell slot-wise, and if it's needed since I may take 'Alert' as a feat instead of an Ability Score increase)

**1st question:** Can I have 2 archetypes at once? (College of Whispers and Arcane Trickster)

**2nd question:** How would I do spell slots? I have no idea what the grounded rules are, and if possible, I would love a solid explanation and/or source material for spell slots with a multiclass.

**3rd question:** Should I start as a Bard, reach 6th or 7th level, then switch to Arcane Trickster for the remaining 13 or 14 levels? Should I do the reverse?

**4th question:** Are my priorities stat-wise correct? What about which Features and Ability Score increase I should take? Which chosen Proficiencies and Expertise? (Definitely taking Stealth Expertise)

Extra Information: I have access to most books, but can easily find PDF's for the obscure ones.

I am playing a Lightfoot Halfling (+2 Dex +1 Cha after rolls)

Since we can sacrifice ability score increases for Features, I'm thinking about taking 'Lucky' and 'Alert'.

They regularly appear low on everyone's tier list, and they are empirically the least played class. But they are fantastic. There are 3 reasons for this.

1. Wild shape is incredible. As a Moon druid it makes you the best tank and disabler in the game, edging out barbarian depending on opinion, and definitely at level 20. For any other circle it gives you an insane amount of flexibility anyway. You are now the best scout in the party, you now have every movement option (burrow, climb, fly, swim), you now have possibly the best disguise in the game outside a shapeshifter, you have an escape skill, you can break into places by turning into a spider without even needing to pick locks, and you can do it all twice on a short rest. Your very existence invalidates the party role of half the other classes. It is also the reason that Druids are probably the best one man party.
2. You are a full caster with a solid spell list for support.
3. Depending on DM ruling/on how kind your DM is in letting you influence, they have access to probably the two best spells in the entire game: Conjure animals (for 8 stags) and Conjure Woodland beings (for 8 pixies). This is a bit questionable, but even if your DM gives you other animals this can still be incredible, particularly as a circle of the Shepard giving them magic attacks and tripling their health with bear spirit.  


The only thing that they aren't good at is blasting. Their damage is fine (almost on par with fighters at low levels minus action surge) but not phenomenal (unless your DM is kind with animal selection for summon animals). But almost every other class does that to some degree. Further, I would encourage you to consider damage not in terms of damage/turn but rather in terms of damage before you die. Druids win the second hands down, even if their nova isn't so good.

In terms of subclasses, Moon and Sheperd are incredible. Moon makes you a godly tank. Shepherd makes everyone a godly tank, including the 8 minions you summoned at level 5 (looking at you bear spirit).

I've googled around a bit and saw a couple other people have subbed in a drider and messed with other things as well to make the Nezznar fight less underwhelming. I've decided to make this a two-stage fight with Nezznar transforming into a magic-enabled Drider after he and his spiders (making this a phase spider and giant spider instead of 4x Giant Spider) are killed.

The party consists of 5 players who will likely be level 5 by this fight. If they're level 4 I'll tone down the fight a bit

### Phase 1:

Nezznar (CR 2)

Phase spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/phase-spider) (CR 3)

Giant spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider) (CR 1)

Quasit Familiar (still debating whether or not to have this, might be a bit tricky) [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit) (CR 1)

If I do include the quasit I'd have it disguised as a tarantula tracking the party throughout the dungeon with a couple opportunities to spot it and eliminate it for this fight. Additionally, it will void the contract with Nezznar as soon as he goes down (doesn't matter if the spiders are still up).

### Phase 2:

Magic-enabled Drider [stat block](https://i.imgur.com/QE2ZT39.png)

Any spell slots spent in previous stage remain spent. Kept his ""mental"" stats the same as the previous stage.  I've been debating nerfing the HP, or possibly keeping him at lvl 4 spellcasting instead of upping it to 5 (a little worried about vampiric touch, but counterspell would be fun). I'll probably give the party a very brief respite between the two phases (not a short rest but the cleric *could* cast cure wounds once or twice).

My players have also been both a bit loose with their resources and quick to flee and rest so I imagine they'll find a way to get to this fight with either much more or much less resources than expected of the fight.

### DMG CR Estimate for drider vs modified drider

Drider:  
Defense CR: 10 (19 AC: 17, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (28.5/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13: 0)  
Overall CR: 6  

Magic-enabled Drider:  
Defense CR: 7 (17 AC: 10, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (21-32/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13 &amp; concentration: 0)  
Overall CR: 5 (maybe a bit lower because of the lack of spellslots from the first wave and dependence on keeping vampiric touch concentration up for the higher damage output)

Nezznar could put out 32 damage per round if he can keep concentration on vampiric touch, but damage falls pretty quickly without that (down to offensive CR 3). I'm not too worried about it being too easy because they'll have just survived the previous fight so they should be pretty haggard by this point.

So that leaves me with one CR 6 (maybe 7) and one CR 5ish encounter right after the other with very little downtime. Is this okay? Any advice? Am I going to kill my party with this or is it relatively balanced?

&amp;#x200B;

In my upcoming campaign the party is investigating the underground depths of a massive superstructure known as the Citadel. After grinding through a planned 5-floor-deep dungeon, they will end up triggering an eldritch seal on the Citadel that causes them to be transported into a different realm. There, they will meet an ancient warrior who essentially guards this primordial force of death, a mass of the souls of everything that has died in this world, keeping it trapped underground beneath the Citadel, and that their breaking of this seal will cause this primordial force of death to eventually break free and wreak havoc on the world (dun dun DUN!).

In short, they learn of a ritual where those who trigger this seal are able to get a shot at taking the power of this force of death for themselves if they manage to get their hands on sacred artifacts held by the previous adventurers who broke the seal. However, as punishment for breaking the seal, the party members are also branded by a curse that grants them immortality, at a cost. Every time they die, they resurrect after 1d8 + (number of deaths) hours. However, each time they come back they suffer a temporary stat penalty which can be cleared by taking a long rest, though with enough deaths these penalties become permanent, with the seventh and final death causing them to go permanently insane and die for good. 

I'm wondering if anyone's tried a mechanic like this in the past. My main worry might be restricting the players from playing new characters, or the difficulty of meshing in a new character in with the party if one of the cursed members dies for good. Any thoughts? Suggestions? I'd appreciate them all.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

There, they will meet an ancient warrior who essentially guards this primordial force of death, a mass of the souls of everything that has died in this world, keeping it trapped underground beneath the Citadel, and that their breaking of this seal will cause this primordial force of death to eventually break free and wreak havoc on the world (dun dun DUN!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, they learn of a ritual where those who trigger this seal are able to get a shot at taking the power of this force of death for themselves if they manage to get their hands on sacred artifacts held by the previous adventurers who broke the seal. However, as punishment for breaking the seal, the party members are also branded by a curse that grants them immortality, at a cost. Every time they die, they resurrect after 1d8 + (number of deaths) hours. However, each time they come back they suffer a temporary stat penalty which can be cleared by taking a long rest, though with enough deaths these penalties become permanent, with the seventh and final death causing them to go permanently insane and die for good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone&amp;#39;s tried a mechanic like this in the past. My main worry might be restricting the players from playing new characters, or the difficulty of meshing in a new character in with the party if one of the cursed members dies for good. Any thoughts? Suggestions? I&amp;#39;d appreciate them all.&lt;/p&gt;

O sol e a lua amarrados na alma
(The Sun and the moon bound to the soul) 
Stats (Each) 
AC: 25 HP: 25; Resistant to all damage types Weight: 0.5
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make with these magic weapons. On a hit with these weapons, the target takes an extra 2d4 piercing damage and 2d4 elemental damage.(fire, ice) 

Soulbound 
These weapons are soulbound to you during a ritual cast by an other worldly being. To work; this ritual requires the sacrifice of two magic weapons and the owners soul. As a result the magical weapons are destroyed and the owners soul is scarred, reducing one of their stats by 1.
Once complete the weapon's binding will leave a bonding point (rune/mark), with no fixed point, on the character's body as proof of the ritual. The weapon will be made of soul stone after this point, consisting of any color, texture and shape the owner wishes. All magic imbued into the original weapon is carried over to the soul-bound form.
Any Soul-bound weapon can be summoned instantaneously, in hand, as a Reaction, at the will of the owner. The owner may disband the item and have it return instantaneously to the void or bonding point where it's rune/mark is left on the owner. The weapons may be any distance from the owner and still respond to their call. They must remain on the same plane as the owner or they will be returned to the bonding point. Soul-bound weapons can never damage their owner, if such an opportunity occurs the weapon returns to the bonding point.While you wield this weapon, you also have resistance to the relevant damage type.

Ravens flight 
While wielding one dagger, the user may throw the other as a bonus action, after which the user will instantly teleport to its location, catch it, and attack the nearest creature. If you hit with this attack, the dagger deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage. A flurry of raven feathers are left at the previous location.

Dragons Breath
You imbue yourself with the power to spew magical energy from your mouth twice a day(once fire once cold). Until the spell ends, you can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Scaling 
Because these weapons are bound to your soul they get more powerful as you do!

Unfortunately, players and DMs alike tend to flake out at random times, so we prune regularly to remove inactive people. So we're all pretty active. Fun conversation and exciting revelry await for those who are interested. We're all from different timezones so people are always available around the clock. If this sounds like your kind of adventure, please click the link below. Please be communicative and serious players. I don't mind busy schedules, but at least give prior notice before leaving.

Specifically:

* Magical Tinkering: Requires thieves' tools or artisan tools.
* Spellcasting: Requires a focus. In particular, ""You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some  kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature."" This is stronger than the language requiring other spellcasters to have a focus if they want to avoid needing other material components: an artificer *needs* a focus for *all* spells, even ones that don't have a material component, and including cantrips. Also, ""After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.""
* Infuse Item: No tools required, but you need a target: ""Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.""
* Tool Expertise: Useless without tools.
* Arcane Armament: Requires a magic weapon.
* The Right Cantrip for the Job: Useless if you can't cast cantrips because you have no tools.
* Spell-Storing Item: Requires either a weapon or a spellcasting focus.
* Soul of Artifice: Relies on magic items.
* Alchemist:
   * Alchemical Homunculus: Requires alchemist's supplies to summon or revive.
   * Alchemical Mastery: Requires alchemist's supplies.
   * Chemical Savant: Resistance always works. *Greater restoration* requires alchemist's supplies.
* Artillerist: Note that you can now use rods, staffs and wands as spellcasting focuses.
   * Arcane Turret: Requires smith's tools.
   * Wand Prototype: Requires woodcarver's tools to imbue a wand.
   * Fortified Position: Enhances Arcane Turret.

Now, I actually think that this is a good thing. If any class is going to be in trouble without their equipment, it's the artificer. I think it's interesting that they're even worse off than a wizard if they get thrown in a dungeon without their stuff.

Anyway, this has some interesting tactical implications. Firstly, it removes one of my usual reasons for taking an attack cantrip, that being ""I want to be able to fight even if I lose all my stuff"". Very few attack cantrips have material components, the exceptions being Infestation, Thorn Whip and Word of Radiance. But as an artificer, I can't cast anything at all without my tools, and if I still have my tools, I probably still have my crossbow, so attack cantrips lose some of their utility there.

Secondly, it behooves an artificer to have some kind of recovery strategy for if they lose their gear. One approach is to make sure you choose an infusion that works on a common item, since infusions don't require tools, and an infused item can be used as a spellcasting focus. The obvious way is to choose Enhanced Weapon, which many artificers will do regardless. Then, if you lose everything, you can bootstrap your way back to spellcasting by finding or making a weapon - even if that means turning a tree branch into a club - and then taking a long rest, then imbuing the weapon and using it as a focus to prepare and cast your spells. That won't let you use Magical Tinkering or any of your specialty abilities, though.

Another approach is to be proficient with a tool kit that is easily obtainable. I recommend Cook's Utensils - you can find cooking supplies in the kitchen of the nastiest orc fortress or kobold warren, and they cost one whole gold piece in the marketplace. It won't be enough for your specialty abilities, but you'll get your spellcasting back immediately.

In theory, at high levels, you could get hold of a focus (cheap tools or an imbued weapon) and then use Fabricate to create whatever tools you want, as long as you have the right proficiency to make the tools. That's probably a better bet for the Artillerist, since smith's tools would be the proficiency to make most tool kits, including more smith's tools. I can't think of any other way to obtain tools magically *ex nihilo* \- Leomund's Secret Chest requires you to have the replica chest on hand. Maybe your GM will let you use the Many-Handed Pouch infusion to add a new pouch (looted from your goblin jailer) to an existing pouch network, in which you've stored the LSC replica chest, allowing you to summon your chest which contains backup tools and other emergency supplies, but I don't think that's quite RAW.

Anyway, I just think the tool aspect of the artificer is interesting, and makes for an entertaining and intriguing new approach to spellcasting and other class features. Any thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just created a level 1 artificer for a new game, and I&amp;#39;ve noticed that they&amp;#39;re really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dependent on their tools to use their class features. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magical Tinkering: Requires thieves&amp;#39; tools or artisan tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spellcasting: Requires a focus. In particular, &amp;quot;You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some  kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature.&amp;quot; This is stronger than the language requiring other spellcasters to have a focus if they want to avoid needing other material components: an artificer &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a focus for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; spells, even ones that don&amp;#39;t have a material component, and including cantrips. Also, &amp;quot;After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infuse Item: No tools required, but you need a target: &amp;quot;Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tool Expertise: Useless without tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arcane Armament: Requires a magic weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Right Cantrip for the Job: Useless if you can&amp;#39;t cast cantrips because you have no tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spell-Storing Item: Requires either a weapon or a spellcasting focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soul of Artifice: Relies on magic items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alchemist:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alchemical Homunculus: Requires alchemist&amp;#39;s supplies to summon or revive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alchemical Mastery: Requires alchemist&amp;#39;s supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemical Savant: Resistance always works. &lt;em&gt;Greater restoration&lt;/em&gt; requires alchemist&amp;#39;s supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artillerist: Note that you can now use rods, staffs and wands as spellcasting focuses.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arcane Turret: Requires smith&amp;#39;s tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wand Prototype: Requires woodcarver&amp;#39;s tools to imbue a wand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortified Position: Enhances Arcane Turret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I actually think that this is a good thing. If any class is going to be in trouble without their equipment, it&amp;#39;s the artificer. I think it&amp;#39;s interesting that they&amp;#39;re even worse off than a wizard if they get thrown in a dungeon without their stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this has some interesting tactical implications. Firstly, it removes one of my usual reasons for taking an attack cantrip, that being &amp;quot;I want to be able to fight even if I lose all my stuff&amp;quot;. Very few attack cantrips have material components, the exceptions being Infestation, Thorn Whip and Word of Radiance. But as an artificer, I can&amp;#39;t cast anything at all without my tools, and if I still have my tools, I probably still have my crossbow, so attack cantrips lose some of their utility there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it behooves an artificer to have some kind of recovery strategy for if they lose their gear. One approach is to make sure you choose an infusion that works on a common item, since infusions don&amp;#39;t require tools, and an infused item can be used as a spellcasting focus. The obvious way is to choose Enhanced Weapon, which many artificers will do regardless. Then, if you lose everything, you can bootstrap your way back to spellcasting by finding or making a weapon - even if that means turning a tree branch into a club - and then taking a long rest, then imbuing the weapon and using it as a focus to prepare and cast your spells. That won&amp;#39;t let you use Magical Tinkering or any of your specialty abilities, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to be proficient with a tool kit that is easily obtainable. I recommend Cook&amp;#39;s Utensils - you can find cooking supplies in the kitchen of the nastiest orc fortress or kobold warren, and they cost one whole gold piece in the marketplace. It won&amp;#39;t be enough for your specialty abilities, but you&amp;#39;ll get your spellcasting back immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, at high levels, you could get hold of a focus (cheap tools or an imbued weapon) and then use Fabricate to create whatever tools you want, as long as you have the right proficiency to make the tools. That&amp;#39;s probably a better bet for the Artillerist, since smith&amp;#39;s tools would be the proficiency to make most tool kits, including more smith&amp;#39;s tools. I can&amp;#39;t think of any other way to obtain tools magically &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt; - Leomund&amp;#39;s Secret Chest requires you to have the replica chest on hand. Maybe your GM will let you use the Many-Handed Pouch infusion to add a new pouch (looted from your goblin jailer) to an existing pouch network, in which you&amp;#39;ve stored the LSC replica chest, allowing you to summon your chest which contains backup tools and other emergency supplies, but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s quite RAW.&lt;/p&gt;

For one of my most recent characters, Joe Greenglow (Enchantment Wizard) hates the Invisibility spell. This isn't because he faced invisible enemies, but because of an event in his past.

After a particular deal goes wrong (he is a charlatan), his master (uncle training him wizardry) casts the spell Invisibility on Joe, and tells him to head home. Once he made it to the front door, he spent a frustrating half hour trying to find the key he left in his pocket (it was caught on something), then another 5 minutes trying to open the door with said key.

He mostly just finds the spell inconvenient, and would just rather turn his clothing inside out and cast Alter Self. Later on, if he comes across the Invisibility spell, he would probably still record it, and maybe even prepare it, just in case. That still doesn't mean he likes it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;These can be things like a Barbarian being Hold Person&amp;#39;d too many times, to a Paladin with a hatred towards Necromancy.&lt;/p&gt;
