This is that build.

The Escape Artist skill allows you to wriggle your way out of grabs or bindings. The Escapologist rogue archetype lets you use it to:

3rd level: Unfettered Mind (Su): slip out of a mind-affecting effect as a full-round action. Let's consider this. Now I'm taking my body's ability to contort and applying that to my mind, for no good Gozreh-damn reason.

Hold Person? Until my next turn, sure. Fear effect? I'll sidestep that later. This is dumb, guys. I like it.

8th level: Impossible Escape (Su): Roll Escape Artist at -10, then use that *retroactively* as my AC, or as my Reflex save (as an immediate action, so less cheese for the rats here). It actually says that you contort yourself out of the way. This is less cool than Unfettered Mind, but more regularly applicable. ""Oh, that'll hit me for sure... guess I'll dislocate my knees so I can duck faster!"" 

Also of note: Replaces the normal Rogue Trapfinding in part; lose the bonus to Perception checks vs. traps, gain 1/2 level towards Escape Artist checks.

Queue my build:

**The Writhing Ratfolk**
FCB: 1/2 level to EA checks

Escapologist: 1/2 level to EA checks

Stealthy (feat): +2 to EA checks, +4 at later levels

Skill Focus (feat): +3 to EA checks, +6 at later levels

[Dislocate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dislocate/) (feat): Hurt yourself to lower time requirement on some EA checks. Eventually, you stop hurting yourself (good boi).

Signature Skill (feat): Just gives you a couple decent plusses to your EA skill like lowering time requirements and avoiding some effects before they happen.

Vagabond Child (Regional Trait): +1 to EA. Minor, but ~~who doesn't love a good~~ we like minor bonuses sometimes too. 

Start with a Dex of 17, get +2 from Ratfolk racial, pump that up with each level up because why not, so at level 20 you're looking at +7 there.



At this point, we're seeing a +13 to EA rolls at level 1, and a +61 to EA rolls at level 20. By level 3 we can already take 20 to get out of masterwork manacles (level one if you immediately go for Skill Focus). In 3.5, epic skill usage of EA allowed one to squeeze through a space smaller than one's own head at DC 80, and somehow friggin pass through a Wall Of Force at DC 120 (see [here](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm) for more of THAT kind of nonsense). Bear in mind, we haven't touched magic items yet. We should, but we won't in this OC. 

Other ideas of merit: 

Possessed Hand / Hand's Autonomy feats: The latter feat lets your hand act for you when you can't, sometimes. Here, it lets your hand roll any EA check for you at -4 if you couldn't already do it due to being unconscious, paralyzed, asleep, or stunned. This is now letting your demon hand force your body into contortions of both physical and mental (see Unfettered Mind) natures when you're otherwise preoccupied.

Sharptooth / Sharpclaw / Tunnel Rat / Burrowing Teeth feats: Leaning on the concept of Harry Houdini, you could go full disappearing act by learning how to tunnel on your own, too. Having a set of 3 natural weapons is already looking better than your Rogue-y BAB, just slap on a Weapon Finesse (via Finesse Rogue?) and now you've got a scrap-rat (heh). Getting out of jail is much easier when you don't need to Sleight Of Hand your weapons in! Just don't let them saw off your nat weps, mmkay? 

Skill Focus (Stealth) / Eldritch Heritage 1&amp;2 feats: Bit of a pricey feat dip here, but you have some good Stealth already so why not double dip when it comes to skills? The Shadow bloodline lets you get basically Hide In Shadow^TM with their 9th level ability, plus get 1-3/day shadowswappy Dimension Door shenanigans. Another step on the path to Houdinihood.

For instance- the Archeologist took the campaign trait that lets her read ancient scripts, while the Witch prepared Comprehend Languages. Both of them could potentially make the other's investment feel not worth it.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spoken to the players during session 0, and they know the Archeologist will be better at spotting and disabling traps and locks (and being the &amp;quot;face&amp;quot;), while the witch will supply damage/debuffs, with both having a decent utility range as well. However, I&amp;#39;m starting to worry the Witch and Archeologist will overlap too much in the &amp;quot;knowledge powerhouse&amp;quot; realm. For instance- the Archeologist took the campaign trait that lets her read ancient scripts, while the Witch prepared Comprehend Languages. Both of them could potentially make the other&amp;#39;s investment feel not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I make the knowledge/lore checks between the 2 characters feel more like a fun competition and less like one stealing the other&amp;#39;s thunder? In other words, can taking two knowledge-heavy characters be synergistic, instead of wasting potential due to the overlap?&lt;/p&gt;

A friend and I are collaborating for a couple of months, working together to make some interesting items with backstories. Sanguine Shard is the third of these. The card has cutting lines in case you want to print it.

**Additional item info**: The shard's emulsion produces an effect of euphoria based on the adrenaline in the user, and alters their taste perception, giving blood a unique and delicious taste, making everything else dull by comparison. While under its effects, and while in combat, their body comes under incredible strain (taking 1 hp/level/turn), only relieved with the shedding of others' blood, which instead heals them (same, 1hp/level/turn). The shard itself is quite fragile, and will break with a single point of damage. It must be dunked in blood and be left to drip for a week to produce enough emulsion for 1 use.

While the unicorn bloodline is also healing themed (CLW/CMW/CSW as spells known, arcana to heal allies a bit while casting any spell) at least it is not so broken as phoenix one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Bloodline Arcana**: When casting **any spell that deals fire damage**, you can instead heal your targets. The spell deals no damage, and living creatures affected by the spell **instead regain a number of** **hit points** **equal to half the fire damage** the spell would normally deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

That means that any fire spell can be a heal. While fun for blasters (half of uber optimized burning hands/scorching ray/fireball as healing), there is no clause that would protect the world from ""the healing cantrip"".

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes of thinking I see at least two ways to do it:

* Crossblooded into Elemental(fire) or Efreet to convert any damaging spell into fire
* Elemental spell metamagic + an appropriate trait

&amp;#x200B;

The spell used can be either disrupt undead (if you decide it is applicable as ""energy spell"") or a normal ray of frost/acid splash. The second option is better with blood havoc mutation (the 1lvl blood line power sucks so its no pain) + spell focus - to avoid healing 1/2 of 1 hit point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the whole thing will work as part of the blasting build - 1lvl of sorcerer / x lvls of admixture wizard etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So the result is either d6/2 (disrupt undead) or (d3+1)/2 (ray/splash + boost) of close range touch ray of healing. All at 1st level.

The second option is better with blood havoc mutation (the 1lvl blood line power sucks so its no pain) + spell focus - to avoid healing 1/2 of 1 hit point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the whole thing will work as part of the blasting build - 1lvl of sorcerer / x lvls of admixture wizard etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the result is either d6/2 (disrupt undead) or (d3+1)/2 (ray/splash + boost) of close range touch ray of healing. All at 1st level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotta say, the editing/redacting will always miss a few things. Especially if the company is obviously focused on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

But what does it do? According to the black blooded oracle text: 

&gt; casts all necromantic spells at +1 caster level for the next 10 minutes, but takes 3d6 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage

Other than drinking it, just being in contact already affects you:

&gt; certain creatures like aberrations, undead, and black-blooded oracles possess an uncanny immunity to its effects. Any other creature that comes into contact with black blood takes 1d6 points of cold damage—10d6 points of cold damage per round if fully immersed. 

That said, the little there is about it are the bloodrager bloodline and oracle archetype, which are immune to both good and bad effects of the liquid, and get a couple of slightly bad abilities related to shooting it via injuries; and a little trait that makes you immune only to the bad effects of drinking it, which is great if you ask me. But, since I already made a very nice necromancer for another game happening in Geb (bones oracle + 2 lvls of antipaladin + agent of the grave), I'm trying to come up with something else than yet necromancer, then what does that leave us with for this occasion?

First things first, what could a character be doing there? How did it arrive? What's his goal? How did he get the black blood running through its body to begin with? So far what i got is:

* A bloodrager with the said bloodline, who also has the aberrant one (crossblooded) for extra weirdness, but i still don't know what he's doing there. 
   * An experiment from a random Drow at the Bloodforge? Perhaps it was someone from Leng or a Neothelid instead? But then, how'd he get out of there to the ""starting town"" which may or may not be in orv or even the darklands? And why would he go back down there?
* Another bloodrager with the said bloodline, but this one has Eldritch Heritage with the Ghoul bloodline. 
   * This could be related to Geb, Nemret Noktoria or even Leng itself. A character can be made a ghoul (or ghast) from many reasons, of which some could be exposure to lazurite, getting done in by a marrowstone golem or more commonly dying from ghoul fever so there are many opportunities to also obtain the Ghoul Template (which sort of makes the sorcerer ghoul bloodline redundant there). So... what's next? What does he do with that? Usurp the leadership of ghouls and become ghoul king of sorts and conquer sekamina or a vault afterwards?
* A black blooded oracle... this one is a bit of a mystery, no pun intended, and disappointment. 
   * Oracles aren't very tanky HP-wise so they shouldn't be getting the injuries they need to shoot the black blood; other than that, more than half the stuff you can find down there are aberrations and undead, who are immune to it so what's the point? Also, oracle again... guess not.
* A Hallowed Necromancer wizard with the black blood heritage trait. For this i'd need to share this bit of information also from black blooded oracle:

&gt; Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source, losing all mystical properties. [*Gentle repose*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gentle-repose) can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood’s magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. 

* This guy is a diametrically opposite to most, if not all, things related to the darklands. Who wouldn't want a substance that increases necromancy-based cure spells to kill undead? There's the Cube of Writhing Glyphs too and wizards are supposed to be scholars, right? But would he go as far as going deep into orv for that? Is it worth it? Bearing in mind that I also already made an enervation build for a PC totally unrelated to this, what other necromancy spell could I even use? Are bad touch builds still a thing? 

And there ends my little list of things *directly* related to the black blood. What else can i do in that vault that's not directly related to it? 

* Fungi: It's a very common and popular thing on all the levels of the darklands, in this vault there's the Black Mire and the Hanging Forest. Possible characters: Fungal Pilgrim Druid and Blightseeker Alchemist.
* Demons: This vault is the particular location of the demonic cults to Abraxas and Camazotz (I'm not sure if there's anyone remaining of the latter though). Possible characters: Anyone who hates demons badly enough to go Jules Verne full throttle to kill them?
* ~~Cthulhu~~ Elder Mythos: A sea of unknown depth made of a mysterious substance and that seeps from the walls? Aquatic monsters, giant worms and other sort of aberrations lurking in the dark? Cult to Orgesh and faceless statues made by some unknown being? It is pretty self-explanatory, right? Although a bit broad and stretchy imho. Possible characters: Elder Mythos Scholar... and that's pretty much it since most other things cross the line into a ~~Jojo's~~ bizarre realm of insanity and paranoia ~~right next to uncle Sheogorath's islands,~~ which is sorta hard (but strangely fun) to RP and not easy to manage in a way that won't make you machinate the death of your party members for the glory of our lord and savior ~~Cthulhu~~ Orgesh.

I started by looking at the ability to simply increase healing done, and the one ability that does this well is the [Lesser Celestial Totem](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/celestial-totem-lesser-su/).

That's when I saw the 2nd Level Spell: [Boiling Blood](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/boiling-blood/).

Now, unless I'm reading something incorrectly, if you are a Phoenix Bloodline Sorcerer 1/Skald X and you cast Boiling Blood, you can grant 1 ally for every 3 Skald Levels you have the ability to heal for your Skald's Caster Level each round by spending a Standard Action to Concentrate on the spell, or simply cast it to let it run for a number of rounds equal to your Skald's Caster Level.

I feel like this is a really, really effective combination.

But for this time, i really wanted to use a class based on my ever-obsession and love for dinosaurs.
Sadly, this is my first time ever building a Druid and i'm having more than just some random doubts, as Way of the Wicked gets merciless, i get to desire a more... optimized druid if i want to be more than just a magical dinosaur that screams at the ground to grow crops.

1. [what role?]

So, with the saurian shaman i get free sacred summoning (standard action instead of full round completion when summoning) on dinosaurs and reptiles.
As any druid, i get some good spells for either control, _downtime_ and somehow damage.
I have an animal companion (see you on point 2 and 3) and lastly, i get to be considered 2 levels higher for the wild shape, which at my level (7) is considered 9 if i turn into a dinosaur which gives me huge (both technically and effectively speaking) combat advantages, expecially with Grab and Rake on a pouncing juggernaut with a +6 strenght... scary!

So... what is my role? What should i fill my 5 feat slots with aside Wild Spells? Summoning 1 extra summon with 2 str and con by using 3 feats sounds a little underwhelming until i get to summon big bad creatures like ankylos or rexes (around Lv14? That's my level x2)... Should i focus more on my ability to buff and grab with feats like Dirty Fighter, Improved Grab and Greater Grab (even if, given the campaign theme i might be forced to fancy myself a player's familiar for sneaking)? Should i still pick those 3 feats to not be disturbed on higher levels? (Spell focus conjuration as a lv11 or 9th feat can sound _SO_ frustrating!)

2. [which pet to choose?]
Since i am forced by class to pick any kind of Dinosaur and the entire campaign is from 3rd party materials , (therefore out of official restrictions and bans) i was going to pick the infamous spinosaur, with his outstanding 15-19 CON and imposing 28  STR (at lv7!)
Is it wise to base my choice on the stats of the creature or should i pick something i like more such as a Giganotosaurus or a Tylosaurus? both have Grab, could try making it work as a tandem grab with my (potential) Grapple build (depending on question 1 ofc)

3. [what companion archetype?]
Looks like normal archetype is the best so far, but are there any archetypes doing better jobs with my companions? For example, the wrecker gets great anti-construct permanent buffs for a feat that i might get them later (or not, if the creature doesn't have many attacks!), a bodyguard might protect our blaster (considering they lose evasion makes me cringe knowing we have a BLASTER)  and healer (still, we have a blaster... and nothing really unallows me to just give it the feats once he reaches INT 3, a Bully might just have greater maneuvering options for potential tandem-grappling (i think i have to count as an orc for that or is there another feat helping?)
What's the general optimizing opinion on it?
Sorry, this is mostly tied to point 2 of ""what companion should i pick?""


4. [items]
This is a little bit more Mathfinder, but skipping the obvious mighty fists, mammoth helm, lesser Extend Rod, wis +X str +X or con +X We have the wild shape and armor issue: the armor either costs too much (+4 bonus is a crime!), i can't wear it (no heavy armor proficiency) or it becomes useless as i switch between Huge to Tiny (luckily enough, we have places where to store it if i don't wear it)
So, the question is Stone Plate Barding (low cost... somehow?) or waiting for Wild Stone Plate? (Unfairly expensive with the +3 from wild, that requires a blood tribute of +1 armor so, complexively +4 armor... but once i wear it, i use it even when going at the toilet! Hell, i'm getting a wand of Iron Bed just for it!)
Right now, a stone plate with my Huge form looks just the best i could ask for since the enemy hits hard (because of the strong composition, all enemies have the Advanced template), and money are valuable for a Druid that is still in need of hos bag of seeds!!!

5. [Traits]
Druids have the best tricks: wild shape for double the amount of time if i disguise myself into a familiar (compsognathus, tuatara or rhamphoryncus and so on...) to sneak into civilized places? Calling animals CR8 to train and use to fight the forces of oppressive good? (We're an evil campaign!) but what if Call Animal didn't just really work? Like, right now we have an entire wood without a single animal because it's a desecrated land... and our DM is... kinda well known to dislike cheesing via silly buggy tricks such as gifted adept (call animal)
Considering Question 1 (role) and question 4 (items), are these good traits? Taking the form of a tiny familiar kills both the whole allosaurus-line of feats and the stoneplate non-wild-armor barding... anything else besides Reactionary?

Please, forgive my wall of text full of interruptions, i really just want to not be disappointed by this class that, in many years just seemed like the ultimate dinosaur-based class (with the pets restrictions or class restrictions, many nice martial classes just really feel wasted as Dinosaur-flavouring... not as much as Druid, i mean!), thanks for the patience of reading... and please go easy on me &gt; ^ &lt;);","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get it, a tiger druid deals more damage and is a better antimage, a summoner isn&amp;#39;t limited only to dinosaurs and a shifter probably does better at becoming a war dinosaur.

For example, the wrecker gets great anti-construct permanent buffs for a feat that i might get them later (or not, if the creature doesn&amp;#39;t have many attacks!), a bodyguard might protect our blaster (considering they lose evasion makes me cringe knowing we have a BLASTER)  and healer (still, we have a blaster... and nothing really unallows me to just give it the feats once he reaches INT 3, a Bully might just have greater maneuvering options for potential tandem-grappling (i think i have to count as an orc for that or is there another feat helping?)
What&amp;#39;s the general optimizing opinion on it?
Sorry, this is mostly tied to point 2 of &amp;quot;what companion should i pick?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[items]
This is a little bit more Mathfinder, but skipping the obvious mighty fists, mammoth helm, lesser Extend Rod, wis +X str +X or con +X We have the wild shape and armor issue: the armor either costs too much (+4 bonus is a crime!), i can&amp;#39;t wear it (no heavy armor proficiency) or it becomes useless as i switch between Huge to Tiny (luckily enough, we have places where to store it if i don&amp;#39;t wear it)
So, the question is Stone Plate Barding (low cost... somehow?) or waiting for Wild Stone Plate? (Unfairly expensive with the +3 from wild, that requires a blood tribute of +1 armor so, complexively +4 armor... but once i wear it, i use it even when going at the toilet! Hell, i&amp;#39;m getting a wand of Iron Bed just for it!)
Right now, a stone plate with my Huge form looks just the best i could ask for since the enemy hits hard (because of the strong composition, all enemies have the Advanced template), and money are valuable for a Druid that is still in need of hos bag of seeds!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Traits]
Druids have the best tricks: wild shape for double the amount of time if i disguise myself into a familiar (compsognathus, tuatara or rhamphoryncus and so on...) to sneak into civilized places? Calling animals CR8 to train and use to fight the forces of oppressive good? (We&amp;#39;re an evil campaign!) but what if Call Animal didn&amp;#39;t just really work? Like, right now we have an entire wood without a single animal because it&amp;#39;s a desecrated land... and our DM is... kinda well known to dislike cheesing via silly buggy tricks such as gifted adept (call animal)
Considering Question 1 (role) and question 4 (items), are these good traits? Taking the form of a tiny familiar kills both the whole allosaurus-line of feats and the stoneplate non-wild-armor barding... anything else besides Reactionary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, forgive my wall of text full of interruptions, i really just want to not be disappointed by this class that, in many years just seemed like the ultimate dinosaur-based class (with the pets restrictions or class restrictions, many nice martial classes just really feel wasted as Dinosaur-flavouring... not as much as Druid, i mean!), thanks for the patience of reading... and please go easy on me &amp;gt; ^ &amp;lt;);&lt;/p&gt;

I will run a session trying out the new rules with a bunch of DnD veterans. We will use the premade chars found with the new edition playtest material, as I found them very useful in the way they present information and abilities.

One question I have though is, although they show your modifier for skills etc, these character sheets dont show whether you are trained, expert etc in those respective skills. Shouldnt we have that information on the sheets? Or is it not really worth looking over when testing the game? I felt its a neat system but it will be harder to explain if they cant see how it actually works.

My husband is a really good DM and is currently running a game in roll 20 using 5e that is going very well (we’ve been playing for a year now). My husband has expressed a desire to play as a PC in a long-term game and I want to learn to DM. 2+2 = I run a game for him right?! Right. Here’s the twist: my husband loves Pathfinder, wants to run one of the Paizo APs, but I only know 5e. He really talked up Pathfinder, so I was like “Sure! I’ll learn this system so we can do this thing. Sounds fun!” We settle on Rise of the Runelords, get all the necessary book (yay humble bundle), and I’m researching away. I even ran We Be Goblins for a group of friends to try to get a feel for the system. 

After my research and the one shot I have a lot of misgivings about Pathfinder as a system. I know my husband and thousands upon thousands of people love it though, so I have to wonder if there is something that I am missing. I’ve decided to share some of my concerns here in the hopes that you fine people can help me see how these things are addressed in game mechanics or how DMs handle them in a good way. 

Stat damage/Losing a level – These two things seem like a very feel bad mechanic to me. 

I understand that in some situations these penalties are temporary, but not all of them. My main concern is that these types of mechanics seem like they would lead to a ‘death spiral.’ You fail a save, take stat or level reduction, which makes it harder for you to pass saves to either remove the damage or prevent further damage of this type. Rinse, repeat a couple times and you have gimped/useless or dead PCs.   

Move Actions – I have not been able to wrap my head around some of these. Most of them make sense, but on the whole move actions seem very restrictive. My brain just rejects the idea that a character can’t draw a weapon while walking towards an enemy. My wizard can’t fire an orison, grab a piece of paper off a desk he’s next to, then move a few feet on his turn? Grabbing a piece of paper makes it so the PC can’t move? Is this game mechanic designed this way for balance of action economy? If that is the case it seems narritively terrible ☹ 

Overall Deadly – so I’m reading through RotRL and really liking the story. Then, I come to the part 4 of book 2: Misgivings. This place seems designed to straight up kill PCs. Haunts dealing wisdom, strength, charisma damage- or that can straight up kill a PC for failed saves, multiple chances to contract Vorel’s Phage or Ghoul Fever. I'm not sure how the players are supposed to actually survive all this.

During my We Be Goblins game, I am certain if I had stuck strictly to the move action rules that the game would have been a tpk during the Vorka fight, despite good tactics on the part of the players.

Is Pathfinder simply a deadlier system than I am used to? Are PC deaths a common/expected thing?

Please understand, I’m not trying to pooh-pooh Pathfinder as a system. These are real concerns I have about these mechanics leading to playing a game that is just not fun. As such I am looking for insight into the system and how these things are handled.

They started at 3rd level - all riding up to the same crossroads at the same time - and currently the party is 18th level, adventuring inside Rovagug's cage. This past Sunday, I experienced one of those moments where things are so absurd they become awesome.

Apologies for purists about PF canon.

Let me begin with the setting.

For the sake of my game, I decided that **Rovagug**'s greatest power is that he consumes divinity. Any god in his presence is rendered mortal. If he strikes a mortal, he temporarily severs them from the ability to use or receive divine magic. It was basically impossible for the gods to kill him, because every god he killed just made him stronger. Instead of slaying him, they sealed him away in the cage in the center of Golarion. There he sleeps, and his dreams of destruction manifest as a landscape of long-dead worlds constantly being torn apart.

Though Rovagug is trapped in slumber, every once in a while a god dies on the surface of Golarion, and Rovagug draws some of that god's essence into the cage with him. If he gets enough strength, he might awaken and break free of his cage, which is why the gods generally aren't reckless enough to meddle in mortal affairs.

Another thing I added is that Asmodeus locked a legion of loyal devils inside the cage to keep tabs on the Rough Beast. They are commanded by an archdevil who had once been a duke of hell - **Egal the Shimmering**, whose purview is greed, mercenaries, and creators of magnificent treasure.

https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/738/581/large/eleni-tsami-medea.jpg?1431942393

The party had a long road getting here, and the whole tale is more complicated than is necessary to explain for this story. Suffice it to say, they're trying to rescue some innocents and stop some villains, and this next session, the world might end. 

But first, they kitted up with tons of magic items to deal with whatever they might find, and entered the cage. During a few days of exploring, they encounter remnants of long-dead gods, whose essence was pulled into the cage. They have a harrowing experience talking down **Dou-Bral** as he's trapped in a cycle slowly going mad and turning into **Zon-Kuthon** every few days. They find a shattered metal angel with a halo like an angry red eye (our play group previously played through the **Iron Gods** adventure path). They find a hollow mummy of **Ptah**, one of the Osirioni gods who never made it over from the Egyptian pantheon.

In Ptah's tomb, they found a lich named **Sorvab** who pitifully asked to die. Our Shelynite paladin, **Thaddeus**, took mercy on the thing and learned that Sorvab had once been a mortal man on a truly ancient world that Rovagug destroyed before he ever came to Golarion. Sorvab had created a minor artifact that was both a *mirror of life trapping* and a *mirror of opposition*. Made of polished gold, it would consume the soul of anyone who touched it and replace their soul with one of a diametrically opposed alignment. It could only hold one soul at a time.

He had offered it as a gift to Egal the Shimmering, hoping to get Hell's assistance in saving his world. Instead, Egal tested the mirror on Sorvab, creating a loyal minion, whom he commanded to become a lich so he could serve forever. When Rovagug threatened Golarion and Asmodeus set Egal to the task of controlling the inside of the cage, Sorvab came too. He lacked the mindless discipline of the devils, so he started to go mad and deserted, fleeing into a distant spot in the nightmarish landscape within the cage. Now he simply wanted to die, to have his phylactery destroyed, because he was convinced he would never escape.

Thaddeus offered instead to recover the mirror and restore Sorvab's soul, and perhaps make him alive again. 

To reach the people they wanted to rescue, the paladins would have to make it past the Golden Legion anyway, and so Tad hoped he would find the mirror in their fortress. When they approached the fortress, they were met by a messenger carrying a big cauldron of gold coins. He poured them out, and they levitated, forming Egal the Shimmering's face. To the party's surprise, Egal said he didn't care if they went any further, as long as they didn't interfere with Asmodeus's plans: namely, don't free Rovagug.

Since apparently a fight wasn't going to happen, Tad asked if maybe they could buy something from him. A bit of bartering later, and the party trades a few hundred thousand GP worth of stuff for the mirror. With surprisingly little fanfare, they let Sorvab touch the mirror, which obliterates his lich body and replaces it with his mortal body and his original, not-evil soul. 

Riding high on their victory (and high on their horses), the paladins travel past the fortress of the golden legion to their ultimate destination, a palace that holds a prisoner they intend to rescue. Here's where I make a silly error.

They find a sword on the ground with a green crystal blade, and beside it a cracked statue of an imposing man with Azlanti features. They realize this is a fragment of Aroden. Whatever may have killed him, a piece of him ended up here.

I'm just thinking, hey, this will be a fun bit of mystery, because they'll know Aroden is dead, but still won't know why. It's a big part of the setting, and even now, the answer is hidden from them.

The paladin of Ra, **Akhenra**, pipes up that he has a *scroll of true resurrection*, which works as long as the person died in the past 170 years. Aroden died 111 years ago.

Someone points out that he's not just dead; he's petrified.

Don't worry, says Akhenra. My *lay hands* can cure petrification through a mercy.

I decide at that point that one of the things Asmodeus definitely doesn't want is Aroden coming back, even as a mortal, to make trouble. So the Golden Legion starts lopping trebuchet buckets of lava at the party, which arc for a few miles and start landing around them. They are not deterred, however, and restore Aroden from petrification, then abscond with his body to a safe distance, at which point they revive him. He has lost his divine powers, but he's still, like, canonically a very high level spellcaster, and I figure he's wished himself to have super high stats.

Of course they ask him how he died. So I kinda broke a cardinal rule of the PF setting by answering that. Oops?

He's disturbingly *not* selfless, but he's certainly got a grudge against Hell. So they make a plan to storm the Golden Legion's fortress.

The crux of that plan is this. Aroden disguises everyone with *invisibility* and *mind blank* from a distance, they fly into Egal's throne room with flight magic on their steeds and such, and then they kick ass. A group of 20th level paladins do a *number* on a throne room filled with high-level devils -- Akhenra solos a pit fiend over the span of two turns, Thaddeus and his horse both with Combat Reflexes tear apart a phalanx of bearded devils, our archer **Marthel** kills some invisible horned devils, and so on. 

And then there's Egal the Shimmering, with basically the statblock of CR 25 Amon, Duke of Hell (3rd party - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc), plus I added some special powers like conjuring a treasure hoard avalanche, and greedily copying any spells other casters use around him. The fiend is exceptionally powerful. But even exceptionally powerful dukes of hell can fail saving throws.

So when the rest of the party is distracting him, Egal doesn't notice Aroden run up beside him, take the golden mirror like a two handed bludgeon, and bonk the archdevil in the face. One shitty saving throw later, and the party has a freshly minted Chaotic Good empyreal lord on their side.

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin with the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of my game, I decided that &lt;strong&gt;Rovagug&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s greatest power is that he consumes divinity. Any god in his presence is rendered mortal. If he strikes a mortal, he temporarily severs them from the ability to use or receive divine magic. It was basically impossible for the gods to kill him, because every god he killed just made him stronger. Instead of slaying him, they sealed him away in the cage in the center of Golarion. There he sleeps, and his dreams of destruction manifest as a landscape of long-dead worlds constantly being torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Rovagug is trapped in slumber, every once in a while a god dies on the surface of Golarion, and Rovagug draws some of that god&amp;#39;s essence into the cage with him. If he gets enough strength, he might awaken and break free of his cage, which is why the gods generally aren&amp;#39;t reckless enough to meddle in mortal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I added is that Asmodeus locked a legion of loyal devils inside the cage to keep tabs on the Rough Beast. They are commanded by an archdevil who had once been a duke of hell - &lt;strong&gt;Egal the Shimmering&lt;/strong&gt;, whose purview is greed, mercenaries, and creators of magnificent treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/738/581/large/eleni-tsami-medea.jpg?1431942393""&gt;https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/738/581/large/eleni-tsami-medea.jpg?1431942393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party had a long road getting here, and the whole tale is more complicated than is necessary to explain for this story. Suffice it to say, they&amp;#39;re trying to rescue some innocents and stop some villains, and this next session, the world might end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, they kitted up with tons of magic items to deal with whatever they might find, and entered the cage. During a few days of exploring, they encounter remnants of long-dead gods, whose essence was pulled into the cage. They have a harrowing experience talking down &lt;strong&gt;Dou-Bral&lt;/strong&gt; as he&amp;#39;s trapped in a cycle slowly going mad and turning into &lt;strong&gt;Zon-Kuthon&lt;/strong&gt; every few days. They find a shattered metal angel with a halo like an angry red eye (our play group previously played through the &lt;strong&gt;Iron Gods&lt;/strong&gt; adventure path). They find a hollow mummy of &lt;strong&gt;Ptah&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the Osirioni gods who never made it over from the Egyptian pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ptah&amp;#39;s tomb, they found a lich named &lt;strong&gt;Sorvab&lt;/strong&gt; who pitifully asked to die. Our Shelynite paladin, &lt;strong&gt;Thaddeus&lt;/strong&gt;, took mercy on the thing and learned that Sorvab had once been a mortal man on a truly ancient world that Rovagug destroyed before he ever came to Golarion. Sorvab had created a minor artifact that was both a &lt;em&gt;mirror of life trapping&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;mirror of opposition&lt;/em&gt;. Made of polished gold, it would consume the soul of anyone who touched it and replace their soul with one of a diametrically opposed alignment. It could only hold one soul at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had offered it as a gift to Egal the Shimmering, hoping to get Hell&amp;#39;s assistance in saving his world. Instead, Egal tested the mirror on Sorvab, creating a loyal minion, whom he commanded to become a lich so he could serve forever. When Rovagug threatened Golarion and Asmodeus set Egal to the task of controlling the inside of the cage, Sorvab came too. He lacked the mindless discipline of the devils, so he started to go mad and deserted, fleeing into a distant spot in the nightmarish landscape within the cage. Now he simply wanted to die, to have his phylactery destroyed, because he was convinced he would never escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thaddeus offered instead to recover the mirror and restore Sorvab&amp;#39;s soul, and perhaps make him alive again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach the people they wanted to rescue, the paladins would have to make it past the Golden Legion anyway, and so Tad hoped he would find the mirror in their fortress. When they approached the fortress, they were met by a messenger carrying a big cauldron of gold coins. He poured them out, and they levitated, forming Egal the Shimmering&amp;#39;s face. To the party&amp;#39;s surprise, Egal said he didn&amp;#39;t care if they went any further, as long as they didn&amp;#39;t interfere with Asmodeus&amp;#39;s plans: namely, don&amp;#39;t free Rovagug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since apparently a fight wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen, Tad asked if maybe they could buy something from him. A bit of bartering later, and the party trades a few hundred thousand GP worth of stuff for the mirror. With surprisingly little fanfare, they let Sorvab touch the mirror, which obliterates his lich body and replaces it with his mortal body and his original, not-evil soul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding high on their victory (and high on their horses), the paladins travel past the fortress of the golden legion to their ultimate destination, a palace that holds a prisoner they intend to rescue. Here&amp;#39;s where I make a silly error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They find a sword on the ground with a green crystal blade, and beside it a cracked statue of an imposing man with Azlanti features. They realize this is a fragment of Aroden. Whatever may have killed him, a piece of him ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just thinking, hey, this will be a fun bit of mystery, because they&amp;#39;ll know Aroden is dead, but still won&amp;#39;t know why. It&amp;#39;s a big part of the setting, and even now, the answer is hidden from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paladin of Ra, &lt;strong&gt;Akhenra&lt;/strong&gt;, pipes up that he has a &lt;em&gt;scroll of true resurrection&lt;/em&gt;, which works as long as the person died in the past 170 years. Aroden died 111 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone points out that he&amp;#39;s not just dead; he&amp;#39;s petrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry, says Akhenra. My &lt;em&gt;lay hands&lt;/em&gt; can cure petrification through a mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide at that point that one of the things Asmodeus definitely doesn&amp;#39;t want is Aroden coming back, even as a mortal, to make trouble. So the Golden Legion starts lopping trebuchet buckets of lava at the party, which arc for a few miles and start landing around them. They are not deterred, however, and restore Aroden from petrification, then abscond with his body to a safe distance, at which point they revive him. He has lost his divine powers, but he&amp;#39;s still, like, canonically a very high level spellcaster, and I figure he&amp;#39;s wished himself to have super high stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they ask him how he died. So I kinda broke a cardinal rule of the PF setting by answering that. Oops?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s disturbingly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; selfless, but he&amp;#39;s certainly got a grudge against Hell. So they make a plan to storm the Golden Legion&amp;#39;s fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of that plan is this. Aroden disguises everyone with &lt;em&gt;invisibility&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mind blank&lt;/em&gt; from a distance, they fly into Egal&amp;#39;s throne room with flight magic on their steeds and such, and then they kick ass. A group of 20th level paladins do a &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; on a throne room filled with high-level devils -- Akhenra solos a pit fiend over the span of two turns, Thaddeus and his horse both with Combat Reflexes tear apart a phalanx of bearded devils, our archer &lt;strong&gt;Marthel&lt;/strong&gt; kills some invisible horned devils, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s Egal the Shimmering, with basically the statblock of CR 25 Amon, Duke of Hell (3rd party - &lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc""&gt;https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc&lt;/a&gt;), plus I added some special powers like conjuring a treasure hoard avalanche, and greedily copying any spells other casters use around him. The fiend is exceptionally powerful. But even exceptionally powerful dukes of hell can fail saving throws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the rest of the party is distracting him, Egal doesn&amp;#39;t notice Aroden run up beside him, take the golden mirror like a two handed bludgeon, and bonk the archdevil in the face. One shitty saving throw later, and the party has a freshly minted Chaotic Good empyreal lord on their side.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I think we need to decide on some general principles going forward.  Without risk of death/loss, I feel the game has less meaning.  On the flip side, if there's, say, four boss fights per level and you succeed 95% of the time, that's likely several more TPKs by the end of the campaign (this is assuming you never die to lesser encounters which technically could also happen).  There's at least three main options: 

&amp;#x200B;

1, ""IT WAS ALL A DREAM!"" I don't really like this option, I think it cheapens death and makes failing meaningless.

&amp;#x200B;

2, reset but with consequences.  people have mentioned the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor.  In this case it would probably be something like the encounter you just wiped to getting a small boost across the board while you get a second chance.  If you die again, it gets boosted more.  if this happens a few times it's going to become impossible and it becomes a TPK.  So you get a few chances but that's it -- and it's a bit harder each time.

&amp;#x200B;

3, TPKs are TPKs.  If the party is wiped out, that's that.  New party (or if one person escaped then most of a new party or whatever).

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the concern here is also disruption of plotlines.  If one person dies (falls into lava and there's nothing left to rez, let alone raise dead) then that can already disrupt stuff and that's ""good"" because death should be meaningful...but it's a far cry short of jettisoning every NPC connection/character arc and resetting with a new party.

The set-up is that my players are about halfways through the first book still.

So by my understanding, when the lizards do a group shock the players will have to roll a DC of 22 or take 12d8 damage. 

Here's my question. How does this attack happen? Say I roll that the lizards can shock every 2 rounds. On the first Lizard's first turn does he activate this attack and then all the Lizards turns are skipped because he used this attack? Or would it be more like all the lizards aid the last lizard and he activates it? 
Or do all the lizards get separate attacks? Or do I for that one round have them attack as though they were a swarm? I am unsure how this works.

Thanks all.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My players are currently going through RoTR campaign. I am reading one of the encounters from the Hook Mountain book and came accross the Shocker Lizard&amp;#39;s. This room has 12 shocker lizards in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bestiary 1 PG 248 states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shock (Su) Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock
to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8
points of nonlethal electricity damage to living
opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). This save DC
is Constitution-based. Additionally, if
two or more shocker lizards are within
20 feet of each other, they can work
together to create a lethal shock once
every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a
radius of 20 feet, centered on any
one contributing lizard. All creatures
within that radius take 2d8 points
of lethal electricity damage for each
lizard contributing to the shock, to
a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save
(DC 10 + the number of lizards
contributing) halves the damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by my understanding, when the lizards do a group shock the players will have to roll a DC of 22 or take 12d8 damage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my question. How does this attack happen? Say I roll that the lizards can shock every 2 rounds. On the first Lizard&amp;#39;s first turn does he activate this attack and then all the Lizards turns are skipped because he used this attack? Or would it be more like all the lizards aid the last lizard and he activates it? 
Or do all the lizards get separate attacks? Or do I for that one round have them attack as though they were a swarm? I am unsure how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all.&lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance

Ornate armor covers this hulking creature, rocky protrusions jutting from its hide and fierce horns crowning its broad head.
  

####CR   20
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Gargantuan
####Special Abilities  

Armor Training (Ex) An akvan is created wearing armor, and is naturally experienced in its use. An akvan possesses the armor training ability of a 15th-level fighter.

Aura of Hopelessness (Su) All creatures except divs within 30 feet of an akvan must make a successful DC 30 Will save or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Create Ghul (Su) Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Shake Faith (Su) Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Torturous Gullet (Su) As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan’s stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well.

Akvans seek out wonders to destroy—monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan’s evil does not end with its victim’s death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield—or are belched up from an akvan’s gullet—as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves.

Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile.

Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds.
Akvan Princes
As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes.

Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4–8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22­–24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts.

Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish.

Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains resist fire 30, an efreeti’s heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like abilities: at will—quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day—wish.

Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will—invisibility; 3/day—gaseous form, wish.

Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid’s water’s fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like abilities: constant—water breathing, water walk; at will—quickened control water; 3/day—horrid wilting, wish.

Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity 20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will—ethereal jaunt, invisibility; 3/day—insanity, mage’s disjunction, wish.

&amp;#x200B;

But what you should do is take a look at what the token art the other PCs are using is and use that to temper your expectations or even determine if that game is right for you before you even post an Player App in the LFG.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you found this art of a grizzled barbarian warrior drawn in a hyper realistic style and it's cool and you love it....but maybe it's not the right thing for the game of Magical Girl Princess Power. The inverse also being true, I've had dozens and dozens of people post 12 year old anime girls to the LFG pages of my dark gothic horror games. And maybe those apps are REALLY GREAT CHARACTERS that I want in my game very much and maybe the players are the best around, but seeing this Loli nestled in with dour steampunk oil stained hardarses just....well it draws me out and makes me warry of that character. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it doesn't even have to be a tonal thing. You maybe love drawing your own tokens but your art skills are.....not quite there yet. It can unintentionally give a bad impression when you post this stick figure in with the group of guys who spent a couple hundred dollars each to have their tokens custom made by professional artists. 

&amp;#x200B;

and then there's sexual content, Maybe you think that loin clothed, pasties on her boobs, elf wench is really awesome, but maybe the group just isn't really going for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make isn't "" Your wrong to post that "" my point isn't "" Lol Anime sucks get it out of here "" rather the point I want to make is that pictures speak a thousand words and when I see your token, more so than alot of your backstory is going to color my impression of your character and you as a player and when I'm sifting through a dozen applications that can make a very big difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this goes both ways also! Maybe you want that anime ninja character or that guy who's got a flaming sword and armor and glowing eyes and lightning bolt cape at level 1. Looking at the token art other people post can give you a good impression if it's worth posting in that LFG, See a bunch of other Anime portraits? Your gonna feel right at home!

My group of friends is trying it out to see how we like it, and I've decided to make a character inspired by Dante (from the Devil May Cry series.png) using the Synthesist Summoner. As you can imagine with all of the required reading and lack of experience, I'm having a hard time deciding on the fine details of my build and would like some guidance. I'm not looking to make the most optimized character or a 1:1 rendition of Dante, just something conceptually close: a fun loving melee combatant with a huge sword, a devil trigger, and a handful of tricks up his sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've decided on Demon Spawn Tiefling for my race. My GM is allowing me to trade in some stuff to get that trait that lets Tieflings wield larger weapons. With 20 point buy my stats pre-racials are 14 12 12 7 14 16 in that order. Also of note, since I have no interest in actually summoning anything aside from my refluffed Eidilon, my GM has allowed me to trade out access to summoning spells as well as the Summon Monster SLA for extra feats when I would otherwise upgrade Summon Monster. Not sure how (un)balanced that is, but it seemed the simplest solution.

&amp;#x200B;

The two areas I'm most uncertain of is how high of an emphasis I need to place on my charisma score, and also the main form of attack for my fused state. I don't plan to cast much outside of utility and buff spells, so I imagine I don't need my charisma score all that high; however, I'm unfamiliar with the system as a whole so I don't know if there's a reason I shouldn't leave my charisma sitting around 18. As for modes of attack, I'm definitely going biped with manufactured weapons and at least one big sword. My initial conception was having four arms to two hand a greatsword while also having two free hands for casting, but I'm also considering wielding x number of greatswords. I can't picture my devil trigger state having a ton of arms, and I'm not even sure how effective that is in the first place, so insight is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Also there are a ton of feats, and aside from the Dimensional Dervish tree I'm not even sure what I want or need to take.

My GM is pretty good and we can talk with him about a lot of things. Except fumble rules.

I'm ok with that, still hurts builds needing weapons or attack rolls more but I can live with that.  


What I just don't like is that he wants to have fumbles for skill checks, without confirmation, because otherwise there ""wouldn't be so many fumbles"". That lead to my ranger lvl 3, sneak bonus of +9, to yell for my bow in the midst of the night (Nat 1, instead of just getting it ready with stealthiness of 10) while 4 goblins were under our tent ""city"" in the trees. Since the skill check fumble rate will always be a flat 5 %, regardless of being a commoner or a lvl 20 master hunter,  I'm looking for builds that either aren't subject to these rules that let me feel like a dumbass trying to do heroic things as often or something else to mitigate these effects in any way.  


I will definitely bring it up next time at the full table that it bothers me, including me deciding for my character that he was ordered home for orc-reasons (dwarf) if this rule will stay. I would like to play a character that I can get invested to, that's why I'm looking for builds/guides/tips/tricks/whatever to not fail miserably 5 % of the times. I have no problem with failing at all, that can be fun as well, but failing miserably every 20th time isn't as heroic as I would like to play. It just isn't fun for me (at least my GM has fun describing it). Otherwise I will play the human fighter John Doe the I.

I'm trying to find a player template to create a Natural Werebear. Does anyone know what the mechanics would be in regards to HP (as in would the PC's health reset to the Werebear's form or would the modified HP just be reduced per damage sustained)?

I realize that a werebear can be pretty over-powered so I am mulling over a few mechanics to compensate for that (e.g. Will save after sustaining a critical to maintain control/prevent transformation).

Any links or suggestions will be appreciated!

There is a lot of argument on how the blade adept works.

So here goes (Please note that this is not in terms of PFS but home games):

1) The blade adept's black blade cannot be enhanced, like the magus's black blade, correct? This is despite this being a bonded object? This is to avoid an enhancement issues for game mechanics, correct?

2) Does the black blade maintain any enhancement prior to becoming a black blade?

3) The arcanist's arcane reservoir replaces the magus's arcane pool. How is the arcane reservoir points calculated? 3 + arcanist level or 1/3 arcanist level + intelligence (because of the black blade feature)?

4) The magus feature is described as the arcane pool. If the arcanist's reservoir replaces the arcane pool, can the arcanist use the reservoir to enhance the black blade like how the magus can enhance the black blade?  The black blade has it's own arcane pool.  Can you use it to enhance the black blade?

5) Why pick blade adept over vmc magus? They appear to have roughly the same amount of tradeoffs and benefits. For every increase to the black blade, vmc magus can also enhance the weapon, but do it better and with any weapon. The lost feats were likely to be spent on metamagic or item creation, which can be acquired through the arcanist exploits you saved.

Basically, from what I've seen:

Blade adept:   
\- 3 exploits   
\- Eldritch Blade   
\- Spell Strike

VMC Magus:   
\- 3 exploits (metamagic)   
\- Broad Study   
\- Trade in for Spell Strike   
\- No sentient weapon bonuses - Trade for familiar?

Both of these allow me to get Arcane Accuracy which was the biggest appeal to me.

Accurate strike from VMC is also pretty appealing.  

I can see giving up spellstrike to reduce the cost of the archetype.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue/argument arose when I attempted my first Heal check to treat deadly wounds in combat on our fighter. Against a DC20 check, my resulting Heal check was 43  \[18 (roll) + 14 (Heal skill) + 2 (Satchel) + 4 (Satchel wisdom bonus) + 5 (Knowledge Planes ranks)\]. DM first thought I counted wrong (I double checked), then accused me of using 3rd party material (I didn't), and then accused me of Power gaming to the point of breaking the game with the help of online forums (. . .I did utilize the help of the interwebs).

Did I do anything wrong? Did I go too far?? I argued back that everyone else has done something similar (including the DM with EVERY character), I was just the first one to do it with Heal checks. Thoughts?!  


Edit: it was mentioned I originally had too many Revelations, corrected after a long internal deliberation!!

 My first instinct as an Arcanist is to nope the hell out of there with my companions, so Dimensional Slide, Swift Action Bloodline Development Vestige Bloodline to use a bound item to cast Teleportation to get me and my friends to a safe place.

While this is the main plan, I doubt everyone in going to be in range of my teleportation spell (the paladin and the warrior might be 20 fts apart from each other), and so I asked myself, if I use a Reach Metamagic Rod (or the feat), does it increase the range of people I can teleport from Touch to Close? Or is the Teleportation range that gets increased? By RAW I would say the first since the ""range"" is ""personal and touch"", but later the spells specify that there is need of contact between the targets.

Edit: I'll add that the Reach Spell feats specify that you can't apply it to spells that lack the range of Touch, Close or Medium, and since the Teleport ""travel range"" is none of these, I suspect that you can't increase it with said feat, leaving the ""personal and touch"" the only increasable part, but the need of contact still confuses me.

So to start I threw them all into jail together as an obligatory sticking them together to avoid the tavern of awkward. There were a few things to do in the jail as I burned down the village they were in around them to establish some immediate tension. 

 Immediately two of them start putting out fires and the wizard decides to go look for a shop cause he loves fucking with rich assholes. But everything is on fire so yeah stuff happens and some raiders are robbing a store and he stops them. Then steals the stuff they're stealing. 

So we go back to the two putting fires out and they go on and save a bunch of people from burning buildings rather than fight the pillagers with the guards. They're not a very combat orientated group. 

Eventually things calm down and all the saved people vouch for the party so the guards pardon them and let them go. At this point the party introduces themselves to each other and go get drink in a tavern for shenanigans. 

The wizard checks his items he stole and discovers a bag of gold, a bag of uncut gems, and a bag of magic dust for an unknown use. But he also notices that there is also ordinary sand in the bag. So he goes off to the shop he stole it from and blackmails the shopkeep into buying his silence for conning people. 

We take a short break around this time because I expected the prison break to take longer and have to plan some on the fly shit now. 

We come back from the break and one of them suggests talking to the captain of the guard about the raid. They discover through some rp that this is a common occurrence and the raiders are in fact slavers who kidnapped the blacksmith's daughter. 

After talking to the blacksmith and another guard they get the girl's description and a possible location for the slavers. 

Next they decide to gather supplies for the trip so they go and visit that shopkeeper that the wizard stole from earlier. After a bit of rp and haggling they get some legitimate supplies and head off to the cave. 

They get to the cave and there are two slavers keeping watch. They develope a plan and it almost works. But then everything went wrong. The rogue missed the sneak attack, the illusionists spell failed, and the excleric couldn't get in fast enough with their heavy armor.

Now the baddies inside are definitely aware of the attackers and I've got some plans for the inside of the cave which I will run them through next week.

The issue is that she has been Aldern's obsession. He started out being a bit too clingy to her and inappropriately giving her all the credit for saving him. They chose not to go on the boar hunt as they had a feeling he was creepy and it was a trap. After that though he left a gift of a masterwork composite longbow for her when he left and has not returned. I have played up small items of hers having gone missing as well... but no one really seemed to notice for too long as other events just kept occuring. During the downtime between adventures she even talked about maybe looking him up... she had definitely come to think of him more fondly when nothing bad had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

With her leaving I am really disappointed both that all of that foreshadowing and setup went in to setting her up as the perfect target of his obsession as well as now having lost the opportunity to make it be whomever I am going to have to target next... just bummed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... other suggestions? I hate killing off a character after their player leaves the game, but it seems that Aldern letting his obsession get to him might be the perfect thing. She just goes missing and no one knows where she is. When they get to the mansion they see painting that look almost just like her (she described her character very similar to what Iesha looks like in the art)... then they find her body when they get down stairs to finally confront Aldern along with the table holding all of the little curious of hers he had acquired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another possibility that occurred to me was actually replacing Iesha with her. She had a whirlwind romance after the last adventure, got married and things played out very similarly. Not sure I like this though as it messes with the timeline and opens a lot of questions... like why the PCs weren't invited to any wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I need to pick a new obsession. I have never liked the non-lust options as much and especially with no time to prep any foreshadowing... I am more at a loss of how to proceed. I suppose it could be fun to try and frame one of the characters for the murders as time goes on... maybe the low RP halfling cavalier. Not sure if that would really help pull the player in more or be something he just doesn't care about.

I've been extensively researching my spell choices online and as the game has progressed I find myself drifting away more and more from some universally praised choices like Fireball, Stinking Cloud, and Stone Call. Black tentacles is in reach now but I just don't see myself taking it, despite how great it sounds. It just feels like a waste of a slot when I'm unlikely to have a good opportunity to cast it without hitting my allies.

My party (monk, ranger, rogue, bard) has pretty high initiative, and while mine is up among the highest, more often than not at least one ally is in the way of AoE when my turn comes. Worse still, the Spire in general seems like a pretty cramped place. Usually when combat starts, we're already too close to the enemy for a fireball or a cloud, even if I asked whoever is ahead of me to delay.

That's not to say I never use AoEs. Early on I got a few good color sprays off. And there was one boss encounter I managed to launch a fireball from a scroll to good effect. But nine times out of ten, it just ain't happening. Because of this, I find myself taking more targeted spells like Burning Arc, Slow, and Icy Spears and not picking up Fireball, Stinking Cloud, or Black Tentacles. I've had Web for a few sessions but still haven't had a good chance to use it.

Now, I'm not complaining per say. I don't have any regrets (other than not realizing how many more spells I would know if my PC were human). I'm pretty happy with my spell choices and our party has been doing well. **I'm just curious why my experience seems so different than most I've read.**

Is the Emerald Spire just too cramped? Am I missing some tactical options? (I know of the selective spell feat, but I'm still not high enough level to meet the prerequisite.)

My dilemma is that I'm not sure about how to approach the game with them. I have written two brief intro adventures that will give me the option of doing either:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Giving the players a choice of pre-gen characters, including background story, character traits, objectives etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Giving them blank slate characters that are basically 'fresh souls' in story terms and have no experiential memories (although their bodies retain some 'muscle memory' that explains their skills/knowledges/abilities etc - there is then future RP potential for discovering who their body was via physical characteristics (tattoos, being recognised, etc) that becomes part of the story). This lets me, as GM, guide them in situations in a more seamless, narrative way (ie, something tells you that you could probably balance across this narrow ledge etc).

The basic concept is that you take a half-orc or orc archer(doesn't seem to matter a huge deal what the base class is) and through use of other character buffs or item buffs you make something truly disgusting.   


First step is to give our monstrosity a Orc Hornbow(2d6). Step 2 is to cast enlarge person on him, he becomes large sized, and so with his new size his bow would go up to a Large sized Orc Hornbow(3d6). Through further magic, we apply the Gravity bow spell and now the Large Orc Hornbow counts as one size larger for damage(4d6). I am pretty certain at this point we are still RAW, however we can go further and I am wondering if this crosses the line.  


If our Orc siege weapon here were to get an enchantment of Growing Weapon on his bow, then we are looking at a Large Orc Hornbow, that for 10 minutes a day he can make a Huge Orc Hornbow(6d6) and use without penalty. If we want to get even more wonky the Orc Archer could use a Large Hornbow from the get go, sure he takes a -2 but think of the pay off when we apply all our buffs and the final result is a Large Orc wielding a Huge Growing Orc Hornbow with gravity bow on top of it for 8d6 per arrow.

####Appearance  

A contemplative humanoid face framed by a cobra-like hood adorns the body of this long, brightly colored serpent.

####CR   10
#####Alignment:  LG
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Poison (Ex) Bite—injury or spit—contact; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spells A guardian naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a guardian naga.

Spit (Ex) A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobra-like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds.

While many guardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder—towering waterfalls, natural spires, mountaintop temples—minding them out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder’s charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.

&lt;p&gt;This is what I’ve come up with so far. Sorry for deleting the post I just made about this before I found the brawler lol. But is this viable/even scary? What would the actual damage dice be at this point? (If I’m doing my damage scaling correctly, if I have monk robes at level 16, I should be doing 32D8s per hit) Do you have any recommendations to make it better? What would I even use martial flexibility for, if anything? &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

The feat theoretically has a niche fulfilling a specific fantasy, that of the powerful warrior who finishes off foes [in a single blow](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F20KSmo8aJ7HYu5L0rf%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;f=1). You don't need a second hit--one is enough. It's pretty badass if you can pull it off.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend Bob sees the feat and he thinks ""wow, I'd love to make a character centered around that!"" Bob proceeds to use the feat chain as a build-around. He goes out of his way to find the largest possible weapons, invests in the whole feat chain, picks up other feats to support the strategy, and then spends every possible round of combat vital-striking.

&amp;#x200B;

This build is bad bad bad. A vital strike is not as good as a full-attack action in most cases. Bob gets screwed over by effects like *blur* or *mirror* image. There will be turns when Bob naturally rolls low on the d20, effectively loses all his attacks for the turn, and feels bad. And even if Bob hits, the payoff isn't really there; it probably doesn't deal more damage per round than a full attack even in the best case scenario. The feat simply isn't good enough to support an entire character concept.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's secretly a great utility feat. Rather than making it a build-around, you can slap it onto martial characters for circumstantial value.

&amp;#x200B;

The first use for the feat is mobility. Combat in Pathfinder typically rewards martial characters for planting their feet and full-attacking. And one of the advantages that casters have over warriors is the ability to cast their spell for the round and then move, getting the most out of their action economy without compromising their effectiveness. Vital strike stretches out your action economy, allowing you to move without missing out on the entire value of a full attack. If moving and then attacking is two actions, think of moving and then using a vital strike as 2.5 actions.

&amp;#x200B;

How to benefit from the mobility? Finish off an injured enemy and then start moving on to the next one. Use it instead of a charge action, to deal more damage when the enemy has low AC, or when the terrain doesn't allow charging. Walk around the enemy's cover and then shoot them with a vital strike musket ball. Or hit a powerful enemy and then walk away to bait out its AoO for the turn.

&amp;#x200B;

The second use is damage reduction. Ideally you'd get around DR by using the correct weapons. But sometimes you won't have a silver holy bullet when you entered the dungeon prepared to fight fairies, and found devils instead. That's ok--vital strike is naturally good against DR.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, vital strike can be great for the surprise round. The goal of a good ambush is to end the battle before it begins, but this is often difficult in Pathfinder. Sometimes there are low-HP, high-value targets who need to die in a single round. Sentries will survive the first hit and raise an alarm, or wizards will survive and teleport away. Vital strike isn't a silver bullet to this problem, but it helps. You can't take a full attack action in the surprise round anyway, so vital strike can be another way to turn your one standard action into 1.5 standard actions. Some characters like rangers or slayers may be able to creep all the way up into melee before combat begins. Archers and gunslingers may get off a vital strike shot from concealment before combat begins. If you have a stealthy martial character, consider taking this feat.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

&amp;#x200B;

**The best thing about vital strike** is that it can be made to do a lot of work for a small investment. Picking up a single feat (or maybe two, if you're a fighter with feats to spare) is enough to generate value in a wide variety of circumstances. Just be sure you use it judiciously, and not as your main mode of attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**The worst thing about vital strike** is that it doesn't do a very good job of supporting the fantasy that it represents. Bob will probably never chop a pit fiend in half with one blow, and he'll sacrifice a lot of power in the futile quest to do so. He may land OHKOs on weak enemies, but it won't support an entire character concept the way that he wants it to, unless he plays at a really-power table.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat/""&gt;Vital strike&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#39;t exactly bad so much as it is a victim of its own coolness.&lt;/p&gt;

A mystery to crack!

When they woke up fearsome Arkryst

Who thought “I could use a snack”

And the dragon breathed his wrath on them

A mighty, icy sneeze!

Never thinking that that was the day

That’d he be killed with bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

The heroes reeled and scattered

Any lesser folk would crumble

As the dragon eyed their haunches

With his belly all a’rumble

And as he drifted out of reach

Of bear and orc with ease

He thought “There’s no way this is the day

That I’ll be killed with bees”

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

They might have died right then and there

But Prinella got to healin’

And Hamphrey conjured figments

Of some folk doin’ some stealin’

And Kieran conjured up a wall

Of unseen energies

Feared no blades or spells or bees

The bear and orc got in some licks

The beast was not impressed

And he looked upon his quarries

To see which would taste the best

He snatched up Kieran in his jaws

Thinking “Tastes a bit like cheese,”

And breathed a final icy blast

Before he died from bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

Then Pow’ll and Hamphrey linked their hands

And with great courageous flare

Did teleport athwart its back

As it sped on through the air

“I will not die from stabbings by

Such nasty mites as these!”

He cried, when Pow’ll struck – correct!

For he would die from bees.

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

Kieran took the final key,

By Prinella’s grace, alive

And Arkryst tried to crush his foes

In a final fatal dive

But they dove clear, and ere his foes

He with his breath could freeze

The halfling nocked his swarmbow:

They killed the beast with bees.

With seven magic keys,

And faced in ancient Runeforge

Many stranger things than these

But of all their tales, as scary

And as thrilling as you please,

&lt;p&gt;When they woke up fearsome Arkryst&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; It's basically some level-1 commoners vs a D10000 random magical effect table. Don't roll 9999.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be running it in a few weeks but I'm a bit concerned it's going to be hard to wrap up well. We'll only have a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

The plot is that a wizard shows up at your village looking for adventurers to test 300 ""glitchy"" wands of magic missile and is willing to pay you 1000 gold each to do so. To tidy up the use-magic-item plothole, I'm going to be saying they're prototypes designed to be used by the magically unskilled knights of the kings army, which also explains why they're glitchy. Each of the batch has been made with slightly different techniques and they want to find the method that works best. They came out here to find patriotic citizens away from potential spies who'll do this job for the good of the realm (expendable peasants far away from anything valuable who'll ask no questions when confronted with piles of gold).

&amp;#x200B;

There's a mineshaft full of gnolls to get them started with some ready test subjects and a rough map of the region.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to add brackets to the contract so they can cash-out for a partial payment every 25 wands, but that doesn't really help with wrapping up if they don't wish to. I'm thinking maybe having the wizard find them and pay them out anyway as their boss has realised what a terrible idea testing them this way was. But I'm not 100% sold on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also thinking about dialling down the number of missiles the wands make to force them to use more wands. Or at least making it so you can only hit a single target per use. The 3-session game documented above has only used about 75 of the 300 wands in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

For prep I'm going to have a bunch of character sheets partially filled out with the commoner stats ( core rules, page 449 ) so it'll just be naming &amp; quick dice rolling. I'll have some fully made out too in case.

I'm going to have a tonne of stickynotes ready to keep track of all the status effects they're likely to accumulate (with and without realising). And I'm going to have my one-minute egg-timer ready to break out in case metagaming delays the turns. I'll also have the secret copy of the wands effects so far, not just what the players interpret the effects to be.

Hello r/Pathfinder_RPG! I'm a long time DM of 8 years as well as a year long lurker on this subreddit. I finally finished the line art for my friend's character in my 1e homebrew campaign and decided to share it here! One of my favorite parts of this project was finding ways to fit every significant piece of equipment into the aesthetic and feel of my homebrew setting of ""Ouesteleaux""(Definitely not medieval France, pronounced 'West-uh-Low'). Try to find all of these items:

Masterwork Silver Dagger +1

Mithral O-Yori +3

Ring of Protection

Amulet of Natural Armor(Look for the snail shell/tooth thing)

Belt of Physical Perfection +4

Headband of Intelligence +4

Wand of Magic Missile +3

Cloak of Resistance +3

Boots of Speed

Ring of Invisibility

&amp;#x200B;

Mozgus Lecroix was a peasant child whose parents decided to hand him over to The Order of the Blue Rose during a time of extreme poverty in the hopes that he would be able to live a better life in service to Charlemagne the Ascended King of Humanity. Mozgus, being raised by a particularly adamant member of the church became a fanatic and left monastery life to smite evil wherever he could find it. He eventually persuaded a former sergeant of the Kingdom's finest shock cavalry and youngest of a prominent noble's seven sons(Art to follow soon!) and the two became the scourge of the Midnight Aristocracy's agents. It was recently revealed that Mozgus was ""Alchemically Enhanced"" by his former mentor found in service to the Three Faced Goddess of Death and possesses Barghest eyes which allow him to see in the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

I've run 6 player campaigns, 4 player campaigns, but this last one has been my absolute favorite despite being only a 2 person campaign. The combination of vague backstories, my players' intense enjoyment of their characters both in build and personality, as well as my efforts in world building and art creation have made it a total joy ride!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/bOYVTe6""&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

More out of self interest than anything, I wanted ideas for things to add to my campaign,  but I guess the invisible hand does exist, since, a lot of people enjoyed it and found it useful xD.

Anyway, some people suggested making the thread periodically and I have been thinking about it for a while. In the end I have started thinking that maybe they way I made it was not the best. I hoped for it to be a resource for GM's and putting all types of useful stuff into one post makes it kinda chaotic and not that useful.

My idea has been, therefore, to make periodical threads by subject, sort the threads by subject in a Google Doc and have it at the end of every thread.

**I wanted to ask if you can think of any different themes than the ones I came up with and how often do you think we should have one**

Current ideas for thread topics:

-Custom Content (homebrews): magic items, custom spells, classes, races, rules...

-Interesting Encounters

-Traps

-Puzzles

-Good habits/things to do for easier play

-NPCs/shops/towns

-General world tidbits (my orcs barter)

####Appearance  

This lanky dragon’s dappled grayish scales and sprawling wings shift and fade in color, blending in with the mist.

####CR   5
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Fogburst (Su) As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 × 5 feet from the center of the fogburst’s area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as obscuring mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Fogvision (Ex) A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation.

Misty Camouflage (Ex) A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed.

Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim’s allies can regroup and come to its rescue.

Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years.

A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

I am currently a level 5 almost level 6 human unchained zen archer in a rise of the runelords campaign. Everymans unchained zen archer seems to round off at level 13 with ki focus bow, giving me at least 7 levels to play with. I am interested in a possible dip into the arcane archer prestige class. I’m thinking of doing zen archer 13/Empyreal Sorcerer 1/ Arcane archer 3/ 3 either zen archer or sorcerer. Which level would be the most appropriate time to start the arcane archer multiclassing and what order should it be done in or would it be better to just stay full zen archer? 

For Ki powers, my DM is not allowing me to take the Qinggong power (so no barkskin), so what would be the best ki powers to invests in?

Also does a Ki focus property allow my monks unarmed strike damage to apply to my bow attacks or just the abilities used with an unarmed strike (ki strike, stunning fist, etc)?

Thanks in advance for the help and advice.

Two problems, inter-related, one of which is my fault:

I'm a new GM and this is my first campaign, and I have a problem with pacing and with social rolls. There were a couple of incidents where my players rolled high for something but didn't make an argument the NPC would find convincing, so I didn't let the argument succeed, which I probably should have done anyway. My player got mad about this after I did it twice, once to him and once to another character, since I wasn't rewarding high rolls. (I talked it out with my players and we decided that I should set the DCs according to the quality of their arguments. I did warn that I would set crappy arguments very high, though, since this is a talky game and they're putting all their points in Diplomacy now. I'm thinking of putting a cap on how many points you can have in it just so it's not roll-to-win for them.) This player was just trying to brute force his way through every social interaction by banging his staff on the ground and yelling what he wanted loudly, and then rolling Intimidate, which he put a ton of ranks in. When he did that again I wanted to make it more difficult/fun for him. He tried it and rolled really well. I don't think I handled it very well, but I said the DC was very high because the player didn't understand the NPC's native language and looked poorly on outsiders. He got upset, told me he was uncomfortable with me not rewarding a high roll, and had his character quit the main quest, go to the local university, and refuse to get back to the rest of the party until his character had learned the language.

(Later he said that he thinks playing a mentally unstable character was messing him up and causing him to act out like this, so we came up with a cool way to retire the character.)

In the last session, he rolled to understand some papers a scholar NPC wrote, and I told him they make no sense at all, which is useful information and not a reflection on his character's ability to understand something, which seemed to be understood. Unfortunately, I didn't really let him react to it or try to stop the scholar's mad plans before moving on with the scene, since again I'm a new GM and I sort of have pacing problems. We're running over Discord (text-based) and I try to avoid having two minutes of everyone sitting there in silence while my players decide whether or not they want to type something. It's a delicate balance. So understand that I did make a mistake and he was already upset that session, and that I've made some bad calls on how to reward high rolls before.

But later in the session, during the final scene: he and his character expressed a repeated desire to help an NPC who was Balefully Polymorphed. The session before last I gave him a cursebreaker. The NPC insisted several times that he didn't want to be helped and to only reverse the curse if there's an emergency. I put the NPC in the game so that my players had a nuke they could set off if it looks like they were heading towards a TPK or other disaster, and the players know that. The NPC didn't want them to know that if they reversed the curse he'd likely die in a few minutes, just long enough to help them, because he thought they'd never use the cursebreaker if he did. (Probably true, he's a well-loved NPC.) Despite having a lot of warning both IC and OOC that using the cursebreaker would have unknown consequences, and that the NPC was terrified of its use, and that the party debated IC that he shouldn't do it, my player set the cursebreaker off at the end of the session anyway. (By the way, there were some hints in the game as to what would happen to the NPC if they referred back to certain events, but those happened so long ago I don't really count them.)

So after the session was over my player got angry and told me that he's not satisfied with the quality of the game the past few sessions, he wants his character to accomplish something right, and he's uncomfortable. (He did say he doesn't understand why he's uncomfortable, so he's as confused as I am right now.) 

I can see his point of view, and I should have given him an opportunity to stop the scholar, but I feel like what he did to the NPC merits the consequences. I'm not sure if he feels like I was setting him up to fail because I gave him a cursebreaker after him telling me he wanted to break the curse, and also didn't tell him what would happen if he used it, or if he should just accept the consequences of his actions since he was given ample warning both IC and OOC that the NPC would suffer if he did it.

Some more history: 

- the last character he played got tons of attention. He got to romance an NPC, solve the quest of the last arc (and arguably the arc before that too), and the death of that character after he wanted to retire him was designed to be very cool and introduce the campaign's villain. He gets more attention than any other PC and is usually the one suggesting a course of action. So it's not for a lack of participating in the plot, and he's had several incredible victories. Sometimes I sort of have to arrange things so that other characters get the spotlight, for instance, a character he says his PC has a crush on is interested in a different PC, so he won't be having a romance this arc. I don't know if his problem with the game comes from not getting to be the hero all the time.

- he does have a habit of getting uncomfortable and leaving the table, as I illustrated in the language example. A few sessions ago the group did a pretty standard ""somebody at the ball is an assassin, covertly find out who it is and stop them"" and he tried to solve it by shouting that a murder was about to take place, and an NPC quietly told him that he could ruin the target's reputation if he did that. (I was willing to let it play out his way so I wasn't railroading him, but I did want it known that this was a factor in why they asked the party to do it discreetly and there would have been consequences for the NPC.) But then he said he was uncomfortable playing out something so confrontational (he really likes using the word uncomfortable) and left the table again, I just had the guards take his character off for questioning and proceeded as usual.

All of my other players are comfortable and fine with everything I've done, and we've had open and fruitful negotiations about how to handle stuff like PvP when it comes up, or my issue with social rolls. None of them have exhibited anything close to this player's behavior, so I can't figure out where it's coming from or how to fix it. Aside from rewarding good rolls (and there've been dozens of them I've successfully rewarded and only these two or three I've really fucked up on) which we agree I need to work on.

Aside from all this I can't think of anything I've done wrong. Sorry if the post is long, I wanted to be exhaustive about it. 

Mostly, I'm concerned about the next session. The NPC is going to seriously suffer next session and possibly die. They'll have a good chance to save him and his life might otherwise be spared, but it's probably going to be legitimately uncomfortable knowing that your PC did that to a character you loved when you didn't mean to do it. I want to know what to do to keep him calm and prevent him from leaving the table in the middle of the session, especially if he rolls badly and something he tries doesn't work.

Does anybody have any idea why this player is getting repeatedly upset, what I'm doing wrong, and how to get him to relax? I can't figure out if I'm being too harsh or if he's just upset that not everything goes well for him.

But then he said he was uncomfortable playing out something so confrontational (he really likes using the word uncomfortable) and left the table again, I just had the guards take his character off for questioning and proceeded as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my other players are comfortable and fine with everything I&amp;#39;ve done, and we&amp;#39;ve had open and fruitful negotiations about how to handle stuff like PvP when it comes up, or my issue with social rolls. None of them have exhibited anything close to this player&amp;#39;s behavior, so I can&amp;#39;t figure out where it&amp;#39;s coming from or how to fix it. Aside from rewarding good rolls (and there&amp;#39;ve been dozens of them I&amp;#39;ve successfully rewarded and only these two or three I&amp;#39;ve really fucked up on) which we agree I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from all this I can&amp;#39;t think of anything I&amp;#39;ve done wrong. Sorry if the post is long, I wanted to be exhaustive about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I&amp;#39;m concerned about the next session. The NPC is going to seriously suffer next session and possibly die. They&amp;#39;ll have a good chance to save him and his life might otherwise be spared, but it&amp;#39;s probably going to be legitimately uncomfortable knowing that your PC did that to a character you loved when you didn&amp;#39;t mean to do it. I want to know what to do to keep him calm and prevent him from leaving the table in the middle of the session, especially if he rolls badly and something he tries doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have any idea why this player is getting repeatedly upset, what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong, and how to get him to relax? I can&amp;#39;t figure out if I&amp;#39;m being too harsh or if he&amp;#39;s just upset that not everything goes well for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I want some other GM's opinions on what you would do in this scenario.

Overview: I am running my first live campaign (ie not on Roll20) of the Giantslayer AP. Currently in Book 1. My 4 players are all pretty green to tabletop RPG's generally, and is the first campaign ever for 3 of them. I'm still at the stage where my players are still developing agency in looking up rules/always putting me on the spot to know what can be done when they do something unexpected. It's not bad, but I get overwhelmed by stuff like the following:

The party made the very foolish decision of splitting the party during the most significant combat portion of the book. Being the kind of GM that I am, I don't want to pull punches, so 2 members (the ranger and the cleric) of the party get backed into a burning building by 3 orcs, an encounter which they are overmatched (because the book is written that assumes the party won't split in a war zone).

The cleric, feeling she doesn't have alternative, runs out past the lead orc to get out the burning building and corner they have gotten themselves backed into. The lead orc crits on his AoO with his falchion – which mathematically should have killed the cleric (damage in excess of their CON) and, because the players agreed to subscribe to my rather lethal critical hit/fumble charts, removed her shield arm at the wrist.

It was at this point, that our session last week ended, as one player had to go catch a bus.

Now, the cleric will expend Hero Points (following RAW in their use), at the start of next session to not die/keep their hand. At this point, Paizo says it is at my discretion how I enable the cleric to cheat death.

&amp;#x200B;

There some factors that I am having difficulty weighting:

1) The players are new, including the cleric. They are still learning the rules, and have no concept of Pathfinder's metagame (ie splitting the party at such a critical time is always going to be a poor choice).

2) I made the ruling because of the split, that it will take another 2 rounds before the rest of the party catches up (the bard and fighter were dealing with a different conflict, which they actually succeeded brilliantly at).

3) I am concerned that if I let the cleric go unconscious here (with all the party's heals), as suggested by the Hero Points rules, that it will lead to a death spiral, as the players are not great at tactics and managing action economy, and are basically going to end up coming up to the orcs one at a time.

4) At the same time as all this, I want to be fair and honest, and teach them that their decisions have consequences.

5) my inclination immediately following the end of last session was to let the cleric avoid death and dismemberment, but drop them to dangerously low hitpoints, effectively using their Hero Points to make the orc fail to confirm the crit. Then say something at the time, or after the fight, about how the campaign is designed around them staying together to avoid situations like this in the future (they haven't done anything this foolhardy so far), and then be unforgiving about such errors in the future.

It has always seemed weird to me that certain skills only allow certain abilities to affect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples:
-Profession being a different ability depending on the job
-Intimidate being Cha or Str
-Heal being Int or Wis
-Craft being Int or Wis depending on which craft skill
-Survival being Int or Wis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever tried this idea, and does anyone think it would be a balance problem?&lt;/p&gt;

I am a sorcerer(Djinni bloodline) 9 in an Emerald spire campaign.

Recently, I have taken the feat Eldritch heritage(Arcane) to get a monkey familiar with the elemental(Fire) archetype.

At 11th level, I will take the improved familiar feat but I still want a fire monkey. Therefore, I have created a custom familiar based on the faery dragon's stat block. I would really like it if someone could tell me if it is balanced and witch things should I change to make it balanced.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Elemental Projectile(Ex)**

As a standard action, a scorching capuchin can instantly ignite a small object in its hands and throw it at a target within 30ft. as a ranged touch attack. Upon impact, it deals 1d6 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has and can ignite flammable objects. This ability can be used once every 1d4 rounds.

**Burning Bond (Ex)**

As a move action, a scorching capuchin can enter the skin of a willing creature that has no resistance or immunity to fire. He then transforms into a burn on the skin of that creature. When doing so, he deals 1d4 fire damage to the host creature upon entering his body. In this form, the scorching capuchin can not be targeted or attacked directly and only takes half damage when the host is damaged by an area of effect spell.  Also, he cannot take any action except to exit the host creature as a move action.

The scorching capuchin can also use this ability offensively. In this case, it takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the scorching capuchin must also succeed at a melee touch attack to enter an unwilling creature with no resistance or immunity to fire. If the scorching capuchin succeeds, he may enter the skin of the creature and deal 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has to the creature. Each round the scorching capuchin stays in the skin of the creature, the creature must make a DC 14 fortitude save. If it succeeds the scorching capuchin is expelled from it’s skin. If it does not succeed, it take 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has. The scorching capuchin may also exit the creature as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Fire-like Fur(Ex)**

The scorching capuchin’s body is covered in a special fur that has many fire-like properties. First, the fur glows as if the scorching capuchin were affected by the light spell. This effect does not work if the scorching capuchin is using his Burning Bond ability. Second, the scorching capuchin can produce heat with its fur. Anyone striking the scorching capuchin with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of fire damage.

What sort of Animals work well together/ what are the best animals for a given role or for fulfilling multiple roles? (body guard, charger, scout etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

The Campaign will likely go to at least 10th level(possibly to 20), with us reaching 5th level on the fast track and every level afterwards will be medium progression.  Party consists of a Goblin Rogue(knifemaster), a necromancer, a Barbarian, a Dragonfire Adept(3.5 class), and a Fighter(2hander).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also looking for anything i can tie to a desert theme, race or animal companion options, as the custom world our DM made has monstrous races living in a desert most of those will also do.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any help!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need help with building a level 4 Hunter. stats are kind of weird(rolled in order) 12/15/11/9/13/12 before racial. up for any 1st party race&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking either ranged or melee dex build, with Packmaster Archtype for either. What kind of feats am i looking to grab the soonest? I know Pack Flanker is important but that Int requirement is a doozy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never played a character like this before(companions) what type of things should i keep in mind for spell selection and such.&lt;/p&gt;

####Ecology  

The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.

A hippogriff’s feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff’s torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.

Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.

Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature’s wings—these saddles are always exotic saddles.

Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young—as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff’s egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load.

Is there any type of cheese/loophole/feat/spell/item that will allow some wider range of vision? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps, I will have arcane bond using eldritch heritage, maybe something with familiars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;/p&gt;

These are all class features of the two weapon warrior archetype: I was considering adding them as feats considering that the archetype is generally considered trash.  


  

Double Strike

Prerequisites improved Two weapon fighting, Bab +6

As a standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.  


Improved Balance

Improved Two weapon Fighting, bab +8

The attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by –1 for a two-weapon warrior. Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties.

  
Equal Opportunity

Improved Two Weapon fighting, Double Strike, Bab +11

when You make an attack of opportunity, you may attack once with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.

I'd appreciate any feedback and thanks for looking.  


Questions to consider:  
Does adding these as feats add to or take away from the game in general?  


What are fair prerequisites? I put in placeholders that I think are fair on the surface but I didn't put in too much thought  


And finally should it be a BaB prerequisite or a fighter level prerequisite? Would it be broken to add these to the two weapon fighting combat style for rangers?

I need your help to build a wolf Animal Companion for my next campaign. I am not that experienced with melee fighting nor combat feats, because I have always played divine spellcasters.

# Preface

&amp;#x200B;

For the next 2 years or so I will be playing a caster druid in a campaign set in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Our party will be made by a bloodrager, a witch, a u-rogue, and me, a restorer-pack lord druid focussed on spell cast. I would also like to go for the Divine Faith Acolyte prestige class, because I like it RP wise. On one side, I love to min-max characters, on the other, if I have an idea about a certain build or character that I want to play I will min-max that character, even if it is not the absolute best build.

Also, I know cats will hit harder, and other AC would be better, but I like the idea of having a wolf as AC.

# AC build

&amp;#x200B;

So, my AC is a wolf and I can’t choose between a full damage build or a trip build. I will also consider any other build you will suggest.

Full dmg build will be something like:

* Weapon focus
* Power attack
* Imp. natural attack
* Vital strike

On the other hand, my trip build would be:

* Toughness maybe
* Fill (??)
* Dirty fighting
* Improved trip
* Greater trip
* Outflank (for my rogue and bloodrager)

Basically my friends and I have felt that favored enemy being such a core feature was kind of annoying in most cases, and favored terrain seems underwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically the archetype would take away favored enemy and favored terrain in favor of being more focused on fighting styles

&amp;#x200B;

I am making it so that you can only use this archetype with the archery(ARC), two-weapon fighting (TWF), and natural attack (NA) fighting styles, as those feel the most ranger-esque and I don't want this archetype to step on fighter's toes too much.

&amp;#x200B;

The abilities are:

Level one you gain a bonus feat specifically the one that enables your fighting style

&amp;#x200B;

TWF  gains two weapon fighting

ARC gains Precise shot

NA gains Aspect of the Beast

&amp;#x200B;

At level 4 the Ranger gains the benefits of Weapon specialization when using her combat style,, this improves to greater when the Ranger reaches level 12

&amp;#x200B;

The class gains progression as per fighters weapon training  when using her combat style. they qualify for advanced weapon training abilities each time this ability improves by +1

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Notes: with this archetype ranger levels count as fighter levels for featsGenerally speaking as long as you are holding the weapon(s) these class features apply you don't have to use a full attack to make the TWF features work for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on this? Too powerful? Too much like fighter? Loses the flavor of Ranger?

Tangentially related: I am considering adding new feats to the game: Basically they are ripped from the fighter archetype, two weapon warrior although I am struggling to find fair prerequisites though and could use help:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Doublestrike

Prerequisites improved Two weapon fighting, Bab +8

As a standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.

&amp;#x200B;

Improved Balance

Improved two weapon fighting, bab +8

The attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by –1 for a two-weapon warrior. Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Equal Opportunity

Improved Two weapon fighting, Bab +11

when  You make an attack of opportunity, you may attack once with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.

Hey everyone,

For a reasonably high level PFS-campaign, my paladin is closing in on being able to cast level 4 spells. The clear best of these, at least to me, seems to be greater angelic aspect spell which to other classes is a level 8 arcane or divine spell. I cited the more relevant text of the spell below here:

&amp;#x200B;

"" This spell functions like *lesser angelic aspect*, except you gain lowlight vision; darkvision 60 feet; DR 10/evil; immunity to acid, cold, and petrification; resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10; a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison; and protective aura and truespeech as supernatural abilities for the duration of the spell. Also, your wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.

&amp;#x200B;

Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* and a ***lesser globe of invulnerability***\*\*, both with a radius of 20 feet.\*\*""

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: if an enemy tries to cast dispel magic (spell level 3) on this, what happens? Lesser globe of invulenrability reads:

&amp;#x200B;

""An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the *lesser globe of invulnerability*. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a *dispel magic* spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.""

&amp;#x200B;

So... if I understand correctly, a dispelling enemy (who only has access to basic dispel magic, not greater dispel) would have to first specifically target the protective aura surrounding the caster of greater angelic aspect, since if they don't, the dispel magic cannot reach through the aura since it is a level 3 spell (the aura functions as lesser globe of unvulnerability and blocks level 3 and below spells from ffecting those within it). But... is that possible? That would mean partially dispelling a part of the spell, in this case the aura, without affecting anything else the greater angelic aspect does, which i haven't ever seen happen otherwise (in my experience, magic is normally either fully active or fully dispelled). Is this possible or impossible, and why? Would two level 3 dispel magics be able to dispel greater angelic aspect, or do I need only one and would targetting the aura with dispel magic also remove the rest of the shapechange? Or is it outright impossible to dispel no matter how many levele 3 dispel magics are avilable?

&amp;#x200B;

Started with her following Norgerber and was a popular Bard at Taverns but would perform her duties wearing a mask and cape so as no one knew it was her. This was due to she wanted to get revenge on the parents who (she BELIEVED to have) left her, and the slave trader who kidnapped her and threw her in his lineup at the Okeno Flesh Fairs when she was 4.

Then she met her mother, even purchasing her as she was a slave and ripping the contract before her eyes. She learned the truth of what happened (a friend who was going to get her mother and her away from the debt her father acrewed, but sold both of  and betrayed them). She turned to Desna with the help of a Paladin Halfling NPC in our party (as well as Desna granting some pretty interesting dreams to her, stamping her bright blue butterfly everywhere in the dreams so Sistra knew). Still Chaotic, but leaning more to good than neutral (or even Evil if she continued on her path). 

Now, I have fully fleshed out this character. I can tell you she's been to (almost) every city in the Ketapesh region due to her travelling heart. I can tell you about someone she knows in each city. I know a great deal about the region, the laws, and what to expect in each town (My DM loves this due to a lot of it isn't in the manual as it's pretty bare bones, but it helps him flesh out the regions a bit more and give it more life and he doesn't have to study it particularly and things come across more naturally as my Bard spews info about every place she knows in efforts to come off as smart). Needless to say, I studied a lot for this character. 

But there is one thing I didn't study. Halfling culture and lore.

I played it because she got taken away from that at age 4, she wouldn't remember it. She didn't even speak halfling, only common. Due to wanting to keep the character real, I never studied it, instead studying human traits as that is who she was mainly around. But since meeting her mother, I got the green light from the DM that my Bard would learn these things from her mother. 

My question is, I can't find much. And to someone who loves to implement things that are important to her into the game and how I play her, I find this lack luster. I want to know history. I want to know heroes. I really want it all so that I have this knowledge and I can play to it. 

Is there any particular links, or maybe even fun things you have heard of about Halflings that you are willing to share? I really believe she would dive head first into any and all information she could find about halflings as it's something new and about finding who she is at the most basic of roots.

Potentially, this could be a really good feat when paired with Twin Summoner (16th level ability), but there are various wordings of several abilities that make it difficult to know how it'd react all together. 

So let's start with the basics of what we know. 

&gt;Teamwork Feats (Ex)  
&gt;  
&gt;At 4th level and at 12th level, a twinned summoner gains a bonus teamwork feat. He must meet the prerequisites of the selected teamwork feat. **The twinned summoner automatically grants all of his teamwork feats to his eidolon. The eidolon doesn’t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Allied Spellcaster  
&gt;  
&gt;**Prerequisites**: Caster level 1st.  
&gt;  
&gt;(1) Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus on level checks made to overcome spell resistance. 

Alright, so at the very least, both the Summoner and Eidolon can *have* the Allied Spellcaster feat by level 4, pre-reqs be damned, and they can both benefit from the +2 bonus to overcome SR. However, 

&gt;(2) If your ally has the same spell prepared (or known with a slot available if they are spontaneous spellcasters), this bonus increases to +4 and you receive a +1 bonus to the caster level for all level-dependent variables, such as duration, range, and effect. 

the issue starts showing when we look at Twin Summoner, and figuring out if the Summoner or Eidolon can even benefit from the feat's secondary effect. 

&gt;Twin Summoner (Su)  
&gt;  
&gt;At 16th level, a twinned summoner can touch his [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/summoner-unchained/#TOC-Eidolon) as a standard action, enhancing its similarity to the summoner. The [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/summoner-unchained/#TOC-Eidolon) loses any natural weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#TOC-Intelligence-Int-), [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-), and [Charisma ](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. **The** [**eidolon**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/summoner-unchained/#TOC-Eidolon) **can cast any of the summoner’s spells known using the summoner’s caster level and spell slots. It doesn’t gain the benefit of any of the summoner’s items, feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting.** 

So to determine if the Summoner or Eidolon can even use the secondary effect of Allied Spellcaster, we need to know if;

1. Does the Eidolon count as knowing a spell and having a spell slot available (when using Twin Summoner) for the Summoner to be able to benefit from the feat's additional effects?
2. Can the Eidolon benefit from any of the effects of Allied Spellcaster (when using Twin Summoner)?

Having just retaken Fort Ranick from the ogres (without the help of their cleric for the final fight due to him missing the session that week) they bloodied group decided the traitor wasn't so bad an was likely just influenced by magic, wanting to save him. A nap back in Turtleback Ferry felt like a good idea! So they went back, except the Kobold sorcerer who sent his goblin dog steed running off into the forest to avoid capture by the ogres. He stayed back to track down his ride and thus was delayed by about an hour. 

Since the triggering event for the flood occurs when the PC's return... The Kobold was much closer to the dam than the rest of the party, and when the damn broke and the others were busy fighting off a Hydra (an encounter they fled from on the way to Turtleback, replaced the giant snake attacking the school kids because I felt it was more dramatic!) And saving people from the temple to Erastil, the Kobold went to the dam and saw the damage...and the massive black octopus like monster speeding down from it towards the town.

 Thinking quickly, he used his two of his three real spell slots to trigger fireballs at key locations at a choke point further down, trying to make a rockslide. Given all the rain, I decided to create a mudslide instead, enough to stop the flood waters briefly and perhaps halt the monster. Not done yet, his last high level spell was used to cast fire wall, powered by an item he picked up awhile back. A mask of Nethys that can be used to cast extra spells (one lvl 5 spell, 5 lvl 1 spells, or any combination there in) or add 1d6 damage per charge used. Each charge increases chance that something goes horribly wrong (basically wild magic). He rolls to control the wild magic, gets a nat20. I describe as this massive wall, 5 times bigger than he expected bursts into life just in front of his new mud dam. Black Magga is going too fast to avoid it by now and smashes into it, reeling in pain. It only took a moment, but it was enough to make Black Magga turn away and head back...and then the Kobold failed a stealth check by 1 and black Magga sees him with one of her freakish eye tendrils. 

Thinking that this little gnat couldn't hardly be the source of her pain, she makes a single passing strike to the already somewhat injured Kobold. It hits, heavily injuring him but somehow he survived (*cough* freakishly lucky low die rolls on my end but I had terrible dice that night). For SOME REASON! the Kobold decides to follow black Magga more, and she finds him again, hitting him with her breath of madness. He fails his save and is confused for two rounds....and spent both trying to attack the closest target...black Magga.

 Round one, the Kobold closes the distance and Chuck's a dagger at it, barely notices it. Round two, the Kobold casts jump and sticks the landing and starts climbing up black Magga. Round three, black Magga is halfway back up the dam when he comes to his senses and panicked. Does the one thing can can think to do. Puts on the Gorgon mask from the first Lamia, crawls up to Black Magga's eye and tries to petrify her. Of course she made the save and continues her climb. Not before grabbing the Kobold and sending him flying away from her as she has bigger ancient monster things to do.

 I figure, this is it. The Kobold falls to his death. But nope,  manages to get off a feather fall before he hits the ground...the Kobold survives. And the best part, no one in the party is going to believe him when he gets back to tell them of his heroism.

For SOME REASON! the Kobold decides to follow black Magga more, and she finds him again, hitting him with her breath of madness. He fails his save and is confused for two rounds....and spent both trying to attack the closest target...black Magga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round one, the Kobold closes the distance and Chuck&amp;#39;s a dagger at it, barely notices it. Round two, the Kobold casts jump and sticks the landing and starts climbing up black Magga. Round three, black Magga is halfway back up the dam when he comes to his senses and panicked. Does the one thing can can think to do. Puts on the Gorgon mask from the first Lamia, crawls up to Black Magga&amp;#39;s eye and tries to petrify her. Of course she made the save and continues her climb. Not before grabbing the Kobold and sending him flying away from her as she has bigger ancient monster things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure, this is it. The Kobold falls to his death. But nope,  manages to get off a feather fall before he hits the ground...the Kobold survives. And the best part, no one in the party is going to believe him when he gets back to tell them of his heroism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a batshit session I just had to post it. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

The first 8 characters with this group were great. Sure they would argue from time to time and one player would always complain about his Druid not being a damage dealer like he wanted. Which we all told him Druids aren’t the high damage decent health role he was trying to use it for. He’d run into fights and try to frontline and just get destroyed by the enemy. So after talking to the gm about multi classing about this Druid monk thing he found online I thought the problem would be solved. Technically speaking it was solved, he now has Ki points like a monk giving him flurry of blows and all that along with all his Druid spells and can now transform into like a weretiger? He explained it as his arms changed into that of a tiger and so did his head. According to him this gave him 1 bite attack and 2 claw attacks on top of his normal attacks with flurry of blows. This was a total of 5 attacks in his one turn. That right there was a red flag for me, but the gm didn’t argue because we were in the middle of a massive boss fight and this player always argues until he wins. So 5 attacks on his turn with whatever a monks unarmed strike is I didn’t know what that was so I figured “it can’t be too much.” Well it turns out he also got the gm to modify the spell Flaming Strike for him, which as I understand is a pick a 10 foot area to make a flaming cylinder shoot up from the ground 1d6 per caster level to everything in the area. The version he had allowed him to cast it on his fists giving him 1d6 per caster level on his unarmed strikes. So at level 9 that’s 9d6 for all 5 of his attacks per turn. On average assuming I’m good at math and not including a varying AC that’s around 135 damage a turn. That’s double my health as well as the health of everyone but one character in our party which is our Paladin. She’s the only one who stands a chance of surviving his onslaught. So he does insane damage has the second most health and AC in the group and has some nice healing/buffing spells because he’s a druid and we’re only level 9. It just seems crazy to me that he’s able to dish all of that out and still be able to self sustain himself. 

It feels like he’s got all the stats of both a level 9 monk and a level 9 Druid.

The next thing I learned that worried me was our bard wants to have a massive AOE charm that works on anyone in the radius. The GM did say at level 10 we could get one ability that bends the rules so I choose being able to make potions of spells past level 3. Our bard wants an infinite AOE charm with either a really high DC, past 25, or will save involved. It just seems like the game is spiraling into a chaos of broken nonsense. I’m so close to just roleplaying myself out because I have never enjoyed games where you walk over everything like it’s nothing. I have been known to overthink things though so what are your guys thoughts on all of this?

Edit: I would say the thing that bothers me most is that boss we were fighting used on ability that knocked out everyone but this Druid monk. As the group currently stands the enemies are being made to fight him and that ends up with them mopping the floor with the rest. 

I guess it also bothers me that he went and complained long enough for it to get fixed for him. He didn’t just gain one level in this Nature’s avatar class he got all of his levels moved over into this class. Which that I admit is just petty because no one enjoys playing a character they don’t like.  To give a bit more of a preface of this player he also gets spells like stone shape formed into a combat spell. He asked to use it to form a dome over an enemy trapping them, that’s logical, but then he said I want the dome to immediately shrink and crush him to death.

So, as per the help and advice I received in [this post](https://redd.it/b3a7zh), I felt myself decently prepared for this very first session in my new campaign, in spite of a smaller-than-expected party. 

Unfortunately for me, the wizard had also backed out a day or two prior to the session, leaving me with just a warpriest and a sorcerer to play the Pathfinder Beginner Box Adventure. Both were still happy to play and so I decided to have them start at level 2. 

The session lasted for 3 hours. We had the usual session zero talk, like how we're going to play, what people are expecting and hoping to get out of it, what rules to follow, etc.

Then we played the entirety of the Adventure, with the party even shaving off over half of Black Fang's HP in the final encounter. As per the book, Black Fang flees after unleashing his breath weapon, leaving a stressed out Warpriest and an unconscious Sorcerer with the spoils of his hoard and a well-earned level up.

In spite of the drawbacks brought about by the party size, we had some good laughs, fun times, and some lucky rolls. Both guys have agreed to continue this as a bi-weekly campaign into Rise of The Rune Lords, with our first session starting a month from now. 

We are going to look into getting maybe 1 or 2 people to join the group but for now, I will be giving them one NPC companion 2 levels below, with a class of their choice, to join the party. 

I look forward to seeing how this all plays out.

####Appearance  

This squat, clawed humanoid is hunched and pink-skinned, with an oversized head. Its face is that of a fanged and insane human baby, and its mouth opens far wider than it should.

####CR   3
#####Alignment:  N
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing lava child can pass through stone, dirt, metal, lava, or almost any other sort of earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lava child flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) A lava child is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and has the earth descriptor.

Magma Throwing (Su) A lava child can cough up a ball of magma into its hand as a move action. It remains hot as long as the lava child holds it, but cools to the ambient temperature 1 round after it is released. A lava child can throw a magma ball as if it were a flask of alchemist’s fire, or add its damage to one successful claw attack. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice. On any round in which the lava child remains partially immersed in molten stone and does not leave it, it may scoop up a handful as a move action and then throw it as if using this ability, but that action does not count toward its daily limit.

Metal Immunity (Su) Lava children ignore the presence of metal and are able to pass through it as easily as air. They are immune to metal weapons, and their attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal armor and shields.

Vulnerability to Cold and Water (Ex) Spells and effects with the water or cold subtype inflict +50% damage against lava children (though these vulnerabilities do not stack—effects that are both cold and water still deal only an additional +50% damage). Splashing a lava child with at least 1 gallon of water inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Immersion in water causes lava children to take 2d6 points of damage per round and affects them as a slow spell while they remain submerged.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Lava children are ill-tempered creatures created by shaitan genies. Shaped like stunted humanoids with the hideous heads of fanged infants, they prefer to reside in volcanoes. Typical lava children are 5 feet tall and 450 pounds.
Variants
Because of their strange means of reproduction, lava children have branched out over the generations into a number of distinct variations. Below are some of the most common.

Chieftains (+1 CR): The most important of all lava children variants are the chieftains, those exceptional lava children who employ magic and rhetoric to inspire or browbeat their cystmates into obedience. Lava children chieftains are visually indistinguishable from ordinary lava children, but often bear several innate magical abilities passed down from parent to offspring in what the chieftains (sometimes referred to as priests, though not necessarily affiliated with a deity) claim are a physical manifestation of their right to lead. Divine right or otherwise, lava children chieftains are most likely to lead from the rear, using their lava channel ability to heal lava children and other elemental creatures commanded into their service, while simultaneously unleashing their spell-like abilities to defend their cysts or make war upon those who fail to show proper deference. For reasons not entirely understood, lava children chieftains are much longer-lived than ordinary lava children, with a lifespan similar to that of dwarves. Lava children chieftains have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294) and the following abilities:

Spell-Like Abilities (CL 5th; concentration +7):
At will—faerie fire
3/day—pyrotechnics (DC 15), stone shape
1/day—contact other plane (earth or fire elemental plane only), summon nature's ally III (creatures with earth or fire subtype only)

Lava Channel (Su): Three times per day, a lava child chieftain can channel volcanic energy to produce an explosion of molten rock, which functions like the channel positive energy ability of a cleric, except that it heals 3d6 points of damage for creatures with the earth or fire subtypes and does 3d6 points of fire damage to all others.

Lava Form (Su): A lava child chieftain can shift between its solid body and one made of molten rock as a standard action. In lava form, the chieftain gains the elemental subtype, and its claw attacks add +1d6 fire damage. Any creature grappling or striking the lava form with natural weapons or natural attacks takes 1d6 points of fire damage. It can remain in this form for up to 5 minutes per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

Behemoth (+1 CR): This rare caste of warrior lava children was designed by its creators for espionage missions into especially dangerous regions. Though most behemoths succumbed to the high mortality rate that came with following their creators’ orders, a few managed to survive and breed. Lava children behemoths have the giant creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295) and Improved Bull Rush as a bonus feat. They gain the following special attack.

Tremor (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a lava child behemoth can slam its fists to the ground to create an earth tremor. The behemoth makes a trip attempt against all adjacent creatures. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity and the behemoth is not at risk of being knocked prone. Multiple behemoths can cooperate to affect a larger area; as long as each behemoth uses this ability at the same time and is adjacent to at least one other behemoth using this ability, the affected area increases by 5 feet in all directions.

Youths and Ancients (–1 CR): While mature lava children are Medium-sized, they are smaller at both the beginning and the end oflife. Newborn lava children are already the size of halflings, and grow quickly to full size within 6 years. At the opposite end oflife, the venerable lava children past 70 years of age lose their strength and mass as their bodies slowly wither. Both youths and ancients use the young creature simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295); the latter also apply venerable age modifiers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169).

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lava%20Child""&gt;Lava Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Appearance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This squat, clawed humanoid is hunched and pink-skinned, with an oversized head. Its face is that of a fanged and insane human baby, and its mouth opens far wider than it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;CR   3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Alignment:  N&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Size:   Medium&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Special Abilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing lava child can pass through stone, dirt, metal, lava, or almost any other sort of earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lava child flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) A lava child is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and has the earth descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magma Throwing (Su) A lava child can cough up a ball of magma into its hand as a move action. It remains hot as long as the lava child holds it, but cools to the ambient temperature 1 round after it is released. A lava child can throw a magma ball as if it were a flask of alchemist’s fire, or add its damage to one successful claw attack. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice. On any round in which the lava child remains partially immersed in molten stone and does not leave it, it may scoop up a handful as a move action and then throw it as if using this ability, but that action does not count toward its daily limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metal Immunity (Su) Lava children ignore the presence of metal and are able to pass through it as easily as air. They are immune to metal weapons, and their attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal armor and shields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability to Cold and Water (Ex) Spells and effects with the water or cold subtype inflict +50% damage against lava children (though these vulnerabilities do not stack—effects that are both cold and water still deal only an additional +50% damage). Splashing a lava child with at least 1 gallon of water inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Immersion in water causes lava children to take 2d6 points of damage per round and affects them as a slow spell while they remain submerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ecology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava children are ill-tempered creatures created by shaitan genies. Shaped like stunted humanoids with the hideous heads of fanged infants, they prefer to reside in volcanoes. Typical lava children are 5 feet tall and 450 pounds.
Variants
Because of their strange means of reproduction, lava children have branched out over the generations into a number of distinct variations. Below are some of the most common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chieftains (+1 CR): The most important of all lava children variants are the chieftains, those exceptional lava children who employ magic and rhetoric to inspire or browbeat their cystmates into obedience. Lava children chieftains are visually indistinguishable from ordinary lava children, but often bear several innate magical abilities passed down from parent to offspring in what the chieftains (sometimes referred to as priests, though not necessarily affiliated with a deity) claim are a physical manifestation of their right to lead. Divine right or otherwise, lava children chieftains are most likely to lead from the rear, using their lava channel ability to heal lava children and other elemental creatures commanded into their service, while simultaneously unleashing their spell-like abilities to defend their cysts or make war upon those who fail to show proper deference. For reasons not entirely understood, lava children chieftains are much longer-lived than ordinary lava children, with a lifespan similar to that of dwarves. Lava children chieftains have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294) and the following abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spell-Like Abilities (CL 5th; concentration +7):
At will—faerie fire
3/day—pyrotechnics (DC 15), stone shape
1/day—contact other plane (earth or fire elemental plane only), summon nature&amp;#39;s ally III (creatures with earth or fire subtype only)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava Channel (Su): Three times per day, a lava child chieftain can channel volcanic energy to produce an explosion of molten rock, which functions like the channel positive energy ability of a cleric, except that it heals 3d6 points of damage for creatures with the earth or fire subtypes and does 3d6 points of fire damage to all others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava Form (Su): A lava child chieftain can shift between its solid body and one made of molten rock as a standard action. In lava form, the chieftain gains the elemental subtype, and its claw attacks add +1d6 fire damage. Any creature grappling or striking the lava form with natural weapons or natural attacks takes 1d6 points of fire damage. It can remain in this form for up to 5 minutes per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behemoth (+1 CR): This rare caste of warrior lava children was designed by its creators for espionage missions into especially dangerous regions. Though most behemoths succumbed to the high mortality rate that came with following their creators’ orders, a few managed to survive and breed. Lava children behemoths have the giant creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295) and Improved Bull Rush as a bonus feat. They gain the following special attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tremor (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a lava child behemoth can slam its fists to the ground to create an earth tremor. The behemoth makes a trip attempt against all adjacent creatures. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity and the behemoth is not at risk of being knocked prone. Multiple behemoths can cooperate to affect a larger area; as long as each behemoth uses this ability at the same time and is adjacent to at least one other behemoth using this ability, the affected area increases by 5 feet in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youths and Ancients (–1 CR): While mature lava children are Medium-sized, they are smaller at both the beginning and the end oflife. Newborn lava children are already the size of halflings, and grow quickly to full size within 6 years. At the opposite end oflife, the venerable lava children past 70 years of age lose their strength and mass as their bodies slowly wither. Both youths and ancients use the young creature simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295); the latter also apply venerable age modifiers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169).&lt;/p&gt;

I've been brainstorming an idea in my head for a character for an up coming adventure path. I want to make sure I have it all thought out before bringing it up to my DM. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I want to create an arcane spell caster like a wizard or sorcerer. The back story would be that his familiar and him permanently switched bodies, either by a curse or spell.

It would be amazing if I could pull it off without the other characters in the party realizing what was going on at first. 

I'm not sure mechanically the best way to go about this. I'm sure i would need feats for spell casting without words or gestures right?

Thanks for the help!

&lt;li&gt;Tiefling Wizard &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Disclaimer, some are admittedly D&amp;amp;D characters but, they still count&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never played a healer but apart from that, I can make a pretty balanced party &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets for the sake of sanity, say, a maximum party size of 6 because that is not unreasonable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing what you have got&lt;/p&gt;

So I just finished Love, Death and Robots and was in awe of all the shorts. Mostly Sonnie's Edge, and the Beasties. (If you haven't see it yet its on netfilx and its really cool) 

I have a campaign starting in 2 weeks and thought how cool would it be to play as the  **Khanivore.**

I asked a few friends and they suggested Synth Summoner. I know all about how OP they are, but I have no intention of MinMaxing. I like flavor and design over raw math. I keep trying to make this work but have no idea what to do. Looking for suggestion and abstract ideas mainly.

The campaign I'll be starting soon will be a little bit particular, so before answering read on the special rules we have.

The GM is trying a concept for a custom campaign based on MMOs. We're 6 players, and a GM. We can have several characters and they all start at lvl 1 with 20 BP, always. We can switch characters, and they're basically all ""us"", so offer very little roleplay value. This means... the world will be ruthless. The main point probably is that the GM won't have to hold back on his builds, making his characters weaker and whatnot, and won't have to feel bad when he (accidentally or not) kills our character.

Abuses like logging on to a character with buffs, using Mage Armor on everyone, then logging on to the other character are forbidden, obviously lol. Crafting is also highly nerfed (so a lvl 3 crafter can't just do everything). We need to have the item's CL to be able to craft it (this means that we need to be Caster Level 8 for any sort of Headband, for example). If I want a crafter, I need it to be able to get to high level. This is so most of our interesting items come from monster loot, which the GM plans to make pretty good. (A lot of other rules are also in place, mostly just banning the most broken things in Pathfinder like races that are too powerful, Leadership feats and whatnot)

If a character dies... he's dead (that's the choice we made as players, we were offered the choice to be able to ressurect them but we refused, for challenge). This means we start over with another character at lvl 1 (or switch to another character we previously trained, we can log on any one at any time so we can level up several ones). But we can get powerleveled by higher-level characters. Experience is flat, and I think we get bonus xp if we're with a higher-level party or something (to be able to get back on track quicker), although we will have level disparities. Items can be transfered from one character to the other btw, and it automatically happens if we die.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 2 concepts for characters : my main one would be a Scythe-wielding Warpriest. Unfortunately, Leadership feats and most broken things are forbidden, so I can't just give crits to myself with a Dual-Kukri Squire with Butterfly Sting or whatever. But I still want the flavor of a Scythe badass of Urgathoa as a 'main' character, eventually getting a Void Scythe (crafted at lvl 13 ;-;). But before making that, I might want to create a Craftsman.

I have looked around on the Internet (Forgemaster Dwarf, craft Wizard, craft Alchemist, etc.) but can't seem to decide. I have never played a Wizard, but most people seem to say that Wizard is the best at crafting. Thing is, that 1d6 per hit dice is scary, and by experience, I know that every intelligent creature goes for the Wizard or caster first. I mean, don't we all? They're the squishiest and most dangerous, most of the time. Since the world is going to be pretty dangerous, I feel like I would die before I even get Craft Wondrous Items or anything lol Also I have 0 experience as a Mage and have no idea what direction to take. My brain is already overheating by all the information I looked around for my Warpriest. My first concept was to make the Warpriest the crafter anyway, but that would require me to be Human instead of an Oni-Spawn Tiefling, lose stats, etc. And since we can have several characters, that might not be the most interesting thing to do.

Anyway, what's your opinion on this? Do you guys have any good character concepts? Also if you have anything else than a craftsman to propose, I'm open for it too. Some way to take advantage of this multi-character thing. The only thing to remember is that I can expect the GM to kill any of us at any time lol (not with bullshit, just with well-built enemies).

I thus inquire your help!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT : A few more details that I will add when I think of it or when I see responses:

\- Only Paizo classes authorized (maybe I can negociate but not sure).

So  in the current campaign I am playing in I an running a Metal Wizard  that builds all sorts of Robots, and the campaign just went Mythic (We  are fighting Eldritch Abominations/Elder gods, while rebuilding a lost  civilization.)

We are currently level 8  and mythic tier 2, and I am running out of ideas for feats, and I am  running out of ideas for spells to look out for, feats to pick on our  journey (including mythic feats), and magical items that can assist me  (Dm is allowing me to make custom items! So if you guys have homebrewed  items I can bring them up to him to research and create). I managed to  pick up Display of Intelligence + Crafting Mastery, and my int is  already high.

So I can easily get up to  +60 to any craft. I might continue to take some things that boost my  craft because I'm not sure how high some of the ancient constructs dc  requirements will be. (Just picked up an artifact that contains up to  10th level magic for constructs).

Right!

The sources I've found that mention the reasoning behind switching CMW out for Stabilize say something to the effect that unlimited healing is OP. From where I'm sitting, I can't for the life of me see why.

I'm assuming combat healing is probably not the problem, since one HP for a standard action at touch range is miniscule.

So, why, exactly, is out-of-combat healing at a rate of 100 HP per ten minutes spent bustling around praying over the wounded actually a problem for the game?

&lt;p&gt;The sources I&amp;#39;ve found that mention the reasoning behind switching CMW out for Stabilize say something to the effect that unlimited healing is OP. From where I&amp;#39;m sitting, I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me see why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m assuming combat healing is probably not the problem, since one HP for a standard action at touch range is miniscule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why, exactly, is out-of-combat healing at a rate of 100 HP per ten minutes spent bustling around praying over the wounded actually a problem for the game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: the answer is that it would turn Golarion into a superhero setting. Thanks to &lt;a href=""/u/energyscholar""&gt;/u/energyscholar&lt;/a&gt; for pointing that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Electric Boogaloo: And now &lt;a href=""/u/Tels315""&gt;/u/Tels315&lt;/a&gt; says I was right in the first place. Gee, it&amp;#39;s almost like TTRPG game design is complicated and the thread flair I chose was ridiculously optimistic. -_-&lt;/p&gt;

For anyone unfamiliar with the character, when she is in a stressful situation or when she is embarrassed or afraid, she becomes heated and can actually make things catch fire with a touch or in a couple situations, she’s vomited lava. 

Note: This is not meant to copy the character’s ability but is only inspired by them. 

The curse

Super Heated

In times of great stress, your body heats to the point of burning all that you touch. 

Whenever you are the subject of an attack, wether or not it hits, you gain the shaken condition for one round. So long as you are shaken, you may make a touch attack that deals 1d4+cha fire damage. (Consecutive hits don’t worsen it but other fear effects can)

Level 5: treat fear effects as one step less severe (to a minimum of shaken)

Level 10: resistance 10 fire 

Level 15: immune to frightened condition and resist 20 fire

What do you all think? Any input?

I'm trying to be GM for the first time and I was wondering how to adjust the levels of my campain's NPCs to match the group's level.

We're talking about a 5 man party of lv 3.

I've played enough to know that a lv 15 NPC&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 lvl 3 but still. I was wondering if you guys had some quick way to figure this out. I'm not asking for an absolute answer, I guess it's not that defined but if you have any tips to guide me, it'll be great.

I don't want to ruin the fun and wipe the entire party in a couple rounds but I'd like to get an aproximation in lvls if possible so I can play around this a bit.

i.e. optimal level being X,

X-1 or 2=&gt; easy encounter

X+1 or 2=&gt; medium hard

X+ 3 or 4=&gt; tough one etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Calistria the goddess of many faces and guises, including lust. Reading the ancient tomes and scrolls about her, you will find numerous stories of her trysts; for she is seen as a desirable partner by both divine beings and mortals alike. Her trysts are well documented and often near legendary, though conflicting sources result in difficulty should one attempt to discern those tales based in truth from those that are nothing more than fantasy. Many mortals have attempted and failed to woo the Savored Sting, the tale of Cayden Cailean's claims that his rise to divinity was the result of a failed attempt to win the attention of the Unquenchable Fire. One other tale tells of the one who wooed her, the Mountain Chieftain Urtar Argus. Their brief union resulted in an offspring that would drive them apart.    
&gt;  
&gt;Calistria hid her child away, hoping he would never find him, and for that Darvan Seckor was left to fend for himself in the slums of Riddleport from such a tender age. It wasn't long before he found sanctuary and a family with the criminal enterprises that plied their trade there.    
&gt;  
&gt;Even with his young age he had a natural talent, one that the local thieves guild exploited. A man by the name of Vachedi Kjell took him under his wing, taught him everything he knew, and introduced him to his deity; Calistria.    
&gt;  
&gt;The unscrupulous lot that surrounded him, almost respected him but, certainly admired him for his gusto in a bar fight. Despite the company he kept he never lost the goodness inside him but, being forced to break his moral code just to survive, tore him up.    
&gt;  
&gt;He strived to find away out, a way to escape this life that would certainly kill him, if not, damn him for eternity.    
&gt;  
&gt;It wasn’t long though before his actions caught his mothers attention. She appeared to him as a hallucinogenic vision caused from a wasp sting to the back of the neck, and in this vision she promised him what he desired, that she could be the family he never truly had.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the offer, the only thing he had to do was one last terrible act, and he would be free. To betray his family in hope for a better one. When the time came, Calistria awoke that ancient primal energy, releasing untold power into his veins, his eyes bursting into green flame, and runes circle forming around his wrists and upper forearm, the product of centuries weaved together; the manifestation of destiny had begun.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it was all said and done, the guilds headquarters was on fire, and Darvan slipped into the night grasping Vachedi Kjell’s lucky signet ring in his hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;After many years, and a lot of miles travelled he now stands just under 6' tall and 180lbs or so, dressed in grey and black robes, and with a grey headscarf wrapped around his head, and covering his face. Pulling the scarf down past the mouth reveals well kept brown facial hair, and emerald green eyes. To accessorise his modest dress he wears a pendant dedicated to Calistria around his neck, and has festooned his birthmark riddled hands with silver signet rings. The birthmarks closely make out the symbol to the evocation school of magic, and seem to almost emanate an energy of their own. Slung over his shoulders is an old battered scroll holder, and by standing in close proximity you catch a whiff of almond coming off of him, almost as something has turned acidic.

Protection from Arrows's duration is either 1 hr per level or until 10 points of damage is negated.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is does the bloodrage power last while raging until:

1. ignoring the ""time"" portion, the effect will still expire when 10 points of damage is negated; or
2. it ignores both the time portion and the damage negation portion, so you have 10/magic vs ranged for the entirety of the bloodrage.

&amp;#x200B;

RAW makes me think #2 is correct, since both the time and damage portions are part of that spells ""duration"" which Arcane BR ignores.

Edit: 

*Enforcer:*

Benefit: Whenever you deal nonlethal damage with a melee weapon, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize your target as a free action. If you are successful, the target is shaken for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt. If your attack was a critical hit, your target is frightened for 1 round with a successful Intimidate check, as well as being shaken for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt.

*rime spell:*

Benefit: The frost of your cold spell clings to the target, impeding it for a short time. A rime spell causes creatures that takes cold damage from the spell to become entangled for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell.

This feat only affects spells with the cold descriptor.

Level Increase: +1 (a rime spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.)

*frostbite:*

School transmutation [cold]; Level bloodrager 1, druid 1, magus 1, shaman 1, witch 1

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

EFFECT

Range touch
Targets creature touched
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes

DESCRIPTION

Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1 point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target recovers from the nonlethal damage. This spell cannot make a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

*whip:*

Cost 1 gp Weight 2 lbs.
Damage 1d2 (small), 1d3 (medium) Critical x2 Type slashing
Category one-handed Proficiency exotic
Weapon Group flails
Special disarm, nonlethal, reach, trip

A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon. Wielding a whip in two hands does not add 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage rolls as with other weapons (UE update).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My build is currently a mysterious stranger swashbucklet 1/haxcrafter magus 4.

1. The Cheliax is sort of like Britain and East coast USA, keen on absorbing Varisia.
2. Veldraine is already basically a Chelish colony. Curse of the Crimson Throne will involve a Chelish plot to annex Korvosa centrally.
3. Instead of Hellknights, we've got Hellmarshalls - the long arm of the law, these duster-clad crusaders roam Varisia hunting outlaws and dispensing frontier justice. 
4. Instead of the Sable Company, we've got the Sable Cavalry: eloquent, prestigious, and aloof, these mounted aristocrats serve the Queen of Korvosa directly.
5. Each town has a sheriff and a deputy instead of a town guard. If need be, the sheriff will deputise townsfolk. Bigger towns have a militia.
6. The Shoanti can basically just be themselves. Varisians are more Mexican.
7. Kaer Maga is a bit like a lawless Mexican frontier town, well beyond the reach of the Hellmarshalls and the Sable Cavalry.

To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell’s effects take place, she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell’s level). If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its effects are replaced by a wild magic effect with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered until the end of her next turn.

What really stands out for me, though, is the fact that Progenitors can use Wild Shape to take the form of various Fey. However, I am uncertain how useful this would be beyond some fantastic faerie type flavor (something I can totally get behind just from flavor alone).

Also, being small makes it easier to find cover and concealment. But, I figured people would not take my charismatic, semi-criminal, social butterfly as seriously if he were a smaller race.

My question is, are there any cool magic items/feats/rogue talents/traits/racial traits that will allow my character to make them self small (at least temporarily).

1. Ways to supplement my stealth other than being small. I know there are plenty of ways to boost your stealth score other than size
2. Excuses for why I won't actually need as high a stealth score as I think. 
3. Class suggestions other than rogue. 
4. Spells that the party could cast on me.
5. Single time/consumable items. IE: potion of reduce person.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been a member of this sub for a long time now (about 3 years) and everyone here has helped me out so much, I feel completely in debt. So, not long ago I finished a code I had been working on for a while now, it is based on the  diagrammatic cipher but, since I am a crazy gm, I had gone over the top to complicate it.

Here is the link to the google drive where you can find every letter, together with the image to decipher it. Let me know what you think, I hope at least someone has a use for this XD.

PS: if you do not understand it, just think about it only looking at the color of the dot, ie black dot represents the right side and white dot represents the left side.

PSS: If anyone is interested on why the fuck I made this, short answer is mad wizard, ill share the long answer if people are interested.

PSSS: I didnt know what to flair this so.... I guess game craft will do XD

The real killer was the the fact you'd receive something new every 5 levels which meant that realistically you'd get something *hopefully* cool mostly 2 or rarely 3 times in one game over a long span of time.

So I made my own skill unlocks (though they are very much still work in progress and some of the abilities are more placeholder than anything). Furthermore, I made skill unlocks receive new abilities every 4 levels instead of 5 (so at 4,8,12,16,20) with this change I deemed fit to change the requirement for the Signature Skill feat to only 4 Ranks in the skill and I also made the unchained rogue receive a skill unlock every 4 levels instead.

 \-Some Context - I run pretty anti min-max games so I personally don't mind if some of the skill unlocks are *slightly too good for a feat* , within reason of course. Any feedback about what some of the skill unlocks could also give feature wise or balancing changes would be much appreciated (I will have to say I ran out of ideas at times).  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that Skill Unlocks weren&amp;#39;t very appealing to me - some of them were rather boring or just not designed for rogues or any specific non-niche characters. The real killer was the the fact you&amp;#39;d receive something new every 5 levels which meant that realistically you&amp;#39;d get something &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; cool mostly 2 or rarely 3 times in one game over a long span of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I made my own skill unlocks (though they are very much still work in progress and some of the abilities are more placeholder than anything). Furthermore, I made skill unlocks receive new abilities every 4 levels instead of 5 (so at 4,8,12,16,20) with this change I deemed fit to change the requirement for the Signature Skill feat to only 4 Ranks in the skill and I also made the unchained rogue receive a skill unlock every 4 levels instead.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the current progress: &lt;/p&gt;

So I thought I'd ask this question here since a friend of mine told me about a campaign snag he hit last week.

&amp;#x200B;

His party are all followers of Iomedae and more specifically are a part of a cult that honors the Hand of the Inheritor in their crusade to promote just rulers and remove the land of evil influences.  The party has a pair of paladins within it, who are identical twins and by identical, I mean identical.  I got to look at their stat sheets and with the exception of one taking toughness so that his HP-pool could match his brother's they are stat for stat, the same.  (Teamwork feats by the way.)

Both paladins were raised in the cult with the party born only three minutes apart from each other and have never left each others sides for longer than a week or two at a time.  They've just turned twenty-seven and have been on several successful adventures leading the cult to recognize their talents. A higher position within the cult opened and both paladins were nominated to it. Since they were identical, the cult asked if they would prefer to stand at a trial to prove who was more worthy and the paladins agreed.  They were given the option of debate or an honorable duel.  The players choose the duel.  


Here is the sticking part, both players retired the evening before and prayed to Iomedae for guidance and blessing in the following conflict so that neither would be harmed but that they'd best serve their god.  Both proceeded to roll natural 20s on their supplication.  The DM has said unless a better idea comes up, he's just going to say their prayers cancelled each other out and they are both suited for the position so whoever wins, wins.

My party is level 3 right now and they will get a chance to get this item around level 7 (depending on which milestones they get). The party does not have a caster that can resurrect, but I would like to give them the opportunity to save their characters from death.

The item is a +2 Dagger that absorbs the life force of creatures that it slays and can resurrect people with that life force. The players won't know how the item works exactly until they do extensive research into it or find someone who does know the item. The only thing they would know is that it can resurrect people by plunging the knife into the heart of a dead person and that it uses the life force of slain enemies to do so.

**Absorbing Knife** (actual name will be different, but I don't want my players to find it)

This +2 Ademantine dagger absorbs the life force of creatures it slays. It gets one stack for every HD off a creature it deals the killing blow to. Using this knife to kill innocent creatures will result in an alignment shift towards evil, subject to the DM.

The life force stored in the knife can be used to resurrect people and creatures as follows:
The creature to be resurrected has to be stabbed in the heart while the knife holds enough stacks, within one day of its death. This has the following effects:

- The creature is marked by the (homebrewed) God of Death: A black mark forms around the heart. If a creature is resurrected multiple times, this mark grows larger.
- The creature is resurrected as per the following spell, according to the amount of stacks in the knife and its level or HD:

Reincarnate: 1x stacks per level/HD

Reincarnate (only one negative level): 2x stacks per level/HD

Raise Dead: 3x stacks per level/HD

Raise Dead (only one negative level): 4x stacks per level/HD

Resurrection: 5x stacks per level/HD

- The knife loses all its leftover stacks.

I would like some help with the amount of stacks needed to resurrect someone. If I would choose it myself I think I would use 5 for x for the stacks needed (eg: to Reincarnate a level 8 character the knife would have to hold 1\*5\*8 = 40 stacks, to Resurrect the same character, the knife would have to hold 5\*5\*8 = 200 stacks). However, I have no idea if that is too hard or too easy. To me the Reincarnate would be fine with that option, but Resurrect might be too hard to reach (although that might not matter).

Keep in mind that the players have to take risks (use a dagger to deal the finishing blow instead of a better weapon or keeping an enemy alive for a little longer to finish him off with the dagger) to get stacks. They would also have no exact idea how much stacks the knife holds, unless they roll a high enough knowledge check for the creature they killed with the knife, although I would give them a range the HD falls in if their knowledge isn't high enough.


Obviously, the loss of the material components of the spells makes it pretty powerful as well, so I want to make it hard to reach the needed amount of stacks, but it still has to be attainable. Another way to fix this would be to require a ritual that consumes a certain amount of material components, just like the spells, but I am still on the fence about what to do.

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated! I struggle the most with the amount of stacks needed, but any help with wording or flavour would also be great!&lt;/p&gt;

Since our party has only 3 members, we have more gold than expected, so I  want to either chose some nice magic items or save money for them.

I'm playing a Summoner (Morphic Savant/Godcaller) that is a fervorous follower of Desna, calling critters ""from the dreamlands"" (aka summoned monsters with tons of evolutions and templates) to help and support my party. Summoner-specific items are rare and rod of giant summoning is (rightfully) banned, but my GM agreed to give me custom items if they fit the theme.

Based on that, I've come up with a few suggestions - some that I could acquire right now, others that could be on my 'roadmap' - and I'd love to know how balanced/well priced they seem.

* **Rod of Starsung Summons (Lesser)**

  * Price: 3000~4000 GP (based on other Lesser rods)

  * Description: This delicate iron rod has an intricate pattern of constellations all over its surface and a moth-shaped handle in the middle. One end is marked by an eight-pointed star, while the other one displays a waning moon

  * Effect: The wielder can use the rod up to **three times per day** to augment her casting of a conjuration(summoning) spell or spell-like ability. Doing so grants her summons the same effects of having either **[Moonlight Summons](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Moonlight%20Summons) or [Starlight Summons](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Starlight%20Summons)** (chosen when the spell is cast). The same effect applies to all summoned creatures. Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower.

  * Comments: a thematic item that fits VERY well with my character, enhancing summons with Desna's characteristics - the enhancements are situational at best, though, so it's more of an utility/style item that will only be useful on a few (key) encounters, I believe.

* **Scepter of the Dreamcaller** (version 1)

  * Price: 15k~20k

  * Description: the same as a [**Suzerain Scepter**](https://aonprd.com/MagicRodsDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Suzerain%20Scepter), swapping Knowledge(nobility) for Knowledge(planes), removing the Leadership bonus and limiting the morale bonus to summoned creatures.

  * Comments: a little bit too expensive for now, and paying 5k for two +5s feels suboptimal when 20k is already over my total budget. The concept of buffing minions is very cool and it could combo well with the correct buil though. Finally, my summons are already VERY effective on attacking, so I'm not sure whether this bonus will be useful nor healthy for the campaign.

* **Scepter of the Dreamcaller** (version 2)

  * Price: 7k~9k GP

  * Description: this pearlescent marble scepter is topped by a blue gemstone cut as an eight-pointed star.

  * Effect: A Scepter of the Dreamcaller radiates a continuous [Bless](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bless) effect that affects any creature summoned or called by the wielder. Further more, it can be used once per day to cast [Beacon of Luck](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Beacon%20of%20Luck) for up to 5 minutes.

  * Comments: now that's more like it! A small but nice buff to summoned creatures and a defensive/supportive effect for emergencies - using a Desnan spell no less. Perhaps the effect Beacon of Luck could automatically affect the summons, but not the caster nor its allies (would this be stronger or weaker?).

* **Dreamcatcher of unsung fates**

  * Price: 5400 GP

  * Description: this dreamcatcher, made from elk antlers and a silvery thread, is adorned with an arrangement of dark and brightly colored feathers. The shape defined by its threads seem to change from time to time, but the resulting patterns are hardly discernible.

  * Effect: **By sleeping under a Dreamcatcher** of Unsung Fates for 8h without interruptions, one can tap into the Dreamlands and glimpse alternate versions on herself. When the sleeper wakes up she can **choose any one feat for which she meets the prerequisites**. Then, during the next 24 hours (or before the next time she sleeps, whichever happens before) she can, as a standard action, **be treated as if she possessed the chosen feat for up to five minutes** as long as she wears the dreamcatcher. If the chosen feat allows especific choices (such as a spell learned from Expanded Arcana), the Dreamcatcher will always grant the same choice unless the user refrains from sleeping under it for 48h.

  * Comments: ok, I know [Paragon Surge](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paragon%20Surge) is full of dirty shenanigans, but I don't want any of that. Instead, the idea here is just to grant some flexibility from dreams. It doesn't grant Paragon Surge's attribute bonuses either, but the effect is similar so I used it as a price reference. With a limited time usage per day, it would be mostly used for things such as grabbing an skill unlock or an interesting, albeit situational out-of-combat feat that you could have taken anyway.

What happens when I cast Gravity Bow? (which essentially bumps the damage dice up)

Does the 1d8 become 2d6? What about the additional 2d6 from sworn enemy? Does that also bump to 3d6?

If they both bump, this is crazy. Swearing an oath adds an additional +3 to hit and then does 5d6+7 damage? Jeez. It's like shooting a a tree trunk out of the bow.

&lt;p&gt;So far so good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when I cast Gravity Bow? (which essentially bumps the damage dice up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the 1d8 become 2d6? What about the additional 2d6 from sworn enemy? Does that also bump to 3d6?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they both bump, this is crazy. Swearing an oath adds an additional +3 to hit and then does 5d6+7 damage? Jeez. It&amp;#39;s like shooting a a tree trunk out of the bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I think the Sworn Enemy increases the attack and damage bonus up 3 (from +2 to +5). Right? &lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance  

This dry, hovering corpse’s chest is a prison of jagged ribs, within which is trapped a small tormented ghostly form.

####CR   11
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

**Devour Soul** (Su)

 By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer’s chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer’s destruction (or a spell deflection—see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell’s level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained—these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell Deflection** (Su)

 If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected—success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.

Devourers are the undead remnants of fiends and evil spellcasters who became lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse. Returning with warped bodies, alien sentience, and a hunger for life, devourers threaten all souls with a terrifying, tormented annihilation. These withered corpses stand 10 feet tall but weigh a mere 200 pounds.

Devourers’ origins are shrouded in mystery. While spellcasters may create them through the usage of create greater undead spells, exactly what occurs during these rituals is unclear, and it’s possible that devourers are more called into being than physically created—certainly it’s more than just a simple matter of animating a corpse.

Unlike many other forms of undead, devourers do not form spontaneously, nor do they breed or spawn. Rather, they begin as either one of two creatures: a terribly evil mortal spellcaster or an actual fiend. Those of either category who find themselves lost in the hinterlands of the cosmos sometimes return as devourers, their forms stretched and twisted into almost unrecognizable 10-foot-tall behemoths. They do not find their rebirth, their unholy transfiguration, in a specific place or plane. Rather, far beyond the knowledge and sight of mortals or outsiders, they experience some sort of transformative gnosis, realizing some infectious idea that simultaneously destroys and recreates them with a new form and a new hunger. Whether or not there might be something out there that actively calls to them, compulsively drawing them to its presence and making them into what they are, is anyone’s guess, yet it would explain why only evil outsiders and spellcasters seem to be susceptible, and also potentially why the strange mannerisms of the devourers who return to the planes seem more than simple madness. It’s even possible that some devourers themselves might not be aware of their precise origins, and their obsessions could be attempts to find their way back and discover who or what made them.

Those devourers created (or potentially called from elsewhere) by magic share all the traits and madness of their transformed kin, a fact that has confused spellcasters for generations. Some scholars have pointed out that specific details of these magical rituals have certain traits in common across all schools of magic and faith, leading some to believe that the ability to create devourers may have been introduced long ago as a single spell, perhaps provided by whatever malign forces lurk beyond the planes.

Another unusual facet of devourers’ existence is their strange response to a host of different spells, both powerful and weak. When one of these particular spells—mostly banishments or charms and compulsions—is cast on a devourer, there’s a chance that it instead causes the devourer to lose its hold on whatever spirit it has trapped in its chest, allowing the captive to escape off to its designated afterlife. No one is entirely sure why this is; perhaps the mind-affecting effects interact strangely with whatever madness or alien compulsions already drive the devourers, or the banishments can’t figure out where to send a creature that is effectively from beyond the planes. What is known, however, is that on those rare occasions when devourers have been cast back out to the space beyond reality, they have always found their way back with shocking ease.

Habitat &amp; Society
Like a black stain upon the proper flow of souls in the cosmos, devourers face revulsion from most other beings. They forsake their own spiritual evolution for undeath, and opportunistically feed upon other souls. A devourer’s hunger heavily colors its interaction with other races, and even those more powerful creatures who command devourers, or the lesser creatures who serve devourers, may find themselves under attack when a devourer grows tired of them or feels they’ve outlived their usefulness. Devourers are pragmatic to the extreme and highly secretive, but willing to serve greater masters should it serve their needs and offer a way to advance their current fixation.

Without occasionally feeding, devourers lose the use of their magical abilities, though in reality, the fact that a devourer can survive without a trapped soul for indefinite periods of time makes the “feeding” analogy break down. Instead, souls are simply capsules of energy that can be stored and used up, like batteries. It is perhaps for this reason that a devourer feeding has no orgiastic or sacramental aspect to it. To a devourer, consuming souls is simply a means to an end.

Devourers spend their undead existence pursuing bizarre and alien notions that make little to no sense to anyone else. Intensely fixated on certain things both philosophical and more concrete, their soul-hunting often seems to be of secondary importance to these less concrete goals. As a race born from planar explorers but denied such interplanar transportation magic themselves, devourers are obsessed with planar lore and gates, and seek ever more efficient ways to wander the cosmos on their strange errands. Altogether, their interests encompass an alien corpus of irrational, often blasphemous and dangerous knowledge, much of it presumably linked back to the mysterious force that led to their creation and which might continue to inf luence them.

Whether a devourer remembers its previous life or not, what it was prior to becoming a devourer may have some inf luence upon its undeath. Former clerics may sometimes arrange small, meaningless shrines or perform incomprehensible prayers, while former wizards may continue to collect bits of obscure lore or perform experiments to advance their knowledge. Each clue to their past, however, is invariably juxtaposed with other collections of bizarre ephemera, books written in the obsessive detail of hypergraphia, and even corpses left to rot next to others that were hung, carefully preserved, and painted with freakish, meaningless patterns.

In addition to being extremely rare, devourers almost always avoid each other, though it’s unclear whether this is simply a natural aversion to others of their kind or a necessary factor in fulfilling their arcane and far-reaching agendas. Perhaps it’s that devourers are heralds of their unknown creators, preparing to deliver the planes to their masters, and thus having more than one in a given area is unnecessary. Whatever the case, those who encounter even the most seemingly civilized and sane of devourers should remember that these soul-hungry undead appear to have been sent back not just as predators, but as direct agents of otherness.

Devourers are unholy abominations, gaunt giants who have seen beyond the trappings of mundane reality, and who have had some part of themselves twisted by the knowledge. Though skeletal and decayed, a devourer is no mere zombie, and goes about pursuing its alien goals while carrying a struggling, wailing soul in its hollow and cavernous rib cage, slowly consuming the captured spirit’s essence and condemning it to a fate worse than any hell.

While the Outer Planes are unimaginably vast, and in many ways can be considered to be infinite, there have long been questions about what lies beyond them. This is not merely the darkness and strange voids between distant stars on the Material Plane, but something fundamentally different—a beyond for the Great Beyond. Information about this otherness is almost completely unavailable, with even the gods seemingly deaf to most questions, yet there are always a few who to decide to see for themselves. When powerful fiends and evil spellcasters undertake this quest, some come back and report nothing but vast expanses of… well, nothing. Others don’t return at all. Yet some—the foulest ones, or those who become lost beyond the multiverse’s reaches—find something out there that changes them. These return with twisted, emaciated bodies and alien consciousnesses totally different from their original personalities, and bear an overwhelming hunger for soul energies, which they use to fuel their magical abilities. Though these maddened beings possess genius-level intellects, a strange ability to ignore many spells, and significant necromantic powers, most stories and legends ignore these aspects to focus instead on the wriggling, doomed spirits trapped and being digested within the devourers’ chests—the source of both their name and their infamy. Devourers can cause devastating damage with a touch, and those foes killed in this fashion find their souls forcibly drawn out and trapped inside the devourer’s body, where their essence is leeched away and used for spellcasting. Devourers can only consume a single soul at a time, absorbing it piece by piece as they utilize their magical abilities, and must finish off or relinquish one soul in order to consume and utilize another. For a trapped soul, the only real hope is that someone will target its captor with one of the eclectic collection of spells that can cause a devourer to momentarily lose control of the spirit, allowing the imprisoned soul to escape. Upon occasion, those wishing to obtain the release of a captive soul have attempted to bargain with the devourer, offering it a more powerful soul in exchange, but in these situations a devourer often simply burns up the last of its current soul energy in capturing the new morsel. Those souls that are successfully released and resurrected come back weaker and drained—and those destroyed completely by the devourer’s consumption cannot be brought back by anything less than the most powerful mortal magic.

Those rare few who peaceably encounter devourers—generally other powerful evil entities, or necromancers who call devourers into being through magic—all describe similar, disturbing traits. Though extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, devourers have a tendency to speak in weird riddles and half-sentences, babble in unknown languages, or respond to bizarre questions that no one had asked. Though devourers never discuss just who or what they’re talking to, many suspect their madness rises from a lingering connection to whatever sinister, alien entity or force made them what they are, and the devourers themselves sometimes let apparent titles slip, with appellations like the Dire Shepherd or the Wanderer Upon the Stair.

For all their madness, and despite their capacity for soul-annihilation, devourers are not creatures of mindless hunger, rampaging across the land. Instead they wander the planes, taking up new souls as needed but generally paying little attention to most other creatures, simply because their minds are elsewhere, occupied with more important things. The exception to this arises when devourers run across those individuals who, for one reason or another, play into their alien goals. Should they turn out to be foes, devourers show no mercy and leave nothing in their wake, not even the whispers of the dead.

Ultimately, devourers’ role in the cosmos remains a mystery, revealed individually and on a timescale not rushed by mortality. The whispers of places beyond the planes play across their atrophied synapses, calling them forth from the darkness—and it is to these places that they owe their only allegiance. Mortal necromancers and more powerful creatures may command devourers, but only the foolish claim to understand them.

&lt;p&gt;By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer’s chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer’s destruction (or a spell deflection—see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell’s level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained—these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/strong&gt; (Su)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected—success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

They do not find their rebirth, their unholy transfiguration, in a specific place or plane. Rather, far beyond the knowledge and sight of mortals or outsiders, they experience some sort of transformative gnosis, realizing some infectious idea that simultaneously destroys and recreates them with a new form and a new hunger. Whether or not there might be something out there that actively calls to them, compulsively drawing them to its presence and making them into what they are, is anyone’s guess, yet it would explain why only evil outsiders and spellcasters seem to be susceptible, and also potentially why the strange mannerisms of the devourers who return to the planes seem more than simple madness. It’s even possible that some devourers themselves might not be aware of their precise origins, and their obsessions could be attempts to find their way back and discover who or what made them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those devourers created (or potentially called from elsewhere) by magic share all the traits and madness of their transformed kin, a fact that has confused spellcasters for generations. Some scholars have pointed out that specific details of these magical rituals have certain traits in common across all schools of magic and faith, leading some to believe that the ability to create devourers may have been introduced long ago as a single spell, perhaps provided by whatever malign forces lurk beyond the planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unusual facet of devourers’ existence is their strange response to a host of different spells, both powerful and weak. When one of these particular spells—mostly banishments or charms and compulsions—is cast on a devourer, there’s a chance that it instead causes the devourer to lose its hold on whatever spirit it has trapped in its chest, allowing the captive to escape off to its designated afterlife. No one is entirely sure why this is; perhaps the mind-affecting effects interact strangely with whatever madness or alien compulsions already drive the devourers, or the banishments can’t figure out where to send a creature that is effectively from beyond the planes. What is known, however, is that on those rare occasions when devourers have been cast back out to the space beyond reality, they have always found their way back with shocking ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habitat &amp;amp; Society
Like a black stain upon the proper flow of souls in the cosmos, devourers face revulsion from most other beings. They forsake their own spiritual evolution for undeath, and opportunistically feed upon other souls. A devourer’s hunger heavily colors its interaction with other races, and even those more powerful creatures who command devourers, or the lesser creatures who serve devourers, may find themselves under attack when a devourer grows tired of them or feels they’ve outlived their usefulness. Devourers are pragmatic to the extreme and highly secretive, but willing to serve greater masters should it serve their needs and offer a way to advance their current fixation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without occasionally feeding, devourers lose the use of their magical abilities, though in reality, the fact that a devourer can survive without a trapped soul for indefinite periods of time makes the “feeding” analogy break down. Instead, souls are simply capsules of energy that can be stored and used up, like batteries. It is perhaps for this reason that a devourer feeding has no orgiastic or sacramental aspect to it. To a devourer, consuming souls is simply a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devourers spend their undead existence pursuing bizarre and alien notions that make little to no sense to anyone else. Intensely fixated on certain things both philosophical and more concrete, their soul-hunting often seems to be of secondary importance to these less concrete goals. As a race born from planar explorers but denied such interplanar transportation magic themselves, devourers are obsessed with planar lore and gates, and seek ever more efficient ways to wander the cosmos on their strange errands. Altogether, their interests encompass an alien corpus of irrational, often blasphemous and dangerous knowledge, much of it presumably linked back to the mysterious force that led to their creation and which might continue to inf luence them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a devourer remembers its previous life or not, what it was prior to becoming a devourer may have some inf luence upon its undeath. Former clerics may sometimes arrange small, meaningless shrines or perform incomprehensible prayers, while former wizards may continue to collect bits of obscure lore or perform experiments to advance their knowledge. Each clue to their past, however, is invariably juxtaposed with other collections of bizarre ephemera, books written in the obsessive detail of hypergraphia, and even corpses left to rot next to others that were hung, carefully preserved, and painted with freakish, meaningless patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being extremely rare, devourers almost always avoid each other, though it’s unclear whether this is simply a natural aversion to others of their kind or a necessary factor in fulfilling their arcane and far-reaching agendas. Perhaps it’s that devourers are heralds of their unknown creators, preparing to deliver the planes to their masters, and thus having more than one in a given area is unnecessary. Whatever the case, those who encounter even the most seemingly civilized and sane of devourers should remember that these soul-hungry undead appear to have been sent back not just as predators, but as direct agents of otherness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devourers are unholy abominations, gaunt giants who have seen beyond the trappings of mundane reality, and who have had some part of themselves twisted by the knowledge. Though skeletal and decayed, a devourer is no mere zombie, and goes about pursuing its alien goals while carrying a struggling, wailing soul in its hollow and cavernous rib cage, slowly consuming the captured spirit’s essence and condemning it to a fate worse than any hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Outer Planes are unimaginably vast, and in many ways can be considered to be infinite, there have long been questions about what lies beyond them. This is not merely the darkness and strange voids between distant stars on the Material Plane, but something fundamentally different—a beyond for the Great Beyond. Information about this otherness is almost completely unavailable, with even the gods seemingly deaf to most questions, yet there are always a few who to decide to see for themselves. When powerful fiends and evil spellcasters undertake this quest, some come back and report nothing but vast expanses of… well, nothing. Others don’t return at all. Yet some—the foulest ones, or those who become lost beyond the multiverse’s reaches—find something out there that changes them. These return with twisted, emaciated bodies and alien consciousnesses totally different from their original personalities, and bear an overwhelming hunger for soul energies, which they use to fuel their magical abilities. Though these maddened beings possess genius-level intellects, a strange ability to ignore many spells, and significant necromantic powers, most stories and legends ignore these aspects to focus instead on the wriggling, doomed spirits trapped and being digested within the devourers’ chests—the source of both their name and their infamy. Devourers can cause devastating damage with a touch, and those foes killed in this fashion find their souls forcibly drawn out and trapped inside the devourer’s body, where their essence is leeched away and used for spellcasting. Devourers can only consume a single soul at a time, absorbing it piece by piece as they utilize their magical abilities, and must finish off or relinquish one soul in order to consume and utilize another. For a trapped soul, the only real hope is that someone will target its captor with one of the eclectic collection of spells that can cause a devourer to momentarily lose control of the spirit, allowing the imprisoned soul to escape. Upon occasion, those wishing to obtain the release of a captive soul have attempted to bargain with the devourer, offering it a more powerful soul in exchange, but in these situations a devourer often simply burns up the last of its current soul energy in capturing the new morsel. Those souls that are successfully released and resurrected come back weaker and drained—and those destroyed completely by the devourer’s consumption cannot be brought back by anything less than the most powerful mortal magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those rare few who peaceably encounter devourers—generally other powerful evil entities, or necromancers who call devourers into being through magic—all describe similar, disturbing traits. Though extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, devourers have a tendency to speak in weird riddles and half-sentences, babble in unknown languages, or respond to bizarre questions that no one had asked. Though devourers never discuss just who or what they’re talking to, many suspect their madness rises from a lingering connection to whatever sinister, alien entity or force made them what they are, and the devourers themselves sometimes let apparent titles slip, with appellations like the Dire Shepherd or the Wanderer Upon the Stair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all their madness, and despite their capacity for soul-annihilation, devourers are not creatures of mindless hunger, rampaging across the land. Instead they wander the planes, taking up new souls as needed but generally paying little attention to most other creatures, simply because their minds are elsewhere, occupied with more important things. The exception to this arises when devourers run across those individuals who, for one reason or another, play into their alien goals. Should they turn out to be foes, devourers show no mercy and leave nothing in their wake, not even the whispers of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, devourers’ role in the cosmos remains a mystery, revealed individually and on a timescale not rushed by mortality. The whispers of places beyond the planes play across their atrophied synapses, calling them forth from the darkness—and it is to these places that they owe their only allegiance. Mortal necromancers and more powerful creatures may command devourers, but only the foolish claim to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I ask because while playing our Rise of the Runelords Campaign (some setbacks but onto Book Six after almost three years!) we've hit a few areas where the DM has told us outright that we could be killed by anything we run into - most notably &gt;!the many wings of Runeforge!&lt; and most recently the &gt;!Lower City of Xin-Shalast!&lt; \- which, being a paranoid and being afflicted with altitis as I am, would give me an excuse to bring out my rolling roster of characters, each with backstories I can adjust to fit almost any situation. 

To clarify; we haven't died, aren't near death, nor in immediate danger - however the GM repeatedly stressed the potential for a TPK. 

But I was frustrated by the GM telling us that it would be nearly impossible to introduce a new character in either of these spoilered locations. We were offered the chance to play NPCs (if anything is guaranteed to make me spit nails it's the idea of playing an NPC), which made me curious; why couldn't we bring in new characters of our own? Many reasons and handwavium clouds were thrown around, ultimately boiling down to not being allowed to play X,Y,or Z -where X,Y and Z are pretty much any original character designs - and having to essentially put on whatever hat the GM decides to provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Curious, I took this conundrum to the other DMs I work with; I pitched a few ideas  that I felt were very flexible; the most mundane were escaped experiments, slaves or prisoners, rebellious recruits, that kind of thing; the most exotic was a pair of characters, each frozen in mystic amber and placed alongside one another, just waiting for any willing creature to provide the trigger word to unleash one of them from their ancient, millenia-old prison and join the party. Finally, the no-brainer-let's-just-play-now-roll-some-goddamn-dice option of a surprise teleportation/plane shift that drops a fresh character in the party's lap with some convenient excuse to work and bond with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every other GM I spoke to immediately came up with two or three fresh ideas off the top of *their* heads that were either better or more convenient for the campaign. On top of that, one GM completely ran away with my Demolition Man idea and would have incorporated BOTH frozen characters into the story. Another GM thought the escaped captives idea was a bit tame and encouraged me to instead play up the rebel route which would let me swing a few more plot-linked items into the party to open up some story parts we might have missed. I worry because our Runelords GM is a very, VERY creative dude, but for some reason didn't seem to want me bringing in a character of my own.

When removed from the scabbard the wielder must within the next minute draw blood from a living creature. If they fail to do so, they must make a DC 16 Will save or else turn the blade on their allies, or on themselves. This will save must be repeated once per minute until the blade draws blood. Willingly cutting oneself with the blade deals 1d4 damage, and inflicts 1 point of bleed damage. The blade has a +1 to attack rolls, a +2 to damage rolls, and inflicts 1 point of bleed damage on any target it hits. (In addition to its base stats. I used a katana, but there is no reason the same effect couldn't be applied to other edged weapons.)

The goblets are identical in appearance, even to the well-trained eye. When a liquid is poured in one goblet, if there is already liquid in the other they are magically switched. The effect is hard to spot, but a DC 22 Perception check will notice when the switch occurs. The goblets must be within 1 mile for this effect to occur, and if they are filled further away than 1 mile and then brought closer together, the liquids inside will switch.

Hey so my DM has made it clear we might have set off a delayed nuke on our world. With that in mind he has started to open up resources for next campaign, claiming it to be Xcom-like. He explained death is going to be harder to come back from and he expects us to plan out attacks more.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get in to my character here is some creation info for this campaign. Its gestalt,  rolling 3d6+6 drop lowest for attributes (I got 12, 15, 15, 16, 16, 18), [Alternate crafting rules](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/alternate-crafting-rules/),  guns are now repetitively common and only misfire on a 1 now, you can ""flank"" at range so long as someone threatens your target but you don't get +2 to attack bonus, clerics get a bonus feat 1st level.

&amp;#x200B;

I fell in love with the idea of making an [Promethean Alchemist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/archetypes/paizo-alchemist-archetypes/promethean-alchemist-alchemist-archetype) and making tailored golems for the problems. I also thought it would work well to have the [Wasteland Blighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/archetypes/paizo-alchemist-archetypes/wasteland-blighter/) and [Chirurgeon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/archetypes/paizo-alchemist-archetypes/chirurgeon/) archetypes as well given that I was thinking of making my second class be a [Forgemaster Cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf/forgemaster-cleric-dwarf/). My DM has agreed that the Runeforger ability will work on my golems for any rune that can be placed on a Weapon, Shield, and Armor.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue comes in discovery feats and, well, clerics, I have never played a cleric so I am not sure what I am giving up here. I thought that the at will standard action mending from my [Artifice Domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/artifice-domain) would be worth it to heal my constructs but I'm not sure. As for discoveries, I lose access to bomb and mutagen/Cognatogen based ones tho I wasn't sure if I could take [Inspiring Cognatogen](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/inspiring-cognatogen-su) as it doesn't seem to list the base Cognatogen as a requirement. My other discovery ideas were:

&amp;#x200B;

[Spontaneous Healing (Ex)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/spontaneous-healing-ex),    [Healing Touch (Ex)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/healing-touch-ex),    [Preserve Organs (Ex)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/preserve-organs-ex),    [Mummification (Ex)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/mummification-ex) (extra crafting time if I don't need sleep right?),    [Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/alchemical-simulacrum-su),    [Doppelganger Simulacrum (Su)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/doppelganger-simulacrum-su).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what else would be useful or how to get them in a decent order. As for feats I have no idea what to take, and like I said I have never played a cleric before so not to sure about that ether. We do get 2 traits and a campaign trait.

* &gt;!Wall Defender: Begin with a Masterwork version of your starting weapon. Improved relations with Dwarves.!&lt;
* &gt;!Backwater Village: +2 on checks relating to villages or the villagers within. (Diplomacy checks to learn information, Knowledge Local checks in regards to villages, etc.)!&lt;
* &gt;!Scholar: +4 on the Knowledge Skill of your choice.!&lt;
* &gt;!Merchant: +3 to the speech skill of your choice. ( Diplomacy, Bluff, Sense Motive, Intimidate )!&lt;
* &gt;!Warrior: Gain +1 Attack and Damage with one weapon type of your choice.!&lt;
* &gt;!Nobility: Starting Gold +300gp.!&lt;
* &gt;!Apprentice: Begin the game knowing 2 additional 1st level spells from your class. Does not affect classes without spells known as well as classes lacking spellcasting abilities.!&lt;
* &gt;!Artisan: +2 to the Craft Skill of your choice.!&lt;
* &gt;!Explorer: +2 on Survival and Knowledge(Geography) checks.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

To those who read this far, thanks! Even if I don't get much help on this, I thought it would be a fun character to play and am hoping to make something unique here.

I've been DM'ing for a group for a fair bit of time now for a very diverse group of players.  For the most part, everyone gets along with only the occasional spat during bad days. However, one of our players, a gay male has two habits that several of the other players have taken note of and has at times been poked fun of, but it rears its head over and over and makes me and others uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

The first is directly related to his interaction with male npcs.  He flirts or makes passes at all of them. If that was it I wouldn't mind at all, but when he gets turned down or it becomes clear that the NPC is interested in women over men or just not interested in him, he starts pouting in and out of game (often accompanying this by posting gifs of crying usually the David Tennant in the rain meme or something else and this can go on for as long as an hour or more after the event.  He's had ample opportunities to flirt with other gay characters, has gone on several dates that were all played out and slept with three, so I'm giving him situations to 'be himself'.

&amp;#x200B;

That last sentence ties into the second.  Any time any of the other players who are either straight or lesbian become romantic, flirt or otherwise...he becomes very dismissive of everything they do and often says something along the lines of ""Ugh, straight people.""  Or just 'gross' when the lesbian has her turn.  The last time this happened I didn't say anything but I have no desire to constantly deal with it, especially not after I've talked with him and other players have talked to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help me with this?  I don't want to kick him from the group but because I'm straight he tends to downplay my opinions on sexuality or discomfort when someone is insulting mine and I don't want to drop the problem onto our trans player's lap to explain to him why its not cool.

I'm building Pathfinder 1e spell reference site. Mainly for mobile use.

&amp;#x200B;

[**scrollbear.com**](https://scrollbear.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm DMing for a few years for my friends. And during that time I tried to find all sorts of methods that would reduce the time to check the rules and other staff. On games I constantly use online references, such as Archives of Nethys or d20pfsrd. But I dm games with a laptop, so for me it's more comfortable than for my players.

All of my players are using  paper characters sheets. And the biggest problem with that was to manage spell slots and spell descriptions. And the above-mentioned reference sites are not the most convenient for mobile navigation. In the end, I decided to make my own website that would help with this. Something where you can quickly choose or find the right spell.

## Site

The site itself I tried to make equally convenient for desktop or mobile. Also, this site works in offline, which can sometimes be useful.

I didn't do any login or authorization so all selected options are saved on the device like in native apps. Maybe someday I will add something to synchronize data from different devices.

## Spell Reference

For now you can add spells into favorite, search by name, class or school of magic. In the future, I plan to add more filters (and perhaps the choice of source books, so you can choose only core book for example).

## Spellbook

My players and I used to use google sheets to track prepared spells and spellbooks. Now I transferred the same mechanics to my site. But some things are missing. No special slots, like domain, or selected schools of magic. And there is no possibility to prepare spells with metamagic.

But currently it's still enough for our games and when I find the time I will try to add other functionality.

## 

I really like to play Pathfinder. Especially because there are so many options, variety and depth. But because of all this, it is very difficult to manage different elements of the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I make this site for myself and my players. But maybe it will be useful to other players.

Am I missing anything significant to Pathfinder? DM doesn't want to get crazy on gear details, but I'd like a nod toward having anything that I should.

Way more detail than anyone probably wants:

Followup to a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/arc7zo/new_to_pathfinder_would_love_some_help_building_a/) (and huge thanks to all who helped)

I’ve played a good bit of 5e, and about to start a Pathfinder campaign at lvl 3. Since it’s a whole lot more complex, and my DM has some crazy homebrew, I would love some direction.

I’m going with a NG Oread Druid who gets a monstrous companion (via early access to Monstrous Companion Feat defined to include all magical beasts nerfed appropriate to level).

Race: Oread with Earth Insight, Granite Skin, and Mostly Human alternate traits and a homebrew Normal Speed in exchange for no darkvision

Class: Druid, thinking about the Pack Lord Archetype

Feats: Monstrous Companion (defined to include all magical beasts nerfed appropriate to level) Forgotton Past (Story Feat) Spell Focus (Conjuration)

Traits/Drawback: Overprotective (Drawback) Stoic Dignity Wisdom in the Flesh (Stealth)

Homebrew extras: Ferocity (Permanent) +2 Wis (DM bonus thing)

Current stat allocation: 16 / 15 / 13 / 15 / 17 / 10 (Base, yes DM's method is broken) 18 / 15 / 13 / 15 / 21 / 8 (Adjusted)

With the Forgotton Past and Oread Race, I’m thinking a go-with-the-flow dude who gets absent minded sometimes. He always knows what’s going on around him, but doesn’t always care. He doesn’t know how he got here, but isn’t so worried about it.

Companion: Polar Kamadan, adjusted to be appropriate to lvl.  Medium size, flies, no breath weapon.

Pretty much any resources are open, but subject to DM review.

Setting: safety in city, danger/ madness mist in wilderness.

Party: an Unchained Monk and a rogue + me.

My problem starts kind of like a set up for a joke. I'm DMing a campaign with eight very experienced players. A bard, ranger, cleric, paladin, barbarian, sorcerer and rogue. All level 12, and some of them are of the powerplaying persuasion. They usually know how to handle themselves.

**They've been stupid, tho**

They've set out into an immense forest trying to find the lair of a powerful Green Dragon. As a DM, I warned them that waltzing through a forest with an average score of minus 2 in stealth and heavy movement penalties would be like regular humans swimming through the ocean looking for Great White sharks. A bad idea. They did so anyway (somewhat heroically) knowing they had no plan in order to save other people. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Dragon has been surveiling them for at least 24 hours, and it finally started attacking them, but not in a stand and fight-way. A frustratingly harassing way. Stealthing, using its dragon senses, waiting out their buffs, cover of darkness, breath weapon, standard magic, never standing still, all kinds of nasty stuff. The players endured this attack for a few hours and decided to flee. Problem is, they're ten hours from the nearest safe location. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What to do?**

Advice for them? Tactics, tricks? I feel like I've enabled them to paint themselves into a corner and would like to see some new ideas on how to get out of dodge or fight back.

&amp;#x200B;

What if the weapon has no enhancement bonus? Or, what if the weapon is Masterwork and therefore only has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and none on damage? Does it just gain a +2 enhancement bonus (in which case is it now a magical weapon)?

&amp;#x200B;

One interpretation might be that, since it has no enhancement bonus to modify, the weapon does not gain the +2 enhancement bonus increase (or a masterwork weapon would only gain the increase on attack rolls). But another interpretation would say that, just because it currently has no enhancement bonuses does not mean you can't add the +2, which would give mundane weapons a +2 on attack and damage (masterworks would have a +3 attack and a +2 damage).

&amp;#x200B;

When I initially read the ability, I interpreted it in the former sense. I am pretty sure that the bane weapon special ability was not intended to be used on weapons that did not already have an enhancement bonus on both attack and damage.

####Appearance  

####CR 4  
#####Alignment:  CN
#####Size:   Small
####Special Abilities  

Blood-Freezing Howl (Su) As a standard action, a voonith can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for an additional 1d6 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against a voonith’s howl is immune to the same voonith’s howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Cunning and aggressive, vooniths are amphibious nocturnal predators with voracious appetites and mild intelligence. A voonith’s howl is said to freeze the blood and is more than capable of stopping a creature in its tracks. Vooniths usually howl when they see prey too far away from the water’s edge to ambush. While the vooniths are native to the strange Dimension of Dream, many have found their way out of that realm and into the waking world to take up lairs in the swampy fens and remote coastlines of the world. How the vooniths originally managed to make this transition between worlds is unclear.

Although they look like little more than wild beasts, vooniths are actually rather intelligent. While certainly not as sharp as the average human, a voonith is smart enough to know how to speak and often does so with others of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate with other creatures, giving rise to the misconception that they’re little more than dumb animals, but on occasion, travelers in swampy regions tell tales of overhearing strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few who know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand these words, although understanding of what the vooniths whisper in the night when they think no one else can hear is not always for the best.

While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense of humor, and take great pleasure in concocting violent poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in which non-voonith creatures—particularly humans, cats, and gnomes—meet gory and ironic fates are the most entertaining to vooniths. Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conflict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who befriend travelers often escort them, quietly and unseen, through dangerous bogs, and when such travelers fall prey to other dangers of the swamp, a friendly voonith will provide what aid it can.

Vooniths are 4 feet long and weigh 70 pounds, yet rumors tell of vooniths that have grown to much larger sizes than this.

1. In the pit trap room I've changed the pit traps to hidden floor tiles that, when triggered, fore blunted arrows. It's the same idea as the pits, but instead of the four switched which is obvious if you know what to look for, they have to find four tiles that are buttons but don't trigger traps, those will act as switches for the door. 

2. Instead of a barricaded door that Roldare is hiding behind, I made it a trap door in the ground they have to find. 

3. Considering making the Kassen's blades trap actually be living statues they have to fight, still with blunted swords. Might be slight overkill though. 

4. Draugs instead of skeletons in the second skeleton fights. 

5. A direct bat, or pair of dire bats, instead of bat swarms on the lower level. 

6. In the flooded room with electrified moss, replace the moss with electric eels. 

These are just minor changes and would love some input on ideas or other changes GMs have made. I also really want to think of a way to change up the key pool, but am drawing a blank.

He poses as a halfling or gnome for most of the time and does so with a +28 bonus on Disguise checks. Therefore his true nature probably won't be revealed until he ""joins those, he cannot beat"" and becomes a real member of the party instead of a mole.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have two main issues to solve:

* *Which inquisition should I take?* Clandestine seems like an auto-pick, but Heresy lets me utilise Intimidate much much better. 
* *Should I add the Sanctified Slayer archetype?* Still unsure whether Judgements or Studied Target + Sneak Attack are better for him.  


Furthermore, but not pressing:

* *What's the best way to get DEX to damage for him?* Three levels of Unchained Rogue (with the Rake archetype he could become a nice intimidator)? 8k gold for an Agile weapon? Some feat chain? 
* *Is the size penalty for Intimidate based on actual or perceived size?* So a small creature appearing medium via e.g. Alter Self suffers the -4 penalty against medium sized targets?

I understand that, be RAW, they would not stack because it doesn't *explicitly* say so. However, by RAI, I am unsure of whether a Monk's unarmed damage stacks with the Brawler's unarmed damage. Many things kind of go for it(few thoughts listed below). So I am curious what everyone's opinions are on allowing it to stack.

I have read from a few other forum posts randomly about people debating {A)they should stack, B) they don't stack, C)even if they don't, it wouldn't be game breaking.} but none of them really have anything definitive or better than the other reasoning wise, for allowing it or not, just a bunch of arguing over what the person believes. 


Arguments for why I might allow it:
---Both classes have the same progression. The damage intended for a full monk or full brawler would be the same, so stacking doesn't make anything 'unbalanced' there, or else they'd be unbalanced on just a plain 20 monk.
---If someone wanted to multiclass into both(whatever merits there may be), the main reason they would want to do so is most likely to be a character that uses there fists for combat, not weapons, so why punish it?
---Martial Training allows you to qualify for feats as if her brawler levels were fighter and monk levels(seemingly saying that if you multiclassed as a 4 brawler/4 monk, you would essentially meaning you would be a 4monk/4monk-AKA an 8 monk- for a feat that had monk 8 as a prerequisite--*note, I am not referring to anything specifically, just an example*). It then goes on to say they [brawler levels] ""also count as a both fighter and a monk for feats and magic items"". The most used example discussed being monk robes. [Though I wouldn't allow the progression to get past a level 20 monk's with monk robes-FE a 20 monk + monk robes  would NOT = 25 Monk unarmed damage - and I don't think there is anything like that anyway.]. Though it also doesn't specify using this for features, so I understand the argument against it.
---Sneak attack damage is said to stack, but the idea behind the stacking doesn't seem that different to me. Extra damage, granted by the same class feature, just by separate classes. Sure, one is *added* to your damage under certain conditions (though, arguably not hard conditions), whereas the other just *sets* your base damage. Honestly, sneak attack stacks faster, and to a higher total anyway: every 2 levels, and extra d6, to a max of 10d6, vs a medium creatures unarmed damage: every 4 levels, moving up 1 category, to a max of 2d10. 

Why I might not:
---Monastic  Legacy-lets you count non-monk levels(every 4) as if they were monk levels, to progress unarmed damage. If it wasn't for the prerequisite for Still Mind, I would allow this to be the way to do the above, but it is only applicable to monks with Still Mind. Meaning even some archetypes can't get it.-Which isn't quite the same as minimum monk level x prerequisite(which is what I think this should be instead-monk lvl3).
---Allowing this to happen opens up the ""pandora's box' of new ways of becoming abusable, but I think most things can be if you try hard enough...so lets not *focus* on that.

I love Pathfinder, but I think there's definitely some room for improvement. One of the things that's always bugged me is how little bonus it is to have flanking on a creature, particularly as you get to higher levels. To me, flanking an enemy (or being flanked) should be much bigger boon to the attackers than a flat +2 attack, and should reflect how much the pc/creature relies on superior mobility and dexterity. And a flat +2 just doesn't express that like I think it should, and it doesn't scale as your PC's get deadlier and level up.

The most reasonable and somewhat balanced solution I've thought of is to have all flanking attacks made against flat-footed AC. I know ""realism"" isn't necessarily a big part of the mechanics of this game, but the switch to flat-footed works well visually with creatures that are especially nimble vs large and clumsy. A pair of guys with flanking against say, an [elephant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant), get basically no advantage on their attack. Which makes sense. Fred standing on the other side isn't going to make it any easier for me to hit this big-ass animal. As opposed to getting flanking on something nimble and fast, like a swashbuckler, which seems like having flanking on should provide a much larger benefit, as you've negated his speed/dexterity advantage. I realize this probably has some big oversight that I'm not thinking of, and I also realize it would skew the balance of certain feats/abilities like [stance of the xorn](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/stance-of-the-xorn-combat/) for instance.

## Elven Spirit

Although you are of mixed heritage, you are closer to your elven relatives and the magic in their blood flows freely in your veins.

**Benefit**: You possess the elven magic racial trait of the elves, granting you a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition, you receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties of magic items. Alternatively, you can instead gain ***any one racial trait that elves can exchange for the elven magic racial trait.***

**Special**: You can only take this feat at 1st level. If you take this feat, you cannot take the Human Spirit feat.

**Lightbringer**: Many elves revere the sun, moon, and stars, but some are literally infused with the radiant power of the heavens. Elves with this racial trait are ***immune to light-based blindness*** and dazzle effects, and are treated as one level higher when determining the effects of any light-based spell or effect they cast (including spell-like and supernatural abilities). Elves with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher may use *light* at will as a spell-like ability. This racial trait replaces the elven immunities and ***elven magic*** racial traits.

I am building a paladin for a Kingmaker campaign and for a change I have decided to try mounted build but I run into several dilemmas and grey rule areas and I need your sagely advice.

Let’s start by saying that Leadership is for now off the table and this not a PFS game. I also try to play it by RAW although I can always ask nicely the GM as a last resort

\-----

**1)** **Problem**: paladins don’t get a mount at lvl 1Solution: buy a combat trained Heavy horse or if DM allows it a combat trained Bison. A trait for more gold will be needed.

**2)** **Problem**: Medium Paladins have very limited selection of Divine bond mounts.Solution: the feat [Monstrous Mount](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/monstrous-mount/) give’s a Griffin however it requires 2 feats at lvl 5 and 7 to make it worthwhile. Other feats exist such as [Beast Rider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/beast-rider-orc-half-orc)(Orc/Half-Orc) that requires lvl 7 and is race specific or [Wolf Rider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/wolf-rider/), though I can’t say I am impressed by either.

**3)** **Problem:** For animal companions that lack fly speed it’s is annoyingly difficult to give them a way to “fly” as a paladin. You either need i) some expensive magic item that makes it more of a late game thing and even then it might need to be costume made to be usable by your mount, ii) lose actions and spellslots to cast a spell that allows it to fly (as a paladin I think there is one at lvl 3 (Sky Steed) and maybe angelic aspect greater (via share spells) or iii) beg a friendly caster if one is part of your team to use their resourses.

**4)** **Problem**: mounted combat requires to dump skillpoints to two skills not really useful otherwise (ride &amp; handle animal) and for a paladin that might want to dump Int that’s more than he might have! Also feat wise it requires quite a lot especially if you want to have other fun feats like **Fey Foundling** or **Power Attack** or **Monstrous mount** and family, making Human seem like a one way.Solution: for skill points not really any. Int must at minimum be 10, the higher the better to have things to do when not fighting. Human will give you a skill point and a lvl 1 feat.Another way to go is to ignore the [spirited charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spirited-charge-combat/) route and Dip 1 lvl into Sohei for [Mounted skirmisher](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mounted-skirmisher-combat/) ( if you can make sweet eyes yo your GM to allow an Unchained Sohei from everyman’s conversion even better).

**5)** **Problem**: Animal Companions scale very badly at middle to higher LvLSolution: i) Deal with it, use it only as a means of transport/movement and consider your character as having pounce/flight ii) try to make your animal companion matter at late game with feats (like teamwork ones). But I think you only delay the inevitable that way. III) *Shenanigans!* Use 2 feats to get [Animal Ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/animal-ally). By raw as long as your divine bond mount is one that [Animal Ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/animal-ally) grants then your “Druid” level stuck for an Umber mount effect. There has been no FAQ as far as I know and only a ruling for PFS. I personally don’t find it too cheesy as you are basically restricted to a horse (that doesn’t fly nor has pounce) and even at lvl 20 (assuming you can progress the animal beyond the chart) It is comparable to an NPC warrior and you have used 2 feats. With **Beast rider** or **monstrous mount** it will worth more but then that’s another feat investment from you.

\--------

**1)** **Dilemma**: Is it worth using the archetype [Shining Knight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin/archetypes/paizo-paladin-archetypes/shining-knight/)? Basically you lose the ability to share your smites for the ability to allow your mount to benefit from your divine grace. As a side effect of losing your  11th lvl ability 9 (Aura of Justice) you can’t take *oath of vengeance* which is one of the best paladins archetypes (it even makes Rping a tad easier).

\-------

**1)** **Rule question:** the [Mammoth Lance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/specific-magic-weapons/mammoth-lance/) requires your mount to be an animal  i) At 11 lvl the animal companion becomes a magical beast (paladin divine bond) but I assume it’s only  counts so for which spells affect it thus you can use the lance normally  ii)  *assuming you can’t, can you use UMD to allow other kind of mounts as well?*

**2)** **Rule question:** Would “**Monstrous** **Mount**” affect the animal companion gained from “**Animal Ally**”. The prerequisites normally would not let you qualify but you do qualify from the paladins divine bond mount.

**3)** **Rule question:** a Griffin from “**Monstrous Mount**” is an *animal type or a magical beast type*? I would lean towards animal based on the feat’s text. This affects what spell interacts with it, effects such as bane and the mammoth lance so it is quite important.

\-------

Possible build if everything works as I think it does

**Race**: human | **stats**: 16 14 12 10 8 16+2 (point buy 25) (as it’s a kingmaker campaign and I hope to use the mammoth lance more emphasis on cha will be placed)

**Mount**: combat trained Bison or combat trained heavy horse (hopefully will survive to lvl 4)

**Feats:**LvL 1: fey foundling | human bonus feat: Nature Soul,

LvL 3: (something… craft wondrous maybe?)

LvL 4: retrain lvl 3 feat to Animal Ally

LvL 5: Monstrous mount -&gt; Griffin (animal companion is a lvl 7 (char lvl 5-2 from Animal Ally + 5 from Divine bond and it only gets better from her on)

LvL 7: Monstrous mount mastery | Dip 1 lvl Sohei for Mounted Skirmisher

LvL 9: Power attack (lol I know way too late)

Build is complete more or less. Good feats would be beast totem, evolved companion crafting feats to help equip both the char and the mount

\-------

I would really appreciate if you could:

1. answer the rule questions I have
2. Give your insight on the Shining knight archetype (worth it or not)
3. And suggest better solutions to the problems I encounter while trying to make a paladin mounted build. In particular ways to permanently grant the ability of flight to the mount (by lvl 5 to 7) would appreciated

Reminder: No leadership and family. Everything else goes with a priority on being Raw and first party material.

I have kids and homeschool, and I'm fairly evangelistic about kids and RPGs. As a result, I spend a decent amount of time in the Beginner Box. I really like the PFS kids track lessons for teaching new kids to play. For anyone unfamiliar, they use the Beginner Box Bash Demos (BBBD) to reinforce lessons about dice, classes, skills, etc. Each of the BBBD has a map tile pack associated with it, and I'd love to get those map tile packs, but I feel like if I'm just using them for that, even if I run a new group of kids through them every year, I'm barely using these map tiles that I paid money for (especially since most BBBD only use 1-2 tiles out of the pack). *So, my question is, do any of you know of any resources that make use of the map tile sets?* As an example, the Academy of Secrets adventure module uses the Magic Academy map tiles as the maps for the entire adventure (which is why I chose that set of map tiles to buy first). 

The map tile packs, in order of use in the Kids Track are: Ruins, Dungeon Sites, Magic Academy (not worried about this one), Crypts. Other BBBD map packs: Ice Cavern, Farmstead, Lost Island, Palace, Ship's Cabin.

The second Beginner Box adventure that can be found in the Beginner Box GM kit uses the Mines map pack. 

To be clear, I'm not *only* interested in Beginner Box adventures, though I'm always interested in adding to my beginner adventure collection. Mostly, I just want to be able to justify to myself buying the map packs that I will use first with the Beginner Box stuff. And I know I could come up with my own stuff to use them, or use them for random encounters or whatever, but I haven't made time for creating my own adventures since 3e D&amp;D came out (mostly after some jokes from my players about how all my adventures involved people being kidnapped).

The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh—in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask.


Oni are a race of evil spirits, native to the Material Plane, that manifest physical bodies based upon the shapes and desires of humanoid mortals. In pure spirit form, an oni is nothing but a disembodied evil longing for the sins of the flesh. In this form, oni are harmless and invisible. The majority of these bodiless oni were once kami who failed their wards, or more often, who deliberately abandoned them. As punishment, they were stripped of their ability to form a physical body and then cast into the void. Rarely, a mortal creature's soul can become a disembodied oni upon death, or in even rarer cases, after a truly evil individual has undergone a particularly vile ritual that ends in suicide. These oni are more often destined for positions of great power and strength than most. 

Eventually, an oni's spirit manifests a physical body on the Material Plane. The methods by which this may occur vary, but the process generally takes place in areas already despoiled by sin, tragedy, or cruelty. The type of oni a spirit transforms into is influenced by a wide variety of variables, ranging from the nature of what the oni spirit was before to the location where it is reborn into the realm of flesh and blood. Once an oni manifests its physical body, that body becomes its true form for the rest of its life—all oni are shapechangers, but this original form is the form in which they are born and the form they revert to upon death. 

An oni's true form is always similar to that of a specific type of humanoid, save that it is always deformed and monstrous to look upon. Tusks, additional eyes, or strangely colored skin are common physical attributes. Yet while they have hideous forms, all oni are capable of changing their shape to assume forms more pleasant to the civilized eye. The type of shapes an oni can assume depend upon its species, but all can transform into some form of humanoid. Oni use this ability to infiltrate humanoid societies, either to prey upon the weak or to rule them in disguise. 

In order to understand oni, it is important to consider that most of these beings were once spirits tasked with protecting a material realm they now believe is undeserving of such care and concern—indeed, the physical world is to be dominated and consumed. They arrive in physical form starved for sensory experience, and never fully sate their desire to gorge on such experiences. Most oni seek to attain positions of leadership and power, often in the guise of a normal humanoid, in order to secure a never-ending supply of sensory experiences. It is also important to understand that oni's immoderation is also motivated by their corrupted and evil natures—that is, no pleasure is more enjoyable than one that deprives or wounds another. 

Oni retain their hatred of the kami upon reentering the Material Plane as physical creatures, and often their depredations and violations of the world can be directly tied to their efforts to destroy kami or the kami's works. Oni tend not to congregate with others of their kind, being most comfortable in positions of leadership over enslaved or oppressed societies populated by humanoids they can masquerade as. Yet, at times, particularly powerful oni abandon this mindset and instead gather to their side entire legions of oni drawn from all types. The oni known collectively as the yai—oni with an affinity for true giants—are most often responsible for such actions, and when a yai builds such an army of oni, the humanoid lands shake with terror. 

Theoretically, as many types of oni exist as there are types of humanoids, although in reality, certain types of oni are much more populous than others. The ogre mage, an oni associated with ogres, is the best-known and most commonly encountered type of oni, for reasons that still send scholars of oni lore into spiraling arguments with seemingly no end. Beyond the oni detailed on the following pages, the atamahuta (ettins), ja noi (hobgoblins), nogitsune (kitsune), and wind yai (cloud giants) are relatively well known. Oni with associations to bugbears, great cyclopes, stone giants, trolls, troglodytes, and other races exist as well. And above even the mighty void yai there exist the oni demigods—entities of nearly incomprehensible power known as the oni daimyo.

&lt;p&gt;Clad in beautiful armor, this exotically garbed giant roars, its tusks glistening and its eyes afire with murderous intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Alignment:  LE&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Size:   Large&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Special Abilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spell-Like Abilities (CL 9th)
Constant—fly
At will—darkness, invisibility
1/day—charm monster (DC 17), cone of cold (DC 18), gaseous form, deep slumber (DC 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ecology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh—in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oni are a race of evil spirits, native to the Material Plane, that manifest physical bodies based upon the shapes and desires of humanoid mortals. In pure spirit form, an oni is nothing but a disembodied evil longing for the sins of the flesh. In this form, oni are harmless and invisible. The majority of these bodiless oni were once kami who failed their wards, or more often, who deliberately abandoned them. As punishment, they were stripped of their ability to form a physical body and then cast into the void. Rarely, a mortal creature&amp;#39;s soul can become a disembodied oni upon death, or in even rarer cases, after a truly evil individual has undergone a particularly vile ritual that ends in suicide. These oni are more often destined for positions of great power and strength than most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, an oni&amp;#39;s spirit manifests a physical body on the Material Plane. The methods by which this may occur vary, but the process generally takes place in areas already despoiled by sin, tragedy, or cruelty. The type of oni a spirit transforms into is influenced by a wide variety of variables, ranging from the nature of what the oni spirit was before to the location where it is reborn into the realm of flesh and blood. Once an oni manifests its physical body, that body becomes its true form for the rest of its life—all oni are shapechangers, but this original form is the form in which they are born and the form they revert to upon death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An oni&amp;#39;s true form is always similar to that of a specific type of humanoid, save that it is always deformed and monstrous to look upon. Tusks, additional eyes, or strangely colored skin are common physical attributes. Yet while they have hideous forms, all oni are capable of changing their shape to assume forms more pleasant to the civilized eye. The type of shapes an oni can assume depend upon its species, but all can transform into some form of humanoid. Oni use this ability to infiltrate humanoid societies, either to prey upon the weak or to rule them in disguise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand oni, it is important to consider that most of these beings were once spirits tasked with protecting a material realm they now believe is undeserving of such care and concern—indeed, the physical world is to be dominated and consumed. They arrive in physical form starved for sensory experience, and never fully sate their desire to gorge on such experiences. Most oni seek to attain positions of leadership and power, often in the guise of a normal humanoid, in order to secure a never-ending supply of sensory experiences. It is also important to understand that oni&amp;#39;s immoderation is also motivated by their corrupted and evil natures—that is, no pleasure is more enjoyable than one that deprives or wounds another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oni retain their hatred of the kami upon reentering the Material Plane as physical creatures, and often their depredations and violations of the world can be directly tied to their efforts to destroy kami or the kami&amp;#39;s works. Oni tend not to congregate with others of their kind, being most comfortable in positions of leadership over enslaved or oppressed societies populated by humanoids they can masquerade as. Yet, at times, particularly powerful oni abandon this mindset and instead gather to their side entire legions of oni drawn from all types. The oni known collectively as the yai—oni with an affinity for true giants—are most often responsible for such actions, and when a yai builds such an army of oni, the humanoid lands shake with terror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, as many types of oni exist as there are types of humanoids, although in reality, certain types of oni are much more populous than others. The ogre mage, an oni associated with ogres, is the best-known and most commonly encountered type of oni, for reasons that still send scholars of oni lore into spiraling arguments with seemingly no end. Beyond the oni detailed on the following pages, the atamahuta (ettins), ja noi (hobgoblins), nogitsune (kitsune), and wind yai (cloud giants) are relatively well known.

SO I'm a first time DM and I've been running a homebrew campaign for a little under a year now with 3 players, I have a tiefling slayer, a half-orc sorcerer, and a dhampir witch, and they are meeting Pharasma soon. Due to the overarching story of the campaign she's going to give them each a powerful ability/item that can be used in this last 1/3 of the campaign.

I'm giving my slayer an ability that I'm calling Changing Fates where once per day before an allied d20 is rolled he can decide what number comes out. (I think this is the cyclops ability but it's called something different).

My sorcerer is getting something I'm calling Fated Magic where anytime he rolls damage from a spell or spell-like ability he can reroll any 1s once (he's a Stormborn sorcerer so he can add electric damage to his melee attacks)

And then I have the witch.

Help!

My party is soon to be facing off against a horned devil and I’m hoping we can prevail with some help from you folks! Here’s some info on our party:

Me: Level 10 sorcerer (sorcerer 6/ dragon disciple 4)

PC: level 10 paladin

PC: level 10 rogue

NPC: level 10 alchemist

NPC: unknown level rock/lava golem thing

Gear: 

I don’t have much in the way of items other than things boosting my stats since I mainly cast spells but I do have 1749 platinum to spend. 

Here are my spells:

0 level: Acid Splash, Detect Magic, Read Magic, Light, Ray of Frost, Disrupt Undead, Mending, Arcane Mark. 

1st level: Protection from Evil, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shocking Grasp, Vanish. 

2nd level: Resist Energy, Create Pit, Flaming Sphere, Blur, Knock. 

3rd level: Dispel Magic, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Fly. 

4th level: Dimension Door, Greater Invisibility, and one more open slot that I have yet to pick. 

Our paladin has a long sword of quickening and blast of some kind, a shield with righteous might, and a bunch of stuff to boost his strength. 

Our rogue mainly uses a bow which is a +2 dragons bane bow. 

Our two NPC’s are played by our DM so all I know is the alchemist has some sort of gun and some grenade type thrown weapons. 

Typical strategy:

So far our usual strategy is for me to use Greater Invisibility on our rogue while she shoots, buff our paladin’s AC, then throw fireballs and lightning bolts while our paladin swings away. 

So here’s our issue, the horned devil’s AC is very high, even with all of our stuff, it would be difficult for our party to hit. Also, I’ve taken a lot of fire spells because of my characters back story and this devil is resistant to fire so I’m not sure how much help I’d be. In addition to those things, he has DR/good and none of us have good weapons or spells aside from our paladins healing spells which I think we are going to need. 

My only hope right now is to plead with our paladin’s deity to bless our weapons with the good property which I don’t think the DM will actually do and the paladin’s church doesn’t like us and won’t help. 

Needless to say we are in for a tough fight where some of us might die. Any tips or strategies you guys have would be really helpful! Thank you!

I had an idea for a campaign I want to run, where it starts off with the players working for some organization (or independently), wandering throughout a kingdom and looking into some strange goings-on. 

At about level... 5, I think is the first big change, they find out a bit of the larger scope, and discover that there's some 7 relics that they should collect, probably when they come across the first one. Each relic does something minor but useful, such as ""Cure light wounds X times per day,"" and there's several groups trying to hunt them down because collecting them all would supposedly allow one to become a god - and by finding a relic of their own, the players land on the radar of these groups (each an adventuring party in their own right). The players may or may not come into direct conflict with these groups, but the groups will at least hire people/use political maneuvering to try to get the players off the trail of the 7 relics. A few of these will be in a dungeon beneath the kingdom, but a few will be in the hands of these groups, which is why they acknowledge each other - these groups also know much more about what's going on than the players do, at least at first, but not the full truth.

The players should come across the sixth relic at around level 10, and the final relic will be owned by a Nightwalker at the bottom of the dungeon, a climactic boss fight for this segment. Once the players defeat the Nightwalker (or negate it somehow) and collect the seven relics, an angel will descend upon the capital city to await their arrival.

Once the players meet the angel, it will reveal a horrible truth about the world - it's been ravaged by Nightshades, the players have proven that mortals are ready to take them on, and this kingdom was the last bastion of mortals in this reality, and then it will shatter the barrier keeping the kingdom separate from the rest of the world, making the world a bigger place for the players to match their new powers.

I don't have an idea for how to expand the world again at level 15, though. Bring back the ascension to godhood thing, with the players recreating the dying world as they go and ushering in an age of heroism?

So a few questions: Would it be better to expand the world a level before the big change level, so the players grow into an appropriate power level for the new thing, or a session into the new level, so players have had a chance to play with their new powers before the world suddenly becomes a more threatening place?

I have a player that is an Investigator with Infusion. Usually he never gives his extracts away but prefer to get near the person and use a standard action to make him drink.  

I don't want to be a ""narrativist"" GM, but I don't feel like it's really correct. I mean, the fighter is swinging his greatsword, dodging attacks, avoiding spell and such and he just walks in and puts a potion in his mouth?

&amp;#x200B;

So I really would like RAW answers (Rule As Writtens) not interpretation based on simpaty or on how you interpretate rules.

Is it correct? Could he do it?

Also I have in another campaign an Alchemist, if this is correct I could just get a tumor familiar, and never drink extracts directly, but use him to make me drink, while I use my round to attack.

---

Guns are contentious.  Most people in a fantasy game like D&amp;D or Pathfinder take one look at them and go ""Eww, no!"" like someone had just asked to have unlimited wishes.  Even though in our real life history we've had guns for over a thousand years, the fact they weren't in things like Tolkien's work (mostly, he did mention black powder bombs) means most people don't associate them with fantasy in general.  After all, why create dangerous early firearms when its so much easier to just learn to shoot fire directly from your fingertips?

To answer this, we need to visit the region guns were invented in, namely the city-state of Alkenstar located in the Mana Wastes, and the dwarven hold there called Dongun Hold.  Now, the Mana Wastes lie between the nations of Nex and Geb, which themselves lie south of Osirion on the lower continent of Garund.  Nex and Geb were involved in a huge magical war from roughly -800 to 500 AR.  During which the battles got so bad that reality itself was damaged to the point it created vast tracks of magic deadzones.

The dwarves in Dongun Hold were right in the middle of it, and sealed themselves in to protect themselves during the war (rumor has it the magic they used to seal themselves off is what reacted with the magics Geb and Nex were throwing around to create the first deadzone).  In the thousands of years that followed, these dwarves invented the first guns due to the fact they had no magic (gotta find better ways to kill each other somehow, I suppose).  In 4588 AR a criminal by the name of Alkenstar fled into the Mana Wastes and ended up founding a city over the dwarven hold that shared his name.  They learned of the manufacture of guns from the dwarves during trade, and by 4620 AR had founded the Gunworks to officially start producing firearms to protect themselves from the various monsters and other threats (like the Gorilla King, seriously, look that one up!).  Due to intentionally low production rates in the Gunworks, 90% of all firearms created in Alkenstar STAY in Alkenstar, giving them a stranglehold on the technology (the Gunworks intentionally only produce one firearm a day normally specifically to limit availability).

The current year in default Golarion is 4710, meaning knowledge of the existence of guns by the outside world has only been around for less than a century, and even then it has been little more than a trickle of actual product.  Which means much of what is available in the Inner Sea region we are familiar with has likely been smuggled out of Alkenstar, is a more locally crafted copy, or is one of the rare ultra-markup trade goods trickling out of the southern region.

To put this in perspective, that means the only mass production center of guns in the setting is cranking out less than 50 individual weapons PER YEAR for export, which are having to be carried basically from the equivalent of Ethiopia to Europe on foot and by sailing ship.  Most of which are then likely being kept in private collections by wealthy collectors of rare and exotic items.  With availability this low, the gunslingers out there probably all know each other by name.

So there we go, a quick overview of guns in Golarion.  From how they came to be (an alternative to magic from a region where magic doesn't exist) to why they're still so rare (extremely low supply and extremely recent development on the world stage).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought it up that I&amp;#39;d like to see my favorite lore series do a video on firearms in Golarion because most people don&amp;#39;t seem to know much about it (I&amp;#39;ll admit, I was the same kneejerk &amp;quot;Eww, guns in a fantasy game, NO!&amp;quot; type player until I read up on it).

&lt;p&gt;This being the case, I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out the simplest way to solve the puzzle using the below components.  None of these are negotiable, and I just have to work within their constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race: Catfolk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class: Occultist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level: 10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability Scores: 20 point buy (I&amp;#39;m allowed to re-buy when my character changes forms)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My character curried favor with a deity and was given a boon to be able to increase one ability score by a +4 profane bonus, which can change when changing forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traits: One&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items Currently Possessed (this will be the biggest issue, as I likely won&amp;#39;t have the chance to acquire more items and will have to make do with what I have):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 flaming heavy flail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+2 longsword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mwk Longbow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 mithral buckler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 mithral armor (can change armor type once per character race/class change, but remains +3 mithral of that armor type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headband of Int +2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belt of Dex +2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amulet of Natural Armor +1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ring of Protection +2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloak of Resistance +3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will not have access to the Psychic Anthology sourcebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping all of the above in mind, what&amp;#39;s my best option?&lt;/p&gt;

Now, in our current predicament, the Asmodean Church has sided with the tyrant Queen, and the PCs need to sever that connection to secure power &amp; favor so they can depose the Queen. The problem is, they really have no way to actually make this happen, certainly not in the timeframe they need it to.

I've settled on one thing: I want to use Baphomet here. The Demon Lord branded by Asmodeus and bearing a permanent grudge against him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorcerer Bloodlines

* Arcane-you can't go wrong, good in almost any campaign, be a wizard without the upkeep
* Psychic-same as wizard, also just fun and different
* Protean- working on a Ganzi protean sorcerer for the future, pretty awesome
* Kobold- Kobolds and traps are great 
* Elemental- lots of choice, plenty of flavor, unlike other outsider based bloodlines doesn't have some alignment pegged to it 

&amp;#x200B;

Bloodrager

* Salamander- sure you loose movement speed at lvl 1 but you look awesome, getting a magic weapon in the middle of a fight is always a plus
* Vestige- just fits with bloodragers so well it might as well be the default pick
* Abyssal- so many stories can be made about controlling your demonic blood and not murdering your friends by mistake (its happened before)
* Hag- had a friend play a changeling hag bloodrager, awesome sidequest to save her from going full hag, I killed he Hag mom
* Destined- mostly the same reason as Vestige, its lower because iv never used it

&amp;#x200B;

Special note: the upcoming book  Heroes of Golarion seems to have a special focus with bloodlines, bring up medusa and sphinx bloodlines for Bloodragers and Phoenix or Sorcerers.  I have been waiting for a medusa bloodline for awhile, the other two are just icing for me.

I'm trying to use Shield Brace to use a two handed axe. Shield Brace specifically applies to using two handed polearms like a Nodachi.

Versatile Design: *A weapon with the versatile design modification is easier to wield for those skilled with other weapon groups. When versatile design is added to a weapon, choose a fighter weapon group. The modified weapon is considered to be a weapon of that weapon group (such as for the fighter’s weapon training class feature). A melee weapon cannot be considered part of a weapon group for ranged weapons, and vice versa.*

Nodachi weapon group: Polearm, Blades, Heavy

Butchering Axe: Axe

Would Versatile Design change it from Axe group to Polearm group for the purposes of applying Shield Brace?

Thanks in advance!

My players decided to enter a mysterious mansion which was inhabited by a very powerful and evil Lord. His name was the 10000 stats man (Mount and blade joke)  and died 647 years ago. The mansion is surrounded by a field that stops everything from entering it. Besides the magic field there are tall dark walls covered in blades so that scaling the walls is impossible. The gate to the mansion is not a normal gate but 10 blades that move back and forth and cut everything that tries to enter. They dig a tunnel and got inside. Even though it was day time the mansion's garden is in constant darkness and fog. Inside that garden there are living statues that cannot be destroyed and if they touch you they kill you. (The weeping angels from Dr. Who) You can stop them only by continuously looking at them. 

They get inside. Inside there are living armours that try to get one player inside them then turn him into a Graveknight. Once the armour is destroyed it releases a Will o' Whisp.  Their fight is hard and one player is nearly killed. Amongst living statues and living suits of armour there were normal and ""door mimics"", statues possessed by ghostly creatures and an ancient entity that has been guarding the mansion since the lord died. 

I think that a mansion covered in blades and eternal night with so many dangerous creatures is an obvious sign that the place has two gimmicks. 

1) Enemies are hidden from sight or are looking like objects. 

2)The mansion is lethal and death could come any time. In both the statues and living armour encounters one or more players were nearly killed. Added to the inherent danger of the monsters there is the ancient presence which is a modified Spectator adapted to work as a boss in pathfinder. 

Finally. The players arrive before a door that has ""DANGER"" written all over, literally. They still enter. The room is a large greenhouse inside the house. The trees are dead and what were once ponds turned to acid (because of the evil magic inside the mansion). What looks like puddles are actually deep basins but because of the darkness and colouration of the acid they cannot deduce how deep the puddles actually are. On the opposite side of the room there is a door with the word ""RUN"" written all over illuminated by a torch. 

The party has 3 spell casters,  a rogue and a barbarian.... 

Instead of sending the barbarian first the druid goes first followed by the shaman. They get to close to the acid pools and suddenly a six legged huge crocodile jumps out and grapples on of them into the acid pools. Surprisingly the druid manages to free himself and the shaman gets grappled instead...  The party started fighting and manages to kill the crocodile,  then they got jumped by a second crocodile and 3/4 characters are on death's door. The shaman died.


After this long explanation here's what my party (2/5 the rogue and the shaman whom left after his death) accuses me off. 

1) That I didn't give them enough signs that the place was dangerous. A door which reads ""danger"" in a mansion surrounded by blades and eternal darkness with creatures that you cannot kill and will snap your neck in a second with a 650 years old guardian that professes he is above the laws of the world (the spectator can communicate and watch over them because, he had 650 years to prepare himself for adventurers) weren't enough signs of danger... 


2) they didn't had any choice. In reality the mansion,  which they know how it's shaped, had two areas and they refused to search the first one trying to rush to the boss. The first area had many clues on what was inside the greenhouse and even a way to get up to the second floor where the boss is. They didn't wanted to explore it so why should I give them information they refused to search for? 

3) I should have balanced the encounter better. The monstrous crocodiles indeed did a lot of damage, mostly because they grappled the players into the acid. I knew that,  the players (were warned but say)  they didn't knew how dangerous they were. 

4) Accused me of targeting the mages on purpose instead of the barbarian. The druid and shaman rushed in front of him. I had the roll initiative when they entered the room. Those two had the highest score,  they went in first,  they got attacked. Literally I attacked the thing closest to the crocodile. 

5) I shouldn't have brought them there. Indeed, one could say I shouldn't have made such a dangerous place with such a hard encounter. I however placed a magical barrier around walls covered in blades to keep them out. Why didn't they ran away after the first or second near death encounter?  Let me be clear,  this whole area was optional. They saw a mansion on a Hill near the village they were staying into and decided to search it. The villagers knew nothing of that mansion and they were never capable of entering it. The players chose to continue,  what was I to do?  Tell them to get out? More that I did with the hints I dropped and the red flags I rised?  

I argued that they should have been more capable of discerning danger and should have left previously. I never made encounter that were so difficult before. They still pressed forward in an area obviously too dangerous. Even then, I couldn't have stopped the casters from moving forward into unknown danger first nor could I have stopped them from entering the room itself. 

In conclusion. What are your opinions on all of this?  Do you agree with them that I didn't gave enough info and I should have intervened?  Or do you agree with me that they should have realised how dangerous things were and be more careful? The shaman got so pissed he left because of this.

Alright. The first time I broached this subject, the time of reckoning was still distant and nebulous.

&amp;#x200B;

...Now, we're 19th level, Mythic Rank Four. And about halfway through this campaign. 

&amp;#x200B;

God help us.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my issue is, as it's always been with this game, that my character doesn't really have a clear-cut path.

&amp;#x200B;

The Magus, Samurai, and Rogue in our group will all likely end up taking levels in various archetypes of Fighter. The Samurai might go Kensai Magus, and there's wiggle room on the others, but, all three have builds that want Fighter Levels. The Monk's either going into Bloodrager or Barbarian.

&amp;#x200B;

...And, once again, there's me.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to Thalen's background, most of the casters don't make sense to take levels in; he specifically took up Alchemy because Wizardry couldn't heal the sick, and Clerics came with too many strings attached. Nevermind that the game itself has swayed his original course. 

&amp;#x200B;

Internal Alchemy has, in Pathfinder, strong Monastic leanings. However, a boon of the First World has left him Fey-shaped, leaving him a True Fey, serving as a sort of ambassador to the material plane, as well as the First World's resident Science Guy. (Because in a world where the laws of physics are relative, science is weird, and silly, and something the Fey would be interested in in a purely intellectual sense.)

&amp;#x200B;

Nevermind that the DM wants everyone in the party (me included) to have these soul-bound superartifact weapons. Which I'm at a loss on the creation of, in terms of both power and *form,* since Alchemists (especially Thalen) are more apt to blow you up than try to hit you with sticks. But, that's for another post.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, you have a bomb-slinging guru/doctor who distrusts the Gods, but might as well himself be a demigod (if i understand the lore of the First World right). No innate savant-like talents for the arcane, but studious enough for science, and now brimming with First World Powers.

&amp;#x200B;

...I mean, what? Druid? Ranger? Qinggong Monk? *Shifter*?

&amp;#x200B;

Where the hell do I even go with this, thematically?

&amp;#x200B;

  


...As a final thought? Yes. I \*could\* just keep leveling as an Alchemist. Or, grab the Master Chymist and Thuvian Alchemist PrCs. This increases the potency of my bombs, which is good. However, the advancing spell levels mean that I'd need to start learning ~~Metamagic~~ Metachemistry feats, or start using Spell Creation. Otherwise, those spell levels won't do much for me. Not to mention, the Thuvian Alchemist is just bad, and the Master Chymist has some pretty hard to swallow flavor. ...Also, I \*desperately\* need to reinforce my will save, and I can only stack magic items so far.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Character Builds may also be an appropriate tag?

&lt;p&gt;Personally, it looks to me like the intent was simply the ability to &amp;quot;designate certain foes,&amp;quot; which wouldn&amp;#39;t require a roll; you would simply say &amp;quot;Bane of That Scary Guy Over There&amp;quot; and apply whatever makes sense to the character at the time, but that&amp;#39;s more than likely wishful thinking from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take, for example, something like a Winter Wolf, that&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; an animal, or &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; a magical beast... Would one require a check to know for certain that it is, indeed, a magical beast, or is forcing a check like that more like a houseruled nerf to the Legacy Weapon ability?&lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance  

Two disgusting heads rise above this enormous mass of slime-drenched coils and slithering tentacles.


####CR   20
#####Alignment:  CE
#####Size:   Gargantuan
####Special Abilities  

Aura of Madness (Su) Any sane being within 60 feet of a conscious neothelid overlord must succeed at a DC 33 Will saving throw each round or become confused for 1 round. A creature that fails 5 saves in a row becomes permanently insane, as per the insanity spell. A neothelid overlord can suppress or activate this aura as a free action. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Coordinated Attacks (Ex) A neothelid overlord can make attacks with the three tongues in each of its two heads. It can attempt to swallow two targets at the same time, but if the neothelid overlord instead attacks the same target with all six tongues, it gains a +4 bonus on all combat maneuver checks to grab and swallow that target, regardless of how many tongues successfully hit. On a round in which it uses its breath weapon, a neothelid overlord can still attack with the three tongues belonging to its other head.

Divided Consciousness (Ex) The neothelid overlord’s two heads share a split consciousness that allows it to operate as though the overlord were constantly under the effect of a divide mindOA spell.

Trace Teleport (Ex) A neothelid overlord telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination of all creatures that use a teleport spell or effect within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to “seen casually.” This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This ability does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.

####Ecology  

Those who have learned secrets of the deepest vaults of Orv know of the neothelids of Denebrum. In fetid pools of poisonous swamps and surreal forests of twisted, phosphorescent fungi, these gigantic worm-things rule and wage war against Orv’s other denizens and each other. While most know that the neothelids are ancient creatures, spawned by eldritch beings in a time and place far removed from the known world, very few are aware that some neothelids are old beyond imagining. In their eons of existence, they have changed, surviving the centuries of mindless hunger that drives the youngest of their kind and ultimately defeating enough of their peers to become truly hideous masters of the damp, nearly lightless depths of Orv.

Scholars of such lore can only speculate as to what causes a neothelid to begin the transformation into an overlord. The change could be a natural process of age and development, though nothing about neothelids can truly be called natural. It may be that by delving into forbidden lore, they discover potent secrets, just as other rituals grant mortals the hideous power of lichdom. It might instead be that overlords’ ascendant power comes from some link to the blasphemous entities they venerate, a connection that only the most dedicated among the neothelids are able to cultivate. Whatever the cause, the result is terrifying—even maddening—to behold.

An overlord achieves such immense power and intellect that it reaches a state in which its consciousness splits into two minds that work as one. In a horrifying metamorphosis, the creature’s head splits down the middle to form two separate heads, each of which contains a portion of the neothelid’s intellect. The new neothelid overlord’s enhanced cognition grants it a deeper understanding of reality and enables it to harness psychic magic beyond the ken of its younger kin. Though still able to crush a victim with pure psychic force, the neothelid overlord develops an awesome level of finesse and skill in the manipulation of both mind and matter.

Neothelid overlords undergo other physical changes as well. Although they do not become significantly larger than typical neothelids, overlords take on a darker hue and their bodies sprout myriad tentacles that constantly squirm, as though each possessed a sentience of its own. The creatures’ tails also split into three parts, the ends of which claw and dig at the ground as though trying to take root in the very bedrock. The functions of overlords’ tentacles and triple tails are a mystery. It is possible that they have something to do with reproduction or the spawning of their seugathi (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 243) servants, but the truth is something that only the most insane researchers could hope to uncover. Along with these physical changes comes an increase in might and a swiftness that one would not expect from something so large. A typical neothelid overlord measures approximately 100 feet in length from head to tail, though it usually remains coiled and takes up about one-fifth of that space. Overlords weigh about 100,000 pounds, though individuals can vary wildly in size.

Neothelid overlords rise to become tyrannical rulers, directing less developed members of their race toward goals that no healthy mind can fathom. They reinforce their power over subordinates through manipulation and punitive displays of power, believing that fear of random-appearing punishments keeps their followers in line even when they are not under observation. Most assume that neothelid overlords serve either their own whims or those of the ones they worship—the shapeless and terrible entities of the Dark Tapestry that created neothelids and countless other horrors in the darkest reaches of space and time. Few who know of these monsters, though, dare to think that their purposes are anything but anathema to normal life whether aboveground or belowground.

In The Dream Diary of Lady Elliara Celmenari, written in 3875 ar, the Taldan author claims to have visited Denebrum while in an astral form and to have seen at least one neothelid overlord. Her writings depicts the creature as guarding the resting place of two dormant bholes (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 18). The text describes the overlord sending out madness-inducing offspring into the world to find a means of awakening and controlling the legendary beasts. Most learned folk attribute Lady Celmenari’s dreams of doom and destruction to a chronic nervous condition, compounded by the impending collapse of Taldan supremacy. But in recent years, rumors have come to light indicating that a certain cult of Groetus is working with agents of a mysterious and unwholesome nature toward a similar goal, which has dangerous implications for all of Golarion. To occult scholars, visions and whispers such as these serve as further evidence that terrible things wait in the dark places of the multiverse and must be opposed.

When we entered the cave we ended up drawing out every creature in the cave at once, including a trio of hags (who I later learned from my Magic Jar spell had 138hp each and several magic wands with spells like see invisibility, invisibility, scorching ray, and fireball spread out among them), a pair of stone giants, and a few hill giants. We had to make a second attempt on the cave and when we came back all of the monsters were invisible to us due to the wands the hags had. Our ranger is a beast at killing giants and did over 100hp worth of damage before killing the stone giant guard, which seems excessive from my memory of monster stats in Jade Regent at this level. Oh and I forgot that the undead ranger commander was shooting us several times a round for decent arrow damage and took over 100hp worth of damage himself before he finally fell.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Not I am not sure what is actually written in the AP, but I have a gut feeling that these monsters should not have been this tough. It took me possessing a hill giant via Magic Jar and collapsing the cave ceiling just to get us all out alive and away from them all, and we only managed to kill one hag and a couple giants.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Did my friend buff these up to ridiculous levels or am I just imagining things?

Edit: thanks to all. I still feel like things were far more difficult than they should have been but hopefully he’ll find a good balance as we move forward.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;I have a question for DMs out there who have ran or are running Rise of the Runelords.

After they got their attributes to lv 1 status they left the tent city and entered Phaendar proper. Here they went around to the shrine , trading company, oreld's shop, and the inn. At the shrine the group encountered a group from Last Wall on a pilgrimage to Phaendar to visit the holy site where Cayden drunkenly arm wrestled Torag. At the trading company the group saw 7 dwarves one of them was referred to as The Guildmaster. The Guildmaster gave Blondebeard a onyx shard and told her that tonight is the night and the next time they met it would be in Droskar's forge (I'll talk more about this later). At Oreld's shop they see Navah trying to convince Oreld to go back adventuring to Fangwood Keep. Then in the inn they come across a member of the Foxclaw scouts (one of the PCs is part of the Foxclaws).


So, as you can see I may have veered pretty far from the main plot. I changed the troglodyte caves to Droskar's Crucible and am using kobolds for that. The Guild serves as a union for craftsman in this region. In the Kobold King it mentions a theocratic empire devoted to Droskar. I thought the last vestiges of that empire are Kraggodan (although they are no longer worshipers of Droskar) and the Guild (which basically has the Crystalspire completely under its thumb). 


The Guild has an even bigger sphere of influence in the Darklands where they came into contact with Zanathura. Zanathura had built up a slew of morlock and kobold followers. The naga witch was absolutely enthralled with everything dwarf. So, the guild master told her about the Onyx Key and how to get it. Everything else is pretty much in line with the AP as far as this part is concerned. Zanathura gifted her kobold tribe to Ibzairiak to ensure the dragon would happily follow the general. I feel like these kobolds should be enemies of the kobold tribe the PCs encounter in Droskar's Crucible in a hope that my PCs will befriend this group and work with them.


I also mentioned Navah talking to Oreld. In my version Navah, Mayor Crawbert, Glintaxe, Oreld, and as of right now nameless elf rogue were all apart of the same adventuring group. As I understand it Navah researches transmutation on living creatures in an attempt to stay youthful. In her research she thinks something lies under Fangwood Keep and would like Oreld's help checking it out as the forces of Nirmathi just recently recaptured the fort. It's barely even an adventure, but Oreld refuses as he is happy in his small town.


Now what's in Fangwood Keep? By the time the adventurers can get to it (if they even do) it has been overtaken by the legion. So, Tessarael was a transmuter. Her arcane engine portal'd her away, but now the arcane engine serves as a prison for Argwyn. Which if they free Fangwood keep Argwyn will eventually become free as well while they are off trying to save Nirmathas. 


By the time the PC's stop Azaersi they will look up and find that Kraggodan, southern Nirmathas, and a vast majority of Molthune in their weakened state have come under the ""protection"" of the Guild (I'm thinking Trade Federation style from Star Wars). The Guild has now basically reforged Droskar's old empire. And they also have Argwyn and her rose blight taking over Chernasardo and challenging the Accressial Court.

I am new to Pathfinder, very soon starting my first game with my group, consisting of fellow Pathfinder newbies. As such, I still have a bit of a hard time finding a good build, something that is at least useful. As such, apologies if I'm going to ask some dumb questions here.  

So, for my first character, I want to play an Inquisitor, whom I first created with the help of several guides. He'd have a high Wisdom stat, as well as being of the Conversion Inquisition, so that he can be used as the face of the party. In general, I really like how versatile the class can be. The one thing I was not happy with, however, was my inquisitor's selection of melee weapons, since he is also supposed to be able to hold his own in combat. I did some research and found out that apparently, the Scimitar is a very good weapon, so I would like to use that.

While I know that an Inquisitor of Sarenrae would get proficiency with Scimitar's by default, this is unfortunately not an option for me. After years of playing a good-aligned group in another system, my group is eager to play an evil-aligned group for our first venture into Pathfinder, so my character is a Lawful Evil Devil-Spawn Inquisitor of Asmodeus. This leaves him with the Mace as his deities favoured weapon, which is apparently considered to be the opposite of a good weapon.

So, my current idea for a Scimitar-wielding Inquisitor of Asmodeus would be to give him the Heirloom Weapon trait, which grants him proficiency with the heirloom (Scimitar in this case). I also stumbled upon the Dervish Dance feat and I realized, this would mean I could make a Dex-based build, somewhat lessening the need to have high values in so many different attributes, as the only true dump stat I have right now is Charisma. For this, my idea was to have him start the game at Level 1 with the Heirloom Weapon trait for the Scimitar proficiency and the Weapon Finesse feat as a prerequisite, then to invest 2 points into Perform (Dance) at Level 2, so that I can pick Dervish Dance at Level 3. My idea would be to ignore Strength, since I'd use Dexterity for the Scimitar, leaving it somewhere around 10-12 points, while putting the then-free points into Dexterity.

For the record, the group wishes to play with the Epic Fantasy point buy, so my idea for starting attributes would be: Str 12/Dex 16/Con 13 (15 thanks to racial)/Int 12/ Wis 16 (18 thanks to racial)/Cha 8 (6 thanks to racial). 
Since I have never before created a character, I am naturally a bit hesitant, as I fear that my idea would ultimately result in a sub-par, poorly optimized character. I don't need a properly min/maxed character, but would still like to be somewhat useful. So, for this I have three questions:

1) Is the idea worth pursuing? Would it result in a character who can be decently useful in combat (of course not to the same degree as a Fighter or Barbarian), or is a Dex-based Dervish Dance Inquisitor a bad idea?

2) In such a Dex-based build, is Strength an outright dump stat on the same level as Charisma, or is it still something I should not ignore entirely, such as Intelligence? What use would I have for Strength in this build?

3) In case this is a decent concept, is the abovementioned attribute distribution fine that way, or is there anything I should change about it?

I hope you can help me out here and thank you in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there!

 Hi all

&amp;#x200B;

Currently the idea is for the quest is quite simple:

Players enter forest looking for elven tribe to try and recruit the Alchemist to return with them to the city (City currently has no alchemist).  Player enters the forest find very wild elves that have been Shaped by the diseased land (Elves change if they stay in a certain environment for long), I'm still not sure how I want them changed. The Elves will be living in the trees in where they have built a relatively small village but very impressive and beautiful. Anyhow Alchemist is one of the three elders of tribe ( or clan elves will probably be in clans?) , the elders refuse a to give a meeting to the players until they have proven their worth by  slaying a local Ettercap and his pet spider. \*Combat encounter\*  then meet elders and negotiation a deal with the Clan/tribe where the one Elder returns to city to become a Alchemist But the even clan/tribe become part of the princes domain.

&amp;#x200B;

So roughly that is the idea, I feel its all and all a bit bland... What can I do to spice it up? What would you do differently? Any fun encounters you would recommend, the Ettercap caps sounds fun but I could do some thing else? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

My party is going to be going up against a spirit of extreme cold. ( http://imgur.com/gallery/c6hUpIK )

It lives at the bottom of a huge crater which is surrounded by a cold Misty flame ( https://realmofadventure.fandom.com/wiki/Coldfire ) 

They are seeking it's heart, which is in it's physical corpse at the center of the crater and the spirit will be obviously attacking them to keep them away. 

The issue I'm having is coming up with an interesting battle/interesting mechanics. I don't want it to just be a damage sponge until it dies and I want it to be a serious fight. It will probably have multiple parts to the combat and lair actions. 

We play Pathfinder with some DND bits and Homebrew bits and my party are effectively level 15 (6 in party including 1 npc) and I have trouble really challenging them a lot if the time and I want this to be a really cool fight. 

I would really appreciate any ideas you guys can come up with.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing for years now, probably thousands of hours in aggregate, but in all that time I never once killed all members of the party. I've killed one or two here and there, maybe even all \*but\* one, but never all.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I ran a module that had a &gt;!Lurker in Light!&lt; and that changed in about an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure many of you have killed a party and probably even more have killed the stray player here and there. Regardless, if you've got any advice, I would appreciate it. The problem is, I want them to finish the module. It was really fun for them and the fight, even after they died, was apparently fun too. I would normally just suggest they retreat and revive their party member at their expense, but no one is alive to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

My two ideas are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mulligan the encounter, giving no extra considerations and fixing any rules that weren't followed precisely the first time. Giving them the foreknowledge of what they're dealing with is should give them the edge.
2. Make up a creative and engaging solution that masks my intent to give them a second chance by making it appear that I've done what the creature would have done, then allow them a second chance under those conditions (so long as they can reasonably find a solution).

Suggestions are welcome from anyone with input on my conundrum.

I'm looking for a rules-legal way to create a permanent, living, friendly copy of a creature that has all of the original's abilities.  I've looked into several things, none of which work exactly the way I want.

[Simulacrum](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/simulacrum/) has some potential, but also major limitations.  It's only half as powerful as the original, can't gain levels or experience, and can't be healed.

[Clone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/clone/) also looked promising, but I can't come up with any way for the clone and the original to be active at the same time.

https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bilocation/also does some of what I want, but it has an incredibly short duration and you aren't really two separate creatures.  More like one creature inhabiting two bodies.

The [Mirror of Opposition](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mirror-of-opposition/) probably comes as close as I can find to what I want to do.  It's an exact duplicate of the original with all the same powers, abilities, and items, and it's apparently permanent unless the original dies.  The downside being that it's hostile and attacks the original.  Any thoughts on getting around that?  Any way I can make it non-hostile if I can subdue it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running the Emerald Spire Superdungeon, and I've been having a lot of trouble with portraying Hellknights correctly. No outright spoilers in the post regarding the dungeon itself

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

Compared to Varisia in my RotR and the relatively easy culture to emulate there, I'm finding difficulty nailing down the Hellknights of Fort Inevitable. I've been reading up on them and their origins a lot over the past week, with Path of the Hellknight and bits and bobs I can find on wikis, but while I can understand their ideals and motivations to an extent, as well as their general attitudes and dispositions, when it comes to actually verbalizing it all I feel like I'm coming short. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very much the kind of person who needs to have knowledge to pull from myself, and I feel like I need something like an actual copy of the Measure and the Chain, or some semblance of one, in order to be able to portray them properly. So, with that in mind I'm probably going to end up writing up a very barebones version of it, the point being to have concrete definitions of the Law that I (and therefore my Hellknights) actually pull from in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done some searching online, and have been unable to locate anything of that nature myself, which is surprising to me, because Hellknights are badass and the Measure should totally be something every Hellknight has defined in their mind, to an extent.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, my query to you all is a bit specific at first, before opening up a bit: 

**General Questions**

Fort Inevitable is a Hellknight dominated and controlled town. I don't know too much about Cheliax, so I don't have any example to draw from making me ask, but would it make sense that the Hellknights stop and search all travelers into the town looking for illegal goods and contraband? In the book, it is stated that they question everyone entering and leaving the town, so I'm just wondering why they don't just go all out and pat down everyone like our airports.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, I think I've seen around that most Hellknights have the ability to read thoughts or discern lies; do they do this consistently to any citizens that might be recognized as suspicious, or save their abilities for something truly necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, what would the Hellknights stance on poison be? I had PCs enter the Fort last week with poison, and as I didn't quite have the time prior to session 1 to research all this, they were not searched, but they then asked me if poison is illegal out of character, and I just didn't know what to say, because in the book there's this: 

&gt;Sefurd is an unpleasant character with an oily, wheedling manner and an unhealthy interest in exotic toxins. He deals in potions, spell components, alchemical mixtures, and, of course, a wide array of poisons. Master Sefurd is disliked by most who know him, and his trade is regarded as suspicious by the Hellknights. Many people wonder why the lady commander hasn’t shut down his business and run him out of town. The answer is simple: Master Sefurd is Lady Commander Drovust’s informant on the Council of Prosperity.

&amp;#x200B;

This guy is allowed to openly sell poison to citizens because the Lady Commander is using him. Does this mean anyones allowed to just *have* poison? Or is it one of those things that's a trap, and if you buy it and are seen with it you're getting executed.

&amp;#x200B;

Which segues into the next question: What severity of a crime ends in an individuals execution, or forced slavery? I know Hellknights are Merciless, but I'm confused on just how how ""low"" of a crime will end in those things. 

Example 1: Stealing bread from a vendor. Execution, slavery, or a hand? Or?

Example 2: Making unauthorized additions to your floor plan. Execution, slavery, or? 

&amp;#x200B;

Based off everything I've read, it seems the hand is the least likely to happen, but I really do gotta wonder just how often they execute people. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Measure and How you Run Hellknights**

If you've made it this far, I imagine you know a thing or two about Hellknights, so even if you can't answer all the questions, I'd greatly appreciate some insight into how others portray Hellknights.

&amp;#x200B;

Are they very codexical in the way they summarize warnings and threats? 

Example 1: ""According to Article 564 subsection 54c of the Measure, making subterranean modifications to one's estate within city walls without consulting city planners is unlawful and punishable by \[death, slavery, lashings, etc\]. A trial will be held in accordance to Article 45 Section 1. You are to submit to arrest and come quietly with no resistance to be held in prison until the time of the trial, Article 3 Section 2a.""

Or do they just simply make statements on certain things?

Example 2: ""It is illegal to modify ones estates without first consulting a city planner. You are being put to trial for your crimes. Come quietly and do not resist, and perhaps your life will be spared.""

&amp;#x200B;

How do you imagine the Measure to be? What would you see in it?

My thought so far is that some more heals and melee would be a good addition to the party. I've been looking at Warpriest as he can do both of those things relatively well, a Divine Hunter Hunter, buffed pet for tanking and some cleric spells ain't bad, or an Infusion Alchemist to give the party some pots and wish them luck as I hurl bombs, or possibly mutate and charge into melee.

A charismatic necromancer that becomes the leader of a town after he convinces everyone to give his body after they die to help the people.

So every generation would be getting paid for making the next generation live better.

Im beginning to plan around this idea and how i can use it for plot and sidequests (a secret part of his necromancers planing to take over the town, some undead escapes control and begin to wander the roads, pharasma and sarenrae followers trying to destroy the city, etc).  
Of course the leader is going to need help from more necromancers to handle all the work (im thinking in a large town, so the poblation is around the 4000. The undead force of work would be between 500 and 750 zombies)

 The leader necromancer hast the best intentions. He doesnt want to control the world, he just wants that his town prosper and that people live happily under his reign.  
To live forever, he has a druid friend (a Reincarnated Druid, member of the party he were) that makes him reincarnate always and he has the inmortality discovery (per RAW that discovery just says that you dont get penalties for aging, but it doesnt say that you avoid dying from aging). 

 The undead have the order of not attacking the living. Of course there are safety procedures and security around them in case something goes wrong.  
The living usually dont do any work made by the undead (mining, farming, building) All that kind of work goes to the undead because they dont get tired).

&amp;#x200B;

I know, Necromacy is evil and all that by RAW, im not debating the alignment of the necromancer.

So, any idea, quirk, or sidequest that you would like to play or gm in a setting like this could help.

More specifically, I wanted to figure out the answer to the following question:

Given equal amount of Inspiration and a generic skill bonus granting resource (BGR), how large would the bonus have to be for the BGR to be more preferable than Inspiration.

To find that out, I devised the following experiment. I am using the Monte Carlo method to compare two functions:

\- First function simulates a series of skill checks by a character with access to Inspiration. Inspiration is only spent if there is more than 50% chance it will make a failed check succeed. The character does not have access to either amazing inspiration nor tenacious inspiration Investigator talents.

\- The second function simulates a series of skill checks by a character with access to a limited resource that provides them with a bonus to the roll. As there is no way to determine wheter the resource will be needed, it is always used when it is available.

Below are the results of the experiment. Each column coresponds to the DC that has to be beaten in order to pass the check (from 2 to 20). Each row coresponds to the amount of Inspiration/BGR at character’s disposal. Each cell shows the bonus at which BGR started giving better results than Inspiration (EDIT - if the value is 0, Inspiration always gave better results). The total number of skill checks each time was 100 000.

You may notice some artifacts, like the 19 in the „8000 Inspiration” row. These are most likely a result of either errors in code that I failed to find, or imperfections in the pseudorandom number generator.

The biggest conclusion here is that the size of the bonus at which BGR becomes worthwhile depends primarely on the amount of the resource you have available when compared to the number of checks that are important enough to consider using BGR in the first place. The DC does not affect the size of the bonus – instead, it influences wheter the BGR will surpass the Inspiration at all.

Generally speaking, based on those results, I think it is safe to say that Inspiration will be superior to BGR under all „naturally occuring” circumstances. Bonuses below +10 only become worthwile when you have enough BGR to cover 28% of all checks where you might consider using it. Of the top of my head, the only ability granting +10 to a skill check that I can think of is Natural Divination (though I’m sure there are others), which starts at a single use per day and tops of at six. So, nowhere near sufficient. More reasonable bonuses, like +5 and +4 only start being worthwile if you can cover more than half of the skill checks, which isn’t going to happen either – if you have access to this sort of abilities in the first place you are likely playing some sort of a skill monkey.

I have to say, these results surprised me. I expected Inspiration to be better overall, but I didn’t expect it to be this dominant. What do you guys think of these results? And do you see any major flaws in the experiment?

**TLDR:** I made an experiment to find out how big a bonus do you need to make bonus granting resource better than Inspiration.

&lt;p&gt;You may notice some artifacts, like the 19 in the „8000 Inspiration” row. These are most likely a result of either errors in code that I failed to find, or imperfections in the pseudorandom number generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest conclusion here is that the size of the bonus at which BGR becomes worthwhile depends primarely on the amount of the resource you have available when compared to the number of checks that are important enough to consider using BGR in the first place. The DC does not affect the size of the bonus – instead, it influences wheter the BGR will surpass the Inspiration at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, based on those results, I think it is safe to say that Inspiration will be superior to BGR under all „naturally occuring” circumstances. Bonuses below +10 only become worthwile when you have enough BGR to cover 28% of all checks where you might consider using it. Of the top of my head, the only ability granting +10 to a skill check that I can think of is Natural Divination (though I’m sure there are others), which starts at a single use per day and tops of at six. So, nowhere near sufficient. More reasonable bonuses, like +5 and +4 only start being worthwile if you can cover more than half of the skill checks, which isn’t going to happen either – if you have access to this sort of abilities in the first place you are likely playing some sort of a skill monkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, these results surprised me. I expected Inspiration to be better overall, but I didn’t expect it to be this dominant. What do you guys think of these results? And do you see any major flaws in the experiment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; I made an experiment to find out how big a bonus do you need to make bonus granting resource better than Inspiration. Conclusion – under &amp;quot;naturally occuring&amp;quot; circumstances Inspiration is always better.&lt;/p&gt;

Onto the questions:

&amp;#x200B;

 So, I'm making a monster for my character's backstory, and the antagonist of the backstory (the monster) is supposed to be a 'dark Unicorn' with twelve levels in Gunslinger. So I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question #1:** Unicorns are immune to poison, right? So does that mean they can't become Vamps?

**Question #2:** Can Unicorns be evil? And if so does that mean they lose their protection against evil and change it to a protection against good? If so, does that allow them to become a Vampire?

**Question #3:** Does a Unicorn's horn stop working if the Unicorn becomes evil (if that's even possible)?

&amp;#x200B;

 Thanks everyone, hope y'all can get back to me soon.

I think this seems like a perfectly reasonable thing for a particularly dedicated paladin to do; sure, they don't get to go hang out with their deity when they die, but isn't that what paladins are supposed to be all about, sacrificing themselves for the sake of others? and yes, becoming a lich is necromancy, which is generally considered evil, but that's because necromancy is usually done with other people's bodies/souls without their consent. I don't see how willingly practicing necromancy on yourself should necessarily be evil.

obviously, if I wanted to, I could just throw a lich template on a character, switch out evil for LG, and switch negative energy effects to positive energy, but is there any way, by RaW, to have a character like this, PC or NPC?

edit: a lot of people are saying that the process of becoming a lich inherently involves committing evil acts such as human sacrifice, but the [lich template](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/lich/), which ostensibly outlines the process, doesn't say anything about those kinds of acts being a necessity. it just says that you have to create a phylactery, which is a long and costly procedure, but not necessarily an inherently evil one (unless there's some other source detailing the process that I'm missing).

I'm on mobile so apologies for bad formatting.

I'm running a campaign in which one player's abandoned character is now a major villain under the BBEG. I had bern setting up a character storyline for him as he was amnesiac, but he decided he wanted to play a different character before it was concluded- so I took the ""evil choice"" ending for the character, had him betray the party after he had gone missing for a couple months of sessions, and revealed he was a former captain of the BBEG, now back in his position. The party will be running into him several times before the final showdown as they foil/fail to foil his machinations so I need to start figuring out how his encounters will work early.

At the time of his separation from the party, he was a 5th-level Inquisitor who used a boar spear as his main weapon. I don't remember his domain but that can shift now that he has turned. He is also a skeleton who disguises himself as a human, although the party and their important allies are aware of this. He also used evil-aligned divine spells secretly while in the party, notably Inflict Wounds. At the time this was so he could heal himself (as being undead meant standard healing would damage him) but his NPC form will br willing to use it more freely. He's also an asshole and makes liberal use of bone puns.

Lorewise, he's called the Voice of the Emperor, and he uses his authority under the Empire to make deals, blackmail people, and intimidate or influence people into doing what he wants. Abilities or feats that fit that theme would be great.

My problem is using the character base to make an actually challenging encounter without making it cheap difficulty. I'd also rathet not have to rely on adds/minions if possible.

The party is currently level 9 but will likely be 12-14 by the time they fight the guy for real. Even at level 9 I'm having trouble with creating good encounters because the players range from ""min-maxed into absurdity"" to ""I don't really know what I am doing."" Party is:

- Suli Invulnerable Rager Barbarian. Has stupid amounts of DR, elemetal DR, and health, and still hits hard. He's the min-maxer and is the primary cause if GM headaches as anything that actually hurts him does crazy damage to any other party member.
- Elf Fighter. Obsessed with tripping everything. Uses a Greatsword, has Spirit Weapon feat that lets him apply enchantments to his weapon every day.
- Strix Fighter 8/Sorcerer 1. Is training out of Sorc since the casters joined. Death From Above + Catfall boots. Previously skelly's player.
- Kitsune Ninja. Either does no damage or ridiculous damage. Squishy but can use Vanishing Trick.
- Catfolk Time Oracle. Has the Oracle feet that lets het move 10xlevel feet per day without triggering AoOs. Mostly healslaves.
- Elf Wizard. New player, terrified of dying so loaded up with defensive spells. Just realized they need more offense. Also may have become addicted to Enervate.

I'm worried about a few things:
1. Damage will do too much to everyone except the Barb who will take no damage.
2. So many PCs means NPC gets overwhelmed.
3. If NPC gets tripped it's practically over, but making him immune feels cheap.
4. Enervate. Just... I don't need to say anything more, do I?

So do you guys have any ideas for ways I can make him a threat without making players feel like they are tied? I.E. an antimagic field would prevent Enervate spam but would also make both the Oracle and the Wizard useless.

I'd prefer to use Inquisitor feats/traits/abilities if possible, but multiclassing also works. Magic/Wondrous items are also an option. I'm also open to Legendary Actions (I think they are called?) to counter the PC count. I'm already planning on greatly buffing his HP to make sure he lasts more than one round.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1E. I&amp;#39;m on mobile so apologies for bad formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m running a campaign in which one player&amp;#39;s abandoned character is now a major villain under the BBEG. I had bern setting up a character storyline for him as he was amnesiac, but he decided he wanted to play a different character before it was concluded- so I took the &amp;quot;evil choice&amp;quot; ending for the character, had him betray the party after he had gone missing for a couple months of sessions, and revealed he was a former captain of the BBEG, now back in his position. The party will be running into him several times before the final showdown as they foil/fail to foil his machinations so I need to start figuring out how his encounters will work early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of his separation from the party, he was a 5th-level Inquisitor who used a boar spear as his main weapon. I don&amp;#39;t remember his domain but that can shift now that he has turned. He is also a skeleton who disguises himself as a human, although the party and their important allies are aware of this. He also used evil-aligned divine spells secretly while in the party, notably Inflict Wounds. At the time this was so he could heal himself (as being undead meant standard healing would damage him) but his NPC form will br willing to use it more freely. He&amp;#39;s also an asshole and makes liberal use of bone puns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorewise, he&amp;#39;s called the Voice of the Emperor, and he uses his authority under the Empire to make deals, blackmail people, and intimidate or influence people into doing what he wants. Abilities or feats that fit that theme would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is using the character base to make an actually challenging encounter without making it cheap difficulty. I&amp;#39;d also rathet not have to rely on adds/minions if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party is currently level 9 but will likely be 12-14 by the time they fight the guy for real. Even at level 9 I&amp;#39;m having trouble with creating good encounters because the players range from &amp;quot;min-maxed into absurdity&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t really know what I am doing.&amp;quot; Party is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suli Invulnerable Rager Barbarian. Has stupid amounts of DR, elemetal DR, and health, and still hits hard. He&amp;#39;s the min-maxer and is the primary cause if GM headaches as anything that actually hurts him does crazy damage to any other party member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elf Fighter. Obsessed with tripping everything. Uses a Greatsword, has Spirit Weapon feat that lets him apply enchantments to his weapon every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strix Fighter 8/Sorcerer 1. Is training out of Sorc since the casters joined. Death From Above + Catfall boots. Previously skelly&amp;#39;s player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kitsune Ninja. Either does no damage or ridiculous damage. Squishy but can use Vanishing Trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catfolk Time Oracle. Has the Oracle feet that lets het move 10xlevel feet per day without triggering AoOs. Mostly healslaves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elf Wizard. New player, terrified of dying so loaded up with defensive spells. Just realized they need more offense. Also may have become addicted to Enervate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried about a few things:
1. Damage will do too much to everyone except the Barb who will take no damage.
2. So many PCs means NPC gets overwhelmed.
3. If NPC gets tripped it&amp;#39;s practically over, but making him immune feels cheap.
4. Enervate. Just... I don&amp;#39;t need to say anything more, do I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you guys have any ideas for ways I can make him a threat without making players feel like they are tied? I.E. an antimagic field would prevent Enervate spam but would also make both the Oracle and the Wizard useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d prefer to use Inquisitor feats/traits/abilities if possible, but multiclassing also works. Magic/Wondrous items are also an option.

I don't want to criticize anyone, I just want to understand and broaden my horizons.

So I've made several strong build myself too and I soon realized that min/maxing wasn't my thing. The feeling of dirt under my skin after playing the Knight with the pouncing dinosaur or the the barbarian with the max damage vital strike is something that I will never be able to wash off my skin. The worst part is that of those campaigns I remember nothing except some wacky anedocte. P.S. I know that martial builds can't even be properly addressed as OP.

Now, if I can see the beauty of theorycrafting strong builds, my experience has led me to not understand the need to bring those to the table. Instead I usually go the hypster way trying to make waky things work.

So that's the first question: when you do that, what leads you to bring overpowered stuff to the table?

The second question ties a bit with one of the possible answer of the first. Supposing that one reason to play an op build is to see how far you can push, to test the boundaries...

How do you want to be checked? Do you want to be stat-checked? By that I mean the scenario of facing stronger and stronger monsters ranking high in the CR department till the GM finds the numbers you can't beat.

Do you want to be outsmarted? ""I'm really curious to see what the GM will throw at me to test this build without simply recurring to high CR monsters"". That's another legit take: I can see players that would feel cheated if, simply because they are playing a strong character, they face only stronger monsters so that they don't feel strong at all because the GM is too lazy to think alternatives.

Are you fine with being unable to fight full strength all the time? That's another scenario, often used in many types of narrative. The hero has its power somehow limited and the big climax arrive when finally he can fight full strenght again smashing through that puny insects.

If you have min/maxed a specific mechanic are you fine with key enemies (or even many enemies) to be completely immune to it if there is legit reasons for it? Let's say you have made the fabled grapple build with the 2 turns coup de grace, with the giant druid archetype thingy. How would you react to the sudden spread of Freedom of Movement? 

My doubt is that obviously no player can win the arm wrestle with the GM right? But obviously that's not the point of the game. However when a particularly strong build presents to the table it begins a struggle of boundary checks to present the adequate challenge and it can go south quite fast.

So, when you bring the over powered build to the table what do you expect from your GM?

Pathfinder Reddit 2019

**Intro:** As recent discussion showed, that many GMs and players have issues with playing or allowing summons and summon-oriented characters. I try to collect all the different issues and offer some guides, ideas and solutions for them.  

**Assumption:** 

You are not an asshole and you don´t play with assholes. You play together to have fun and you all feel responsible for the fun of all other members in the group. Otherwise your problems start there, not with a particular class selection.  

There are two main prejudices, and unfortunately there is some truth to them. 

- *""Summons are too powerful""*
- *""Summons take too long to solve""* 

I would like to modify these two statements to what I believe reflects the truth a bit better: 

- **""They are too powerful for inexperienced GMs""**
- **""They take too long if you are not properly prepared""**

Fortunately both issues can be tackled. Let´s get to work.

**TOO SLOW!** 

A SM5 Dire Tiger can pounce, with that he has 5 attacks, each attack must be rolled, then each damage roll must be rolled, and then you need to check for the corresponding grab attack. Oh, you are level 13 and you have summoned 4 Dire Tigers, evolved them with an additional sting attack and hasted them? *That´s now 28 attacks?* That´s an awful lot. A SM7 Movanic Angel can provide you with Holy Aura, Aura of Protection, Detect Evil, Dispel Evil, Dispel Magic, Self-Invisibility, Cure Serious Wounds ... holy sh%t, whats the range of the Darkvision and what does the Vital Strike Feat do. I need the Bestiary 1-4 and the core book and then I need to look up X and Y and Z and ... *why exactly are you studying the pizza menu?* 

- **Use your Smartphone for Dice Apps** like *CritDice*. 

- **Use the fantastic** [**Master Summoner App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrazors.mastersummoner). An example of a large mass combat is [described here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/apemnp/new_app_from_the_creater_of_pathbuilder_master/egsuden/). I can only recommend it, especially the *""Roll all attacks / damage for all summons""* option. The above mentioned 28 attacks? A matter of seconds. Literally! It really is *that good* and the small token of appreciation is well invested, both for the developer and the group. It´s from the same guy who made Pathbuilder btw.

- **Average the damage dices!** It takes away some player agency and in average it makes Damage Resistance of enemies a bit stronger, but it speed things up considerably. *3 attacks hit? Great, that´s 3x 8 damage for a total of 24 damage*. 

- **Tell the players the Armor Class!** Many players can assume the AC of an enemy, from experience, knowledge or after the first 3 attacks, so it´s not exactly a state secret. While the others take their round, the summoner rolls his dices, and simply announces ""2 hits, 28 damage"" - end of round. 

- **Adjust what you summon!** Some players are new, inexperienced or simply overwhelmed by the complexity of the summoning class. Make sure that your player understands that many new mechanics are introduced with a SM spell. If he feels overwhelmed, simply ask him to reduce his summoning power to 1 or 2 different summons each level until he feels more comfortable with the more complex mechanics. 

- **Prepare your summons!**: write down the stats, look up what the special attacks, spells or abilities do, prepare the attack routine etc. *There is absolutely no excuse not to prepare your summons.*

- **Use color coded dices** to roll multiple attacks (and damage values) at the same time).

- **Concentrate only on a few types of summons!** Having 5 Dire Tigers is faster than having 2 Dire Tigers, one Tyrannosaurus, 1 Deva and 2 Mephits. 

- **Limit the summons!** If you are, for whatever reasons, not able to efficiently cope with multiple summons (which can happen for many good reasons: perhaps you are completely new to the system, before you prefer a far more ""rules light"" approach etc), do not hesitate to check with the player or the GM if limiting the amount of summons would be an idea. For example: a maximum of 1 offensive creature (because there will be the combat dice rolls), and 1 defensive creature (for Auras, Healing, Buffing., like the Shedu for example), which does not attack and stays in the background. 





**TOO POWERFUL!** *And then he summoned dozens of angels and demons, and they bombed everything away and he had like 20 different spells active at the same time and ... I do not know what to do"".*  You will find these kind of stories all over the net. IMHO the root of the issue is that many GMs feel a bit overwhelmed by the possibilities of what summons can do and the issues with preparing for them. And a single spell which can provide damage, healing, utility, travel, support or other surprises between each casting can be scary. But this is nothing a group cannot overcome.

- **Support your group!** While it may be tempting as a player to nuke the encounter and ignore the party, another approach can provide a better solution: use your summons to close gaps in your party setup! You have super-strong melees but you are lacking int the healing department? Some of your summons can reduce incoming damage by 50% and provides 18d6 of healing. There is no shame in supporting other players and characters and boost them directly (flanking) or indirectly (support abilities). Actually it can feel very rewarding. Try it out.

- **Enemies are allowed to run away!** Enemies do not have to act stupid when it comes to magic.  Magic is usually a long existing part of the world; and you as a GM can define that it is commonly know that magic (and with that summons) is a limited resource. Even your group of common highway bandits can act on that. *Retreat, delay, hide, attack later*. 

- **Protection from X level 1 spell!** Many summons, including animals summoned with the celestial/findish template, have an alignment different from True Neutral. A simply ""Protection from X"" can stop several different summons. **""This causes the *natural weapon* attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.""**. Sure, many summons later have weapons and some are True Neutral. But your Celestial Dire Tiger will be stopped - hard.

- **Terrain!** Speaking of the dreaded Pouncing Dire Tiger: a pounce is a charge and a charge cannot happen on difficult terrain. Nothing is stopping you as GM to sometimes define the terrain as non-ideal for combat. Perhaps it is in a heavily overgrown forest. Perhaps during a snow storm on a difficult mountain path. Perhaps it is the stately manor full of expensive art... [edit: someone told me that an FAQ allows long jumping (with an Acrobatics check] as part of the charge movement]

- **The case of the SWAT catsl** Summoned Animals are exactly that: animals. Even when they can use basic tactics as alpha predators, they are not exactly SWAT trained. Yes, they will happily attack the enemies the of the summoner. But perhaps not in the most ideal way. They can set of traps, eat attack of opportunities, go for the most obvious or nearest threat or use / not use special abilities at this most perfect moment. 

- **Avoid the 15 minute adventure day!** If your group knows that there will only be one battle or one critical situation to solve and the rest will be fun &amp; easy, every character with limited resources will be tempted to use all and everything in that critical moment, hence the dreaded 15 min nuke incident. Sometimes it can really feel good for the group to be super-powerful and to rofl-stomp over an enemy. Sometimes this is pure fun and that is perfectly fine. But only sometimes. Don´t fall into that trap and make it a habit with your players. Surprise them! Trap them! Expand their adventure day into the night! Give them the reason to delay their rest because X just happened and Y must be prevented in Z time! With that, the players and their characters will, over time, be more careful with their resources. They will *conserve magic powers* and not blow everything away for one battle. Which makes the actual battle easier for you as a GM to manage.

- **Variety is the spice of life!** Don´t fall into the habit of providing an endless stream of similar encounters in similar environments with similar conditions. If you always have a fight against some orcs in an open area, then yes, a Pouncing Dire Tiger is very strong. This does not have to be the case and you as a GM can provide many different locations, circumstances, (win)conditions and enemies.

- **Know the damn rules!** No really! Check them! The amount of *""Yeah, and then his summon teleported us away""* or *""Simply summon the Lantern Archon and have him cast Continual Light for some easy money""* or *""Yeah, summon the Djinn for 9 rounds, his Windwalk will be there for hours""* is too damn high. Sit together with your player, check out the summons he got for the new level, ask him if there are any special abilities who could be interesting and check the rules. The Djinns ability to *Create Wine* may be not that interesting, the Shedus ability to cast *Shield Other* may be very interesting (but for the latter you need platinum rings for the party members ...). 

- **Attack everyone in the party!** Magic exists! Magic is powerful! Magic is dangerous! Every intelligent and self-preserving enemy, from the lowest highway bandit to the demon-negotiating overlord knows that. They may attempt to derail the magic stuff happening. That can be something as easy as some hidden archers or cheap alchemist items. That can be a teleporting Babau Demon or a raging barbarian. Do not let the summoner (or casters in general) be perfectly safe by standing in the second row. Make your enemies action in line with their abilities, knowledge, resources, beliefs etc. **But never make them extra stupid**. 

- **Mass Effect!** Don´t fall for the trap to increase the power of the villain or the enemies beyond a reasonable amount *because there is a summoner boohoo*. The balance in PF does not work that way. Instead think about adding some lower level enemies. Reinforcements, snipers in ambush, a teleporting devil, a flying chimera etc. Due to the nature of the action economy this will provide a far better result in making the combat interesting and challenging.

- **The CR gap!** Usually the summons a player can call are of a lower CR than the party. With level 9 and SM5 you can summon a Babau Demon CR6. With level 17 and SM9 you can sumon an Astral Deva CR14. That usually means lower hit dices, AC, saves, spell / ability DCs etc. While the list may seem very impressive at first, the actual dice rolls may be far less impressive, especially on higher levels, when Spell Reistance play a more important role. *The Leonal Agathion can cast 10d6 Fireballs at will! But ... at Reflex DC 15. On Level 15 or 17. Which means that almost every enemy at that level will make the save and then often has fire resistance/immunity - combined with high hitpoints and spell resistance.*

- **Specific anti-summon spells!** There exist a number of specialized anti-summon / anti-magic spells out there, like *Anti-Magic-Field*, *Dispel Magic* (really!) or *Bite The Hand*. **Sometimes** a specialized Nemesis of the group may be absolutely appropriate.

- **Strength and weaknesses!** Monsters are powerful, but many of them have weaknesses. The Small Earth Elemental is very powerful for Level 3 to 5. But it has a speed of only 20 feet. The Dire Lion is very powerful when it can pounce ... but actually quite weak against Damage Resistance. The Hound Archon is a great allrounder for level 7. But a Reflex +5 save is actually not that great against spells which target reflexes. Check out the summons, their strength and weaknesses. 

- **Inbuilt optimization!** Many classes has incredible amounts of spells, feats, archetypes etc available. A player with high system mastery can make absurd builds with that. Or rather very average or even weak builds. But for a summoner? Even the most basic summon list contains usually 2-3 very strong choices for every spell level. And their feats are quite easy to find and are actually quite obvious. Augmented Summoning? Summon Good Monster? Versatile Summoning? Evolved Summons? You do not really need to be a master of optimization to recognize the power of feats, summon-oriented spells and monsters after reading through the list the first time. That means, as a GM, do not be afraid to ask your players to not overwhelm the other players when they choose mechanically weaker options. It is a general advice and in a group with mechanically vastly different power levels there will never be an ideal solution. 

- **The case of the the MAD &amp; SAD character** One large advantge of primary spellcasters is that they need *only one attribute to be excellent* in their role - everything is a bonus. Many other classes and specialisations however depend on *multiple high attributes*.The same goes for *magic items*. This is something you have to consider if you want to take a game in that direction: low attributes during character creation and low magic items *heavily* favors casters in power development / balance &amp; advancement.

**To make it clear**: as a GM you should not target the player for their choice of character (after all you have accepted it in the first place). But you can and should hold the player responsible for the fun of the entire group and that includes preparation and making sure that other players have fun as well. After all the normal tabletop RPG is not a PvP game, but a cooperative game. But I hope I was able to show some solutions to often mentioned issues with summoners, especially the Master Summoner. And maybe the next time you can allow these character types at your table, provided that the player is reasonable. Let the NCPs act as they are, from stupid, but frighteningly straightforward brutes to cunning manipulators, check the rules, as the devil is in the details, and use the above mentioned tricks to speed things up. 

*And yes, maybe that will perhaps lead to your characters charging the orc front lines while standing on burning ankylosauruses ...*

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more broken than summon spells in general imo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathfinder Reddit 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro:&lt;/strong&gt; As recent discussion showed, that many GMs and players have issues with playing or allowing summons and summon-oriented characters. I try to collect all the different issues and offer some guides, ideas and solutions for them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not an asshole and you don´t play with assholes. You play together to have fun and you all feel responsible for the fun of all other members in the group. Otherwise your problems start there, not with a particular class selection.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main prejudices, and unfortunately there is some truth to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Summons are too powerful&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Summons take too long to solve&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to modify these two statements to what I believe reflects the truth a bit better: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;They are too powerful for inexperienced GMs&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;They take too long if you are not properly prepared&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately both issues can be tackled. Let´s get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOO SLOW!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SM5 Dire Tiger can pounce, with that he has 5 attacks, each attack must be rolled, then each damage roll must be rolled, and then you need to check for the corresponding grab attack. Oh, you are level 13 and you have summoned 4 Dire Tigers, evolved them with an additional sting attack and hasted them? &lt;em&gt;That´s now 28 attacks?&lt;/em&gt; That´s an awful lot. A SM7 Movanic Angel can provide you with Holy Aura, Aura of Protection, Detect Evil, Dispel Evil, Dispel Magic, Self-Invisibility, Cure Serious Wounds ... holy sh%t, whats the range of the Darkvision and what does the Vital Strike Feat do. I need the Bestiary 1-4 and the core book and then I need to look up X and Y and Z and ... &lt;em&gt;why exactly are you studying the pizza menu?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your Smartphone for Dice Apps&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;em&gt;CritDice&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the fantastic&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrazors.mastersummoner""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Summoner App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. An example of a large mass combat is &lt;a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/apemnp/new_app_from_the_creater_of_pathbuilder_master/egsuden/""&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;. I can only recommend it, especially the &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Roll all attacks / damage for all summons&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; option. The above mentioned 28 attacks? A matter of seconds. Literally! It really is &lt;em&gt;that good&lt;/em&gt; and the small token of appreciation is well invested, both for the developer and the group. It´s from the same guy who made Pathbuilder btw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average the damage dices!&lt;/strong&gt; It takes away some player agency and in average it makes Damage Resistance of enemies a bit stronger, but it speed things up considerably. &lt;em&gt;3 attacks hit? Great, that´s 3x 8 damage for a total of 24 damage&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell the players the Armor Class!&lt;/strong&gt; Many players can assume the AC of an enemy, from experience, knowledge or after the first 3 attacks, so it´s not exactly a state secret. While the others take their round, the summoner rolls his dices, and simply announces &amp;quot;2 hits, 28 damage&amp;quot; - end of round. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust what you summon!&lt;/strong&gt; Some players are new, inexperienced or simply overwhelmed by the complexity of the summoning class. Make sure that your player understands that many new mechanics are introduced with a SM spell. If he feels overwhelmed, simply ask him to reduce his summoning power to 1 or 2 different summons each level until he feels more comfortable with the more complex mechanics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare your summons!&lt;/strong&gt;: write down the stats, look up what the special attacks, spells or abilities do, prepare the attack routine etc. &lt;em&gt;There is absolutely no excuse not to prepare your summons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use color coded dices&lt;/strong&gt; to roll multiple attacks (and damage values) at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentrate only on a few types of summons!&lt;/strong&gt; Having 5 Dire Tigers is faster than having 2 Dire Tigers, one Tyrannosaurus, 1 Deva and 2 Mephits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit the summons!&lt;/strong&gt; If you are, for whatever reasons, not able to efficiently cope with multiple summons (which can happen for many good reasons: perhaps you are completely new to the system, before you prefer a far more &amp;quot;rules light&amp;quot; approach etc), do not hesitate to check with the player or the GM if limiting the amount of summons would be an idea. For example: a maximum of 1 offensive creature (because there will be the combat dice rolls), and 1 defensive creature (for Auras, Healing, Buffing., like the Shedu for example), which does not attack and stays in the background. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOO POWERFUL!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And then he summoned dozens of angels and demons, and they bombed everything away and he had like 20 different spells active at the same time and ... I do not know what to do&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;  You will find these kind of stories all over the net. IMHO the root of the issue is that many GMs feel a bit overwhelmed by the possibilities of what summons can do and the issues with preparing for them. And a single spell which can provide damage, healing, utility, travel, support or other surprises between each casting can be scary. But this is nothing a group cannot overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support your group!&lt;/strong&gt; While it may be tempting as a player to nuke the encounter and ignore the party, another approach can provide a better solution: use your summons to close gaps in your party setup! You have super-strong melees but you are lacking int the healing department? Some of your summons can reduce incoming damage by 50% and provides 18d6 of healing. There is no shame in supporting other players and characters and boost them directly (flanking) or indirectly (support abilities). Actually it can feel very rewarding. Try it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enemies are allowed to run away!&lt;/strong&gt; Enemies do not have to act stupid when it comes to magic.  Magic is usually a long existing part of the world; and you as a GM can define that it is commonly know that magic (and with that summons) is a limited resource. Even your group of common highway bandits can act on that. &lt;em&gt;Retreat, delay, hide, attack later&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection from X level 1 spell!&lt;/strong&gt; Many summons, including animals summoned with the celestial/findish template, have an alignment different from True Neutral. A simply &amp;quot;Protection from X&amp;quot; can stop several different summons. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;This causes the &lt;em&gt;natural weapon&lt;/em&gt; attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, many summons later have weapons and some are True Neutral. But your Celestial Dire Tiger will be stopped - hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrain!&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of the dreaded Pouncing Dire Tiger: a pounce is a charge and a charge cannot happen on difficult terrain. Nothing is stopping you as GM to sometimes define the terrain as non-ideal for combat. Perhaps it is in a heavily overgrown forest. Perhaps during a snow storm on a difficult mountain path. Perhaps it is the stately manor full of expensive art... [edit: someone told me that an FAQ allows long jumping (with an Acrobatics check] as part of the charge movement]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The case of the SWAT catsl&lt;/strong&gt; Summoned Animals are exactly that: animals. Even when they can use basic tactics as alpha predators, they are not exactly SWAT trained. Yes, they will happily attack the enemies the of the summoner. But perhaps not in the most ideal way. They can set of traps, eat attack of opportunities, go for the most obvious or nearest threat or use / not use special abilities at this most perfect moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the 15 minute adventure day!&lt;/strong&gt; If your group knows that there will only be one battle or one critical situation to solve and the rest will be fun &amp;amp; easy, every character with limited resources will be tempted to use all and everything in that critical moment, hence the dreaded 15 min nuke incident. Sometimes it can really feel good for the group to be super-powerful and to rofl-stomp over an enemy. Sometimes this is pure fun and that is perfectly fine. But only sometimes. Don´t fall into that trap and make it a habit with your players. Surprise them! Trap them! Expand their adventure day into the night! Give them the reason to delay their rest because X just happened and Y must be prevented in Z time! With that, the players and their characters will, over time, be more careful with their resources. They will &lt;em&gt;conserve magic powers&lt;/em&gt; and not blow everything away for one battle. Which makes the actual battle easier for you as a GM to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variety is the spice of life!&lt;/strong&gt; Don´t fall into the habit of providing an endless stream of similar encounters in similar environments with similar conditions. If you always have a fight against some orcs in an open area, then yes, a Pouncing Dire Tiger is very strong. This does not have to be the case and you as a GM can provide many different locations, circumstances, (win)conditions and enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the damn rules!&lt;/strong&gt; No really! Check them! The amount of &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, and then his summon teleported us away&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Simply summon the Lantern Archon and have him cast Continual Light for some easy money&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, summon the Djinn for 9 rounds, his Windwalk will be there for hours&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; is too damn high. Sit together with your player, check out the summons he got for the new level, ask him if there are any special abilities who could be interesting and check the rules. The Djinns ability to &lt;em&gt;Create Wine&lt;/em&gt; may be not that interesting, the Shedus ability to cast &lt;em&gt;Shield Other&lt;/em&gt; may be very interesting (but for the latter you need platinum rings for the party members ...). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack everyone in the party!&lt;/strong&gt; Magic exists! Magic is powerful! Magic is dangerous! Every intelligent and self-preserving enemy, from the lowest highway bandit to the demon-negotiating overlord knows that. They may attempt to derail the magic stuff happening. That can be something as easy as some hidden archers or cheap alchemist items. That can be a teleporting Babau Demon or a raging barbarian. Do not let the summoner (or casters in general) be perfectly safe by standing in the second row. Make your enemies action in line with their abilities, knowledge, resources, beliefs etc. &lt;strong&gt;But never make them extra stupid&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass Effect!&lt;/strong&gt; Don´t fall for the trap to increase the power of the villain or the enemies beyond a reasonable amount &lt;em&gt;because there is a summoner boohoo&lt;/em&gt;. The balance in PF does not work that way. Instead think about adding some lower level enemies. Reinforcements, snipers in ambush, a teleporting devil, a flying chimera etc. Due to the nature of the action economy this will provide a far better result in making the combat interesting and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CR gap!&lt;/strong&gt; Usually the summons a player can call are of a lower CR than the party. With level 9 and SM5 you can summon a Babau Demon CR6. With level 17 and SM9 you can sumon an Astral Deva CR14. That usually means lower hit dices, AC, saves, spell / ability DCs etc. While the list may seem very impressive at first, the actual dice rolls may be far less impressive, especially on higher levels, when Spell Reistance play a more important role. &lt;em&gt;The Leonal Agathion can cast 10d6 Fireballs at will! But ... at Reflex DC 15. On Level 15 or 17. Which means that almost every enemy at that level will make the save and then often has fire resistance/immunity - combined with high hitpoints and spell resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific anti-summon spells!&lt;/strong&gt; There exist a number of specialized anti-summon / anti-magic spells out there, like &lt;em&gt;Anti-Magic-Field&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/em&gt; (really!) or &lt;em&gt;Bite The Hand&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes&lt;/strong&gt; a specialized Nemesis of the group may be absolutely appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength and weaknesses!&lt;/strong&gt; Monsters are powerful, but many of them have weaknesses. The Small Earth Elemental is very powerful for Level 3 to 5. But it has a speed of only 20 feet. The Dire Lion is very powerful when it can pounce ... but actually quite weak against Damage Resistance. The Hound Archon is a great allrounder for level 7. But a Reflex +5 save is actually not that great against spells which target reflexes. Check out the summons, their strength and weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inbuilt optimization!&lt;/strong&gt; Many classes has incredible amounts of spells, feats, archetypes etc available. A player with high system mastery can make absurd builds with that. Or rather very average or even weak builds. But for a summoner? Even the most basic summon list contains usually 2-3 very strong choices for every spell level. And their feats are quite easy to find and are actually quite obvious. Augmented Summoning? Summon Good Monster? Versatile Summoning? Evolved Summons? You do not really need to be a master of optimization to recognize the power of feats, summon-oriented spells and monsters after reading through the list the first time. That means, as a GM, do not be afraid to ask your players to not overwhelm the other players when they choose mechanically weaker options. It is a general advice and in a group with mechanically vastly different power levels there will never be an ideal solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The case of the the MAD &amp;amp; SAD character&lt;/strong&gt; One large advantge of primary spellcasters is that they need &lt;em&gt;only one attribute to be excellent&lt;/em&gt; in their role - everything is a bonus. Many other classes and specialisations however depend on &lt;em&gt;multiple high attributes&lt;/em&gt;.The same goes for &lt;em&gt;magic items&lt;/em&gt;. This is something you have to consider if you want to take a game in that direction: low attributes during character creation and low magic items &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; favors casters in power development / balance &amp;amp; advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make it clear&lt;/strong&gt;: as a GM you should not target the player for their choice of character (after all you have accepted it in the first place). But you can and should hold the player responsible for the fun of the entire group and that includes preparation and making sure that other players have fun as well. After all the normal tabletop RPG is not a PvP game, but a cooperative game. But I hope I was able to show some solutions to often mentioned issues with summoners, especially the Master Summoner. And maybe the next time you can allow these character types at your table, provided that the player is reasonable. Let the NCPs act as they are, from stupid, but frighteningly straightforward brutes to cunning manipulators, check the rules, as the devil is in the details, and use the above mentioned tricks to speed things up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yes, maybe that will perhaps lead to your characters charging the orc front lines while standing on burning ankylosauruses ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYL&lt;/p&gt;

I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible in regards of the RotRL plot.

So we left last time with a PC smacked to death by a mammoth in the most random way. They teleported back home then went to Magnimar and ,to cut fast the first hour of gameplay, they ressed him in the temple of Callistria with few roleplaying and much bitching. They have a Mesmerist with very high diplomacy (+29???) and the ability to take 20 once per day so it's really hard to deny things and not make it pass for straight cockblocking. But I didn't even care.

Then they made a plan for attacking the fortress again using some Divination. But they did not understand the my hints and dove directly in the secondary level. But that's fine. Except for the fact that the caster is quite noob and the other guys metagame practically everything except when there is to remember the existence of Invisibility Sphere. So I had to explain it to the caster because I felt bad for him.

Then they met an ally in the fortress which would explain them some plot and give directions to scout around this level of the dungeon. However as soon as they realized that she knwy where the boss was they read her mind seeing the closest place to the boss room and directly teleported there.

And again, till know I don't even care. Scry and strike is something I incentivize after a certain level.

So they ended up in this hallway with a magic door protected by a mirror that pops out guardians (I made it deliver 2 guardians at a time instead of 1). They went to investigate the door and I made them understand that a password would have been needed to pass the door. I even dropped an hint of where the password would have been. The only player that got the hint was playing the dumb samurai so no one listened to him.

Instead they decided to tear down the door. The first time 4 of them ended up blind. They fought and killed the guardians then went back to Magnimar to have their sight restored. Then they came back there and this time exploited the situation: they focussed the door, destroying it in one turn then killed the guardians once and for all. Now, the point is that they basically smashed their head trough a puzzle and I'm not sure if as a GM I should endorse it. They didn't solve it and instead overpowered it despite knowing the solution.

However they are quite strong and out of control and the only way to put them in check would be to completely deny them.

However my fear is that if players starts to get their favor thing always deny by effect like protection from good (for enchantment), dimensional anchor for teleports and freedom of movement for grapple I would just remove the frustration from me onto them. For example the door could just have been covered in a layer of force right? In this way it would have been much tougher.... However, idk, it doesn't feel particularly good.

I mean, as a GM I always like to outsmart my players instead of overpowering them.

An example: to counter a grapple abuser I prefer Grease to Freedom of Movement. A +10 to CMd moves far away the auto-success zone but let's the player use its signature skill. Freedom of Movement would remove all the fun.

TL:DR My players are good min/maxer, can overpower everything and in general are mechanically good at the game. I can't outsmart them anymore for skill and time reasons. Should I accept it and roll it trough or should I bruteforce back placing some tactical immunities?

Another way to see it is: as a player, if you have built a strong character do you want it to be able to smash almost everything or would you like the occasional/frequent real challenge even if it means that it doesn't follow the rules/it is cooked ad hoc with some specific math?

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your friendly burnt GM here and this week I come with a different perspective and a different me, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible in regards of the RotRL plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we left last time with a PC smacked to death by a mammoth in the most random way. They teleported back home then went to Magnimar and ,to cut fast the first hour of gameplay, they ressed him in the temple of Callistria with few roleplaying and much bitching. They have a Mesmerist with very high diplomacy (+29???) and the ability to take 20 once per day so it&amp;#39;s really hard to deny things and not make it pass for straight cockblocking. But I didn&amp;#39;t even care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they made a plan for attacking the fortress again using some Divination. But they did not understand the my hints and dove directly in the secondary level. But that&amp;#39;s fine. Except for the fact that the caster is quite noob and the other guys metagame practically everything except when there is to remember the existence of Invisibility Sphere. So I had to explain it to the caster because I felt bad for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they met an ally in the fortress which would explain them some plot and give directions to scout around this level of the dungeon.

Hello everyone,

A question came up during character creation for an upcoming game I’ll be running. We are using spheres of power system for the first time and one of the players has the enhancement sphere and the Physical enhancement talent with the intent on self-buffing. 

The issue cam up with the wording and use of the word \_\_always\_\_ in Spheres of Power. Lets look at the ability. 

As a standard action, you may enhance a creature or object within Close range for as long as you concentrate. You may \_\_always\_\_ spend a spell point to allow an enhancement to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.

Now the question becomes what kind of action is it to spend that spell point that you can \_\_“always”\_\_ spend. Initially I thought it would be done as part of the casting but he didn’t believe that to be the case. He intended to cast it as he entered a dungeon and then extend it later. 

Sure, but then I asked well what sort of action would that be? We assumed \_\_free\_\_… 

However, that presented an issue. In looking at a similar power from another sphere we found that it explicitly stated that spending the spell point was a \_\_free\_\_ action, something not stated under the enchantment sphere. Here is that entry from the war sphere for reference. 

As a standard action, you may place a totem. A totem is an effect on a 50 ft + 5 ft per 2 caster level radius area, centered on you, but does not move as you do. Creatures who leave this area lose the effects of your totem. You must concentrate to maintain a totem but may \_\_always\_\_ spend a spell point as a \_\_free\_\_ action to allow a totem to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration.

Now that wouldn’t be a real issue but then I found the enhancement sphere has some nasty debuffs associated with it. Were you able to spend the spell point later to extend the duration it would mean you could cast these debuffs at no cost with the intent of only spending a spell point when an opponent fails. 

That seemed a little strong for me and truly makes me unsure how the spell point is spent for enhancement… if anyone knows I’d love to hear from them, if they have a reference even better. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

So what should I do, take a second compatible archetype, or maybe Multiclass? We're level 5 now.

EDIT

I posted this pretty late at night and was so tired I forgot to actually explain what's wrong.

Well, it's mostly an issue in a lack of options. During Combat, I pretty much just spend the entire fight shooting with a crossbow (and missing) and outside combat my casting functions are still non-existent. Now This is probably due more to us being lower levels than the actual build, however, I worry that I won't actually be able to keep up. I made the character mostly for flavor but my inability to keep up is bothering me more than it should. 

In the end, I'm more looking to see how I can make the most out of my Unlettered Arcanist. I looked up some builds and guides and everything I found said Unlettered is terrible. So I'm feeling a need to salvage.

So I'm curious of what Witch Spells, Arcanist Exploits, and other options I should be looking at. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I recently started playing in a campaign and I made a Half-Elf Unlettered Arcanist, with the Bloodline Exploit (Astral Bloodline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I&amp;#39;m not happy. I made the character for flavor and weirdness but the gameplay has been less than ideal. My GM is willing to allow a bit of reworking depending on what I have in mind. So I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what I could do to make this more viable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should I do, take a second compatible archetype, or maybe Multiclass? We&amp;#39;re level 5 now. I was thinking of taking Twilight Sage, or Blood Arcanist. or maybe I&amp;#39;m just playing it wrong, maybe I&amp;#39;m just not picking the right spells, are there witch spells that are really good that I&amp;#39;m just skipping over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted this pretty late at night and was so tired I forgot to actually explain what&amp;#39;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#39;s mostly an issue in a lack of options. During Combat, I pretty much just spend the entire fight shooting with a crossbow (and missing) and outside combat my casting functions are still non-existent. Now This is probably due more to us being lower levels than the actual build, however, I worry that I won&amp;#39;t actually be able to keep up. I made the character mostly for flavor but my inability to keep up is bothering me more than it should. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I&amp;#39;m more looking to see how I can make the most out of my Unlettered Arcanist. I looked up some builds and guides and everything I found said Unlettered is terrible. So I&amp;#39;m feeling a need to salvage.&lt;/p&gt;

I think that to some extent I can accomplish this by creating a custom archetype for the Summoner, but I need a little help with making sure I balance just how long his eidolon can ""boost,"" and also just how much more powerful it should theoretically be when it's boosting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's what I'm thinking so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Duration: basing it off Rage, but since it's a more intense power-boost, make it shorter. I'm thinking ""A number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the Summoner's Charisma modifier + 1 additional round per 2 Summoner levels"".

&amp;#x200B;

For the main gimmick: the Eidolon has 2 forms, a ""normal"" form which is rolled up with stats as if the summoner were  lower-level than he actually is, and a ""boosted"" form, which uses stats that are higher-level than the summoner actually is. The summoner would keep both stat sheets around, and has to update both of them at each level up. I'm thinking at the moment that the gap will start to appear at 2nd level, where the Eidolon's abilities will lag behind by 1 level (meaning it'll still have Lv 1 eidolon stats), but he'll be able to ""boost"" the eidolon by 1 level (giving it 3rd-level stats), and then after that the ""gap"" will widen every 5 levels - meaning at Level 7 the eidolon will be delayed again (giving it Lv 5 stats normally) and it'll be able to boost up 2 levels (giving it Level 9 stats), at Level 12 it's growth will be delayed again (giving it Level 9 stats normally), and it'll be able to boost up 3 level (giving it Level 15 stats temporarily), etc, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also debating about having the gap go up every 4 levels, but I'm worried that might be too powerful.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Obviously, I haven't written this up in the normal Pathfinder vernacular, but hopefully it's still pretty clear what I'm going for. Is my math broken? Does it seem reasonably balanced enough for a single campaign use?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my players got inspired by a new anime that came out recently and wants to have a &amp;quot;Digimon-like&amp;quot; experience with his character - meaning not only that he wants to have a loyal intelligent supernatural companion monster-thing, but also that he wants to have the ability for it to &amp;quot;burst&amp;quot; with power - meaning he wants it to be relatively less powerful most of the time, and then have it transform into a much more powerful form for short periods of time.

* If a cleric can channel many times, that cleric may be obligated to spend much of combat channelling.  Maybe he wants to do other things.
* Sometimes I have a player who will channel a lot and I feel like I'm in a DPS vs HPS arms race to make challenging encounters. This only further locks the player into channelling every round.

**Pros**

* The cleric is effectively providing 2 rounds of healing, leaving them open to perform other actions.
* The number of channels is limited so the player has no choice but to perform non channel actions.

**Cons**

* Out of combat healing is decreased

I know 2e has been pretty controversial here, but I think Paizo has a real chance here to draw upon the wonderful things WotC has done with 5e, as well as pull from the best of Pathfinder 1e and combine it with some of the really cool elements they've tinkered with in Unchained and Starfinder. I'm excited to see what they ultimately include in their release, and I've been considering what specifics I'd like to see from each of those sources (or others!) in the core rulebook.

For example, one thing I'd like to see is a return to 1e form on Metamagic increasing spell level, but perhaps an innate class feat to Spellcasters that allows them to add a [A] Somatic Casting Action to a spell's casting to reduce its metamagic level increase by 1. A sorcerer could obviously do this on the fly, and a wizard could prepare a [Verbal] [Somatic] [Somatic] Magic Missile that shoots 2 darts (a la the Magic Missile spell) and goes an additional 30 feet with Reach Spell.

After running three sessions, it's incredibly clear that the party can face-roll whatever is sent their way by the pre-made adventure's book, and it isn't a matter of how tactically sound the creatures act (even uncharacteristically so, in the case of otherwise mindless creatures), or how many are sent (within reason, of course. A million CR 1/3 NPCs still can kill, but what's the fun in that?). 

The reach fighter is able to consistently hit and deal massive damage, would it be out of line to start replacing fighters and warriors with some M*aster of Many Styles* monks with snake style and a decent sense motive? Or Crane Style and Wing?

His AC is rather high (only lower than the kineticist at a respectable 17ish, if i had to guess off the top of my head), so he wouldn't be particularly endangered by this, he might get hit once or twice with coordinated NPCs that close in on him and go for flanking.

What about trying to throw in a lot of fear effects? Shaken on the party could be a good detriment, but I have a hard time keeping a medium, humanoid creature capable of both intimidate and reliable damage at such a low level (Fighter 1? Warrior 2?)

(my question is in 2 part) 

*First* : Between the Druid, wizard, psychic, sorcerer, witch, oracle, cleric, shaman and arcanist, with all their respectives archetypes and with the bloodlines, hexes, metamagic feat, etc. I can't seem to understand what role each caster fulfill. Coming from a video game background, I'm used to every class having a well defined role (tank, dps, crowd control, healer, etc) and pathfinder has me confused.

If anyone has rules of thumb for respective roles, I'd like to hear them. 

*Second* : As for my character, one of the caster I enjoyed playing the most was the frost mage in World of Warcraft (in the early day at least). While it was not the strongest/most popular caster in term of dps, fewer ennemies had resist/immunity against it and the slow from cold, freeze chances, increased crit on frozen ennemies, instant cast from brainfreeze and other utility were in my opinion a worthwhile tradeoff when compared to other specialization. 

While I don't care for the element of my pathfinder caster per se (could be cold or anything else), I'd like to have that kind of caster, with increased utility/survivability, the ability to steer the flow of battle with crowd control and debuff and the chance for burst damage if the conditions are right. Immunity/resist will depend on what our GM throw at us, but I'd tend to pick element that tend to be less commonly resisted. 

I'm not big on multiclassing (as I like to keep it simpler and generally like capstone), but I don't mind using archetypes or combining them when possible). 

With that said, what would be your suggestions and why? Thanks!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt; : Between the Druid, wizard, psychic, sorcerer, witch, oracle, cleric, shaman and arcanist, with all their respectives archetypes and with the bloodlines, hexes, metamagic feat, etc. I can&amp;#39;t seem to understand what role each caster fulfill. Coming from a video game background, I&amp;#39;m used to every class having a well defined role (tank, dps, crowd control, healer, etc) and pathfinder has me confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has rules of thumb for respective roles, I&amp;#39;d like to hear them. &lt;/p&gt;

Let's look at the first hour of last week, remember we are all level two at this point. We all knew we were being followed so I decided to do something. First I roll a fort check to wake up early without fatigue, I roll a 4 and add my +8 so that's fine at 12 o guess. Then I make a stealth check to disappear into the brush, I roll a 3 and add my +7 for a disappointing total of 10.  Next I have to scale a simply hill, it's only 20 ft. And a easy 40 degree angle, I roll a 5 and add my +4 for a total of 9, the gm gives it to me anyway since it's such an easy check but clearly I made alot of noise. Finally I make it to where I suspect our stalker is, expecting to find some tracks or maybe a sleeping bag I roll a perception, I roll a 1 and add my +6 for a whopping 7. I find nothing and head back to camp, I decide to use my BEST skill to get down and jump the incline and roll my acrobatics where I get to add +9 and roll a two! I landed without dmg but landed on my butt. 

I have tried different dice, I have tried other people's dice. I have tried playing more passively and more aggressively, I have even tried sitting in a different spot at the table. This character is just cursed. I have a +5 to accuracy and I still only hit touch AC about a third of the time. The gm and other players have gone past the point of joking about it to genuine sympathy. So what do y'all do? Have secret rituals or dice brands? Maybe I should reprint the character page, or maybe I should just grit my teeth and wait for my inevitable death since I seem to fail every combat save I attempt.

My friends and I started playing pathfinder a bit, we are gana do a cycling DM thing, and I am the first one up. I created a dungeon that everyone started in(kinda stolen idea from Legend of Grimrock-a pit for prisoners). 

When I made this dungeon, I made a few traps scattered throughout the dungeon, to add a bit of a challenge that none of the players have experienced before(we are newish).

I added a pitfall trap, in the intersection of a T hallway. I figured this would be dangerous, because it would have to be interacted with at least 3 times if not disabled or anything. I liked this, because it made it very dangerous(part of the hook for the dungeon).

 As a side note, we play on roll 20, and my players have a bad habit of moving their characters around without telling me anything, making things annoying/difficult to handle(it doesn't come from a bad place, its just excitement).

Of course, a player moves himself past this trap...but I am generous, and allow him to backtrack, and make a perception check-*he fails*- and then a reflex-*also fails*-, so he falls in*(normal trap stuff)*. 

Because of where I put it, they are forced to interact with it if they want to backtrack(of course, evil me made one of the choices of path a dead end, so they have to interact with it at least twice). But after interacting with it 2 times (easy 10ft jump/DC10 acro), they have been going through the whole dungeon making sure to check **EVERY** single door  and room. 

I understand they don't want to fall for a trap again if they can help it, and I am not upset or anything about this... Does anyone have a way they handle traps and perception checks for them all so that they don't have to explicitly explain all of this every time they go somewhere? It has slowed our game,  but I was wondering what I did wrong, and how I can fix it. 

I allow perception checks for traps, but I don't want to do that, everyone fail, and then think there's a trap and it influence how they do something, but when I try making random perception checks, they always get high and I feel like I cheat them when i say they don't hear anything, not to mention most of those times, when they aren't suspicious, they can tell it is a BS check, and I think I ruin the immersion with them...

She whipped her head back and forth in time to catch sight of someone at one of the windows, though she quickly regretted the motion.*

 *""Oh shit... shit shit shit SHIT!"" she yelled as the gnome scrambled to her feet. Running past her work table, she grabbed the long cylindrical mana capacitor and started running towards the other side of the room. After a good three or four steps, she stopped. ""SHIT!"" as she ran back to the workbench and retrieved her pistol.*

 *""She's trying to hide in a pile of scrap, we got her cornered boss!"" came the same voice from outside as she was indeed climbing up what looked like a large pile of rusted metal and broken wood and stone. Lifting a hatch, she dives inside and begins hooking cables onto the exterior cage around the glowing crystal capacitor.*

  *""Please work... please work... come on baby, please work!""*

 *Various gemstones and lenses of colored glass flicker weakly to life with momentarily light, accompanied with a rising whine of flywheels spinning up, only to then falter and die just as suddenly.*

 *""Oh... COME... ON!!!"" she yells, and starts kicking a panel off to her side. After a few good blows, the lights around her all spring back to life as illusionary displays and readouts pop into existence around her just as the door to the workroom bursts open with a shower of splinters.*

 *""She's in there boss, she's in... there?"" exclaims the weasely little man from before, his voice trailing off as the scrap pile starts to shift. Bits of lumber and lengths of pipe clatter to the floor as a... thing stands up from the heart of the pile. Standing a good 10 feet tall and made of rusted, pitted plates of steel bolted on top of wood and various other scavenged parts, it looks vaguely humanoid with an overly large torso, sans head, as it lifts two massive stone fists.*

  *""YES!"" comes a slightly distorted, metallic voice from somewhere inside the mishmash of parts. ""It worked, it actually works!"" Inside the contraption, Pym looks over the small figments representing her assailants and checks the readings. ""One of them is radiating a faint magical aura, that one is probably the leader"" she thinks as she pulls back hard on the leaver beside her.*

*The scrapper raises its arm and points directly at the boss, the metallic voice echoes out ""You just became my first test scenario!"" as it began its charge.*

Absolam, the City at the Center of the World, is the largest, most important city in the known world, just ask anyone who lives there! Founded by a once mortal god who pulled the Starstone from the sea, the ascension point of multiple other living gods, as well as the center of trade for the known world means there’s no end of wondrous things to see and do, which probably explains the relatively high numbers of gnomes who call the city home.

Like most gnomes, Pym’s upbringing was more communal than the standard human or elf’s, and while she can tell you who her parents were, she’d probably have to stop and think about it for a moment or two as it honestly just isn’t that important to her (or any other gnome, for that matter). She discovered her obsession fairly early when she was a fresh faced youth of not more than 30 in the form of machines. Simple clocks that performed marvelously precise movements, The Beast down at The Docks (a crane capable of spinning and lifting many tons of cargo as if it were nothing), and of course… The Clockwork Cathedral in the Merchant district.

By the time she was 40, after only a few years of distractions, she officially started attending formal classes at the Clockwork Cathedral and quickly absorbed everything she could. A bright, young up and comer, she spent as much time studying the Cathedral and it’s Thumpers as she did attending the actual classes being taught by the advanced students, but there’s only so much time one can spend in boring lectures, especially when going white before your time is a factor. By 43 she had learned everything the advanced students had to offer and finally she received her invitation to become an advanced student herself, first class was in two weeks. That is when everything changed.

To celebrate her admission to the upper ranks, her fellow cognates insisted on a night out on the town. A few drinks in reputable establishments turned into a few more drinks at less reputable establishments as the night wore on, and by the wee hours Pym found herself outside the Grogpit, one of the worst dive taverns in all of The Docks (but hey, the drinks are supposed to be dirt cheap, so it had that going for it). As she was about to enter, a large porter came staggering out the door backwards and directly into her. The man’s size said he must have been half ogre, but his face said he wasn’t pretty enough for an ogre. Whatever his questionable lineage, the impact knocked her on her backside several feet from where she had been previously standing. Seconds later, a half orc came out the door swinging at pretty boy, and it took everything Pym had just to dodge out from under their feet as the two exchanged blows.

Though she made it home in one piece that night, she was badly shaken. Not so much by the close call, but by the simple fact *neither of the brutes even realized she was there.* She could have been crushed entirely by accident. For the first time in her life, Pym felt small, weak, and helpless. And she didn’t like it. She was a city gnome, she never had military training, or combat lessons on how to fight someone bigger than she was, but she had her brains. One of the other cognates had been working on a weapon he obtained from an Alkenstar trader, a firearm they called it. A bit of convincing was all it took to let her examine it, the device seemed simple enough. An alchemical powder that exploded when lit, a metal casing to contain the blast which pushed the bullet out, and a trigger mechanism to kick the entire thing off. A few days later, she had a prototype. It didn’t look like the original, but it functioned, and it didn’t really matter if it was small, it packed a real kick!

But it still wasn’t enough. This might end a fight, but it wouldn’t prevent one. It wouldn’t stop her from getting stepped on by something bigger and meaner.  She’d need to be even bigger before anyone would really notice her. They say when the only tool you’ve got is a hammer, all your problems start looking like nails, and this was no exception. Pym was obsessed with engineering, clockwork mechanics, and building magical constructs. So, if she needed to be bigger and stronger, well then she’d just build a suit to make her bigger and stronger. Day after day, night after night she worked, losing all track of time. Her first day of class came and went without her noticing until one of the other cognates came to check up on her. She had missed her one chance; the Cathedral doesn’t let anyone that misses that first class come back and try again for a full year.

Without access to the advanced student workrooms and resources, there was no way she could build the fully magical golem shell she had designed. She tore the design sketches off the table and rolled out a new sheet of paper. Time to scale back the design. If she couldn’t use full on magical constructs, she could supplement it with clockwork pieces, or even simpler mechanisms if she had to. Whatever magical components she couldn’t craft or work around, well let’s just say she “borrowed” from the Clockwork Cathedral. After a few months of work, she had her first practical test build. Like the pistol, it was small, smaller than she wanted, but it worked! Mostly…

As a proof of concept, it was fine, but it needed a lot more work. And raw materials she no longer had, having burned through everything she could get her hands on already. Plus the Cathedral was getting wise to things going missing, security was increasingly almost daily, she wasn’t going to be able to get anything else there either. Here she was, in the biggest trading city on the planet, surrounded by everything she needed… but while she was an opportunist, she was no thief. At least not the kind that breaks into shops and robs innocent merchants, that is. What she needed was coin, and lots of it.

Welp, she could always get a job. Her suit would make her a pretty decent porter, but the pay wasn’t nearly enough for what she needed. Only two ways to make a lot of money quickly in a town like this involved the red silk district, or the gladiator pits. So, she took her pretty little face right down to the Crimson Coin and signed herself up for combat. What? She wasn’t desperate enough to sell HERSELF, but she was pretty sure she could knock a few heads with her prototype suit. That WAS what she designed it for, wasn’t it? It took a bit of convincing to get fat old Torman Iates to let her sign up for the Irorium. Not wanting to see “a tender young thing like yourself”, as he put it, get hurt, he said he’d make sure her opponent went easy on her, “just enough to knock some sense into you”.

100 to 1 odds were what the bookies were giving her, and even that was seen as being overly generous. She still put everything she had left on herself, suited up, and proceeded to slam her opponent into the wall to the amazement and then cheers of the entire crowd. Walking out with a fat purse of gold, it was time to go shopping for parts!

That cycle repeated itself for a while, though the odds increased substantially in her favor and Iates stopped pulling his punches with the opponents pretty quickly, she still managed to make enough money from the fights to fund her research and design. Bigger fights meant bigger purses, bigger purses provided the funding for better suits, and better suits allowed for bigger fights. Plus, she found that she quite enjoyed the fighting. And after every fight won came the victory parties, can’t forget the parties.

After several months of this she became fairly well known around the districts. If she wasn’t fighting for purse money, she was in her rented warehouse workshop bolting together whatever scraps she could find into her ultimate creation. If she wasn’t in her workshop, she was in the markets looking for parts. If not in the markets, she was at the docks seeing what the less savory types could “import” for her. And if not there, she was at the tavern getting toasted by her fans and congratulated for her latest win. Today? Today she was celebrating something special. Her biggest suit to date was almost complete, and she had just bought a bottle of good wine to mark the occasion. The last piece she needed was a suitable crystal she could use as a mana capacitor, and she was supposed to be meeting some Vudrani smugglers down at the port that night to obtain it. She didn’t quite have the money for it, but she was sure she’d figure out something. What was the worst that could happen?

Okay, finally got around to expanding on my favorite character, getting a promo image whipped up that includes a good picture for her mech, and the basic build information.

The important parts of the build (as in the non-obvious stuff) are that she's using the Rich Parents trait (reflavored as winnings) combined with the Master Tinker alternate Gnome racial and the Gunsmithing feat to not only let her start play with a Pistol without dipping into Gunslinger/Gun Chemist/etc and slowing progression on the main aspect of the build, but to give her proficiency with it as well.  Gunsmithing lets her craft guns, Master Tinker lets her be proficient in anything she personally crafts, and Rich Parents gives her the cash boost needed to afford the 500 gp crafting cost of a pistol with enough left over for other assorted gear.

The next several feats for her are Amateur Gunsmith, Craft Wondrous Item, and Catch Off-Guard.  That will give me the grit I need to quick clear jams with the pistol, and Catch Off-Guard will let me do things like grab whatever is handy to beat people with when the slams alone aren't enough.  Might even take Shikigami Style if I can fit it in with the crafting feats I'll need to take.

For the Eidolon, it gets to start at Medium which is nice.  Evolution route will be mostly size/damage/armor boosts.  I do plan on technically taking Extra Limbs and more Slams, but keeping them flavored as still being a biped with 2 arms and is just swinging them around more.  When it gets big enough, I'll take things like Trample, and see about getting a Permanent Enlarge on the Eidolon.

Gear wise, other than the obvious stuff like an Eidolon harness to help protect against Banish, I'll be making Wand Key Rings and flavoring them as basically a sabot or a converter so the mech can use attack wands as ""batteries"" for offensive ranged attacks (magic missile easily becomes a macross missile barrage, for example).

For Pym herself, I'm looking at armor being an Arachnid Harness (reflavored to mechanical legs instead of spider legs) and of course her pistol and wrench because hey, if I'm aiming at all the size increases I'm not going to fit in most dungeons, so gotta have some capability out of the mech too.

Side note, I converted to New Reddit to try and get text and picture at the same time, lets see if it works.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/41mo3c81lem21.jpg""&gt;https://i.redd.it/41mo3c81lem21.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pym rolled over groggily as the late morning sun shone through the high windows of her workhouse. The clattering of the empty wine bottle across the floor as she tried to raise her hand up to her pounding head sounded ten times louder than it had any right to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What the hell happened last night?&amp;quot;, she thought. &amp;quot;I remember... I finally conned a mana capacitor from those Vudrani smugglers, and I went to the tavern to celebrate... and...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Vudrani smugglers!&amp;quot;, she said out loud and suddenly sat bolt upright. The pounding wasn&amp;#39;t just in her head, someone was beating at the door as if meaning to knock it off the hinges. She whipped her head back and forth in time to catch sight of someone at one of the windows, though she quickly regretted the motion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s in there, I see her!&amp;quot; came the muffled yell from outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh shit... shit shit shit SHIT!&amp;quot; she yelled as the gnome scrambled to her feet. Running past her work table, she grabbed the long cylindrical mana capacitor and started running towards the other side of the room. After a good three or four steps, she stopped. &amp;quot;SHIT!&amp;quot; as she ran back to the workbench and retrieved her pistol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s trying to hide in a pile of scrap, we got her cornered boss!&amp;quot; came the same voice from outside as she was indeed climbing up what looked like a large pile of rusted metal and broken wood and stone. Lifting a hatch, she dives inside and begins hooking cables onto the exterior cage around the glowing crystal capacitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Please work... please work... come on baby, please work!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various gemstones and lenses of colored glass flicker weakly to life with momentarily light, accompanied with a rising whine of flywheels spinning up, only to then falter and die just as suddenly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh... COME... ON!!!&amp;quot; she yells, and starts kicking a panel off to her side.

We recently arrived at the Vault of Thorns, killed Ewigga, and are currently in the middle of battle with the giant dragonfly. Our characters are: a half-orc cleric, a Kitsune Shaman, a human warpriest, and Sylph ranger. 

Anyways, the start of the battle goes as follow:  the ranger hops on to a couple of giant lily pads, scouting out the area when the rest of the party is ambushed by the entangled spell on the platform. Soon the giant dragonfly attacks our ranger, thus starting initiative, the ranger passes his knowledge check and we get information about what it was (Fey), he delays his turn until the Shaman can try to talk to the dragonfly in Sylvan and see if they could spare its life. Unfortunately the Shaman fails her diplomacy and they begin to attack the creature. The rest of the round goes smoothly with the cleric beginning to cast enlarge person on himself to get out of entanglement, the ranger shooting at it and the war priest shooting as well. Everything is going smoothly right?

Wrong! The next round comes and the Shaman, hoping to not get entangled, decides to push her luck and jump onto the lily pad. She fails her acrobatics and falls 100 feet downward and onto the compost below, taking 11 non lethal damage and 25 lethal. Could have been a lot worst. Her next action? Heal herself. The dragonfly soon grapples the  ranger. The cleric is large, tries to step onto a lily pad, but since the cleric is basically a tin can, the lily pad gives and the cleric has to make an acrobatic check to grab onto the ledge, which he succeeds and begins to release his enlarge person spell.

Next round comes and the ranger orders his roc to attack, the Shaman begins summoning a small air elemental, the cleric is still hanging on the ledge, and the war priest is still shooting the dragonfly with his light crossbow.

Now comes the next round and an air elemental attacks the dragonfly, the ranger reversed the grapple on it with the help of his roc thus plummeting to the compost below, going unconscious but not dying, and the war priest helps the cleric up.

And the battle is still happening! Thought you fellas would like a good laugh and a wtf moment. This is by far the craziest battle I’ve ever been in in the six years I’ve played TTRPG.

So some backstory, I normally don't like secret rolls. Because I like player agency (even if the dice are still random). But the playtest really seemed to push the secret tag and so I gave it a try. One of the thing that struck me as less then optimal is how to do it. First thing of course was to write down each players modifier. Because asking for the specific skill or the whole sheet each time kind of gives a way the moment.

But still the rolling and then the time to look everything up also kind of gives it away. So rather than buying fluffy dice on a soft underground I was thinking of automatising this process.

So that is why I made this app. With the following features:

* Starts up with commonly used skills that have secret rolls
* Add/edit/delete skills yourself
* Save as many PCs as you want (add/edit/delete)
* Edit each PCs skills (name, proficiency rank, modifier)
* Pick a skill and get an overview for each PC rolled
* Reroll the whole party or individually
* Pick a target DC to generate an outcome (succes, critical success, failure, critical failure)
* Has a helper to pick a target DC based on table 10-2: Skill DCs by level and difficulty

Next steps are making a layout more suited for tablet, and maybe drag and drop to order stuff around. And obviously once PF2 drops make it up to date for that if needed.

Read more about it my [website](http://rekijan.nl/secretroller.php) where you can also  find my other apps or straight to the [Link to store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.rekijan.pathfindersecretroller.free).

As always I am open to feedback (though I have some serious time constraints :P ). And if you want to support leave a positive review in the play store. I will always strive to make my apps free but am looking into options to monetise, though sadly that is a bit tricky with android rules. But don't worry about that for now I just like making them for myself and sharing them with the community.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.rekijan.pathfindersecretroller.free""&gt;Link to store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance  

Grisly fetishes and the rags of once fine clothes hang off the corpse-thin frame of this horrifying, sharp-fanged crone.

####CR   9
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Disease (Su) Demon Fever: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 20; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage (target must save a 2nd time or 1 point of the damage is drain instead); cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Dream Haunting (Su) A night hag can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil targets by using a special periapt known as a heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once it does so, it rides on the victim’s back until dawn. The sleeper suffers tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions by confronting and defeating the night hag.

Heartstone (Su) All night hags carry a heartstone—a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt. A heartstone’s magic is fueled by the hag’s spirit and proximity—once separated from its owner (or upon the hag’s death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.

*****
####Ecology  

Terrifying murderesses and greedy soul brokers, night hags prey upon mortals while they’re most vulnerable. Preferring to kill their prey slowly, haunting their dreams night after night, these hags trap the tormented souls of their victims within dark gems so they might be sold in the infernal markets of the outer planes. Night hags vary widely in appearance, standing between 5-1/2 and 7 feet tall, and weighing from 150 to 300 pounds.
Customizing Hag Covens
Source Blood of the Coven
Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags—among the most powerful of mortal hags—relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag’s monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: animate dead, baleful polymorph, bestow curse, clairaudience/clairvoyance, commune, dream, forcecage, mind blank, reincarnate, speak with dead, veil, vision

The Night Hag adds the following spells to the coven: contagion, finger of death, major curse, maze, nightmare

The logline (or one-line) is the one or two sentence description of the movie, the ""What is it?"" that sums it up as best as possible while trying to entice you into wanting to know more.

The rules for making a good movie logline as he lays them out are:

1) Irony - The unexpected twist, the thing that makes you perk up and want to know more, the hook.  ""A cop comes to LA to visit his estranged wife and her office building is taken over by terrorists"" (Die Hard).  Because one doesn't expect a mundane office visit to end in a terrorist hostage situation.

2) A compelling mental picture.  It should be something that automatically has the reader filling in the blanks of where they expect the story to go.  It should also tell a timeframe and a location.  Up there with the Die Hard logline, it clearly gives you the mental outline of ""Okay, so the cop is going to have to fight the terrorists inside the office building, and probably win his wife back"", while telling you ""Oh, so most of it is going to take place in this office building, and its going to take place probably in a single day's time"".

3) Audience and cost.  This one is more for the movie pitch stuff, but it should give an idea of who the target audience is (is this a young adult comedy, old people western, etc) and an idea of how much its gonna cost (""cop fights terrorist in an office building"" is clearly cheaper to shoot as a concept than ""hotshot starship fighter pilot destroys an entire armada"").

4) A killer title.

So, thats for movies, how does this translate to a character concept?

Well, lets start with the basic idea.  A one or two sentence description of the character.  It needs to have some sort of interesting twist as to why anyone would care.  It should give a good image of roughly what to expect from the character (is this a melee fighter, is it a spellcaster?).  And, it should set the tone for the ""feel"" of the character (is this a lighthearted jokester, a cringy edgelord?).  And of course, what is their name?

The more I think about this, the more attractive it becomes as a way to solidify an initial concept.  As the author puts it, ""If you can't come up with a good logline that reels people in, you probably don't have that good of a story yet"".  As you work to get that ironic twist in there, it forces you to start thinking of overall plot dynamics and the challenges the character (movie) has to overcome.  After all, if the best quick description of your character is ""He's a fighter with a greatsword and power attack"" then you probably don't actually have a character concept, you just have a generic build.

So, stop and think about your character.  What would their logline be?  What is that one or two sentence pitch line that would make a GM go ""I want that in my game, tell me more""?

&amp;#x200B;

My DM is great. I'm not saying anything bad about him, or my group as a whole. But, as this first game has carried on, and my character (Thalen, Fey-templated Elven Internal Alchemist) has more and more proven himself the odd man out, I've realized something.

&amp;#x200B;

...He isn't anime enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that's an \*absurdist\* statement on its own, but, let me explain. Much of my group is invested fairly heavily into quite a few different media. From MMOs, to Anime, to vintage american cartoons, games both video and traditional, you name it, someone's into it.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to this game, however, there's a decidedly animesque bent to it. ...The whole thing being set in not!Japan should've been my first clue, but, hindsight's 20/20 and all that. It's also worth noting that not a single one of the characters in the party is, as far as I can tell, a direct copy of something. They're all original characters.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, you have a Mind Blade Magus, a Sword Saint Samurai, a Student of Stone Monk, a Sniper Rogue... ...And an Alchemist.

&amp;#x200B;

One of these things is not like the others.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a ""personality"" issue. Thalen's well-liked enough by the players that, if I overhauled his personality now, I'd probably catch flak for it. This is purely an issue of style, and combat tactics. How does one take an Alchemist who, thus far, has relied almost entirely on Bombs for combat, and smoothly move that over into something closer-quarters, more visually appealing?

&amp;#x200B;

What weapon would he use? Would he even \*use\* a weapon, given that Internal Alchemists are meant to multiclass Monk(and I guess Ninja/anything else with a Ki pool), and we're \*rapidly\* closing on Lv20 with no end in sight?

&amp;#x200B;

Ninja Edit: I have no idea if that's the right flair, but, it's what I'm using.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, being an idiot, Edit: Right. Playstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

As a combatant. Thalen will usually begin with his Grand Mutagen already in effect, pumping Dex, Con, and Str (in that order), and begin lobbing Bombs. He's not got quite the breadth of status that a normal Mad Bomber does, though. His go-to strat is to knock you prone with Force Bombs, then glue you to the ground with Entangling Bombs. Once thusly glued, you're effectively a non-threat, and he moves on to the next. If the above isn't possible, he falls back to elemental damage, and just goes full Nova to deal with you as quickly as possible. He usually carries a holdout weapon or two, in the event his bombs run dry... But, to-date, that's never happened.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess it&amp;#39;s time to drop the pretense, and ask what I *really* mean.&lt;/p&gt;

**Brutish Fighting:** not-Desmodu are naturally ambidextrous, and favor wielding two weapons.

**Enhanced Hearing:** not-Desmodu have exceptional hearing, nearly to the point of being able to navigate blind. They gain Blind-Fight as a bonus feat, and have a +2 racial bonus on hearing-based Perception checks, and on checks to locate an invisible opponent.

**Sonic Vulnerability:** As a consequence of their sensitive ears, not-Desmodu are particularly vulnerable to loud and disorienting sounds, taking a -4 penalty to saves against sonic spells and effects.

The party currently has a pseudo-dragon in the party that they're helping right now and it would be funny to have a near identical animal hatch from that big egg only to JUST. KEEP. GROWING. The party, with 3 naturey to 3 not nature people in it, would have both the animal handling and diplomacy checks to not get eaten. Plus, since they're level 8, an adolescent wyvern isn't a completely out of the question NPC ally OR fight, should they manage to anger it that much.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: To clarify on a few things, first of all the player is playing as a young elf. They have a LOT of years to care for this thing, and on top of that they have been caring for the egg quite well. They already have an animal companion, a tiger, which they split their soul in order to make live as long as they do (long story). The rest of the party wouldn't feel overshadowed or anything from it being something hecking sweet, as basically everyone in the party collects animals except our old monk, who instead if kinda the pet of an animal herself. Also, they kinda share their animals, so jealousy wouldn't be too big an issue.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;m applying the right flair, couldn&amp;#39;t decide between &amp;quot;Monster Talk&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;GM Talk&amp;quot;, but anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to GM a pathfinder group in my area with some people that are new to tabletops (they have only played 5E for less than a year, and are all new and self taught).  I myself used to play pathfinder for just under a year (with a group of experienced players). I really enjoyed the experience I had playing way back when, and always wanted more of it. Recently we started talking about playing tabletop together during the summer. I recommended pathfinder because that was what I had experience with, and they wanted something more substantial than 5E (which imo pathfinder provides), and I said I would GM (because I have always wanted to GM as well as play more). I'm fairly familiar with the mechanics of it, and easily can brush up on them myself before starting.

My questions to you guys are:

A) Is there any good resources that I could look over in being a good GM overall?

b) Resources for GMing in Pathfinder specifically?

c) Resources for helping in character creation (I had help for each of my... 5 character deaths in the campaign for making characters by the GM)

d) recommendations for a scenario or a 3 session campaign to give them a taste of pathfinder to see if they like it. Before I invest in a campaign book and see it sadly go to waste... It would also be nice to have premade, or semi-premade characters b/c of point C.

Also, if anyone could direct me to a discord or the like, where I could come in and ask specific questions about materials, rules, ideas, etc. as I undergo GMing school.

Regarding the Kineticist, I'm concerned about Burn and his immunity to Non Lethal Damage. As written, he shouldn't be able to accept burn to buff his powers at all, which is pretty shitty for him.

Should I say his immunity doesn't apply to his burn damage or let him accept burn without consequences?

I like the second option, because I'm hoping the undead traits will let them feel super powerful, just in time for me to bring them back to life for the final battle, but I am concerned he'll overshadow everyone else.

I've been in a game for about 6 months now, with my current arcanist character going for 4 months now. I built them around what the campaign had been, and I figured it was going to continue to be; more by-the-books, generic TTRPG goodness, what with the four combats per rest, dungeon-delving goodness that I feel like the average player craves - not ALL players, of course, but at the very least, me!

Since those four months of running my character, two six-hour sessions per week, we've had very, very few planned out combats. Two, to be precise; one against two beefy gnolls, which was designed more to let the martials shine, and one against a deathknight, which was... also designed more to let the martials (er, the paladin specifically) shine. I say ""planned"" combats to exclude the ""single wolf in a field"" random encounters, and the ""two animated objects"" encounters that happened 16 times in a hallway. Other than that, we've been doing almost a systemless RP; very little rolling, just talking to people and the occasional puzzle. And I get that some people like that kind of game; I'm just not one of them. It makes me feel like my character's useless and I'm not playing the game, even trying my hardest to interact with it.

The reason I've kept playing is the idea that, oh, maybe next session we'll finally encounter a combat, and I'll get to use x cool ability to do y cool thing! But I'm realizing now that this is probably (see: certainly) wishful thinking.

Problem is, the GM and I are really close, and I'm worried they'll take it personally if I choose to abandon the game. I've tried to make it clear that they're not ""failing"" me, and that it's their game, and me not being into that gameplay style isn't a ""fault"" of the game. Hell, I've even talked to them about making a character that would better fit the game; all I got was ""it's up to you and the party to decide if you want to roll a new character"", and ""I don't understand your current character's abilities even after being given their sheet so I can't help you.""

What do I do in a situation like this? I feel stuck in a weird mixture of social norms and gameplay that doesn't sit right with me. Am I expecting too much of a game, or is this situation way outside the norms of Pathfinder?

&amp;#x200B;

just a quick question. I am fooling around with a build for our upcoming campaign. I want to play a Alchemist(Vivisectionist) that does a 3 level dip into Unchained Rogue (Knife Fighter). The stacking of the sneak attack is pretty easy to figure out, or is it? The levels of both, Alchemist and Rogue, stack in this case to determine the number of sneak attack dice, this part is easy. But the Knife Fighter changes the d6 into a d8 when dealing damage with a knife or dagger and d4 for all other weapons. Is this true only for the 3 Rogue levels or does this extend to the sneak attack dice gained via my Alchemist levels, too? Would be much more convenient to deal +5d8 sneak attack damage instead of +1d8 and +4d6, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

And how does this interact with the bomber rogue talent? As I read it the bombs deal damage as the Rogues sneak attack, and as they are not in the least knife shaped, I would recon that they deal d4's in damage.

During character creation, the party's cleric came to me asking to play the [Ascetic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/archetypes/kobold-press/ascetic/) archetype since he wanted his cleric of Desna to be more of a free wanderer aesthetic. A quick glance immediately told me it was OP, so I got rid of its Bonus Feats and its Mind is Body ability since those abilities didn't trade out anything from the base cleric. Yeah, it has better skills all around but I let it slide since there isn't any Knowledge guys in the party anyways. The Wis to AC thing I just assumed would even out anyways since they can't wear armor.

Hoo boy was that a mistake. The party's level 6 now and the cleric's AC is staying within a stone's throw of the team's frontline without even trying, he has the best CMD, the best movement options, arguably the best skill loadout, and since he also Variant Multiclassed into Draconic Bloodline he'll be rocking some god-tier AC by the end of this campaign.

The rest of the party consists of a Warpriest, a Psychic Warrior, a Swashbuckler, and an archer Rogue. The Cleric seems content to stay on the backlines with his 10 Str but is noticeably more influential in battle than the others. Do y'all think I need to step in and nerf him, or could I probably get away with leaving the situation as-is? Pretty much all 9th level casters eventually outshine everything else anyways, but I want to make sure that everyone feels useful and challenged. Thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a new GM who&amp;#39;s running a custom campaign in the Eberron campaign setting. During character creation, the party&amp;#39;s cleric came to me asking to play the &lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/archetypes/kobold-press/ascetic/""&gt;Ascetic&lt;/a&gt; archetype since he wanted his cleric of Desna to be more of a free wanderer aesthetic. A quick glance immediately told me it was OP, so I got rid of its Bonus Feats and its Mind is Body ability since those abilities didn&amp;#39;t trade out anything from the base cleric. Yeah, it has better skills all around but I let it slide since there isn&amp;#39;t any Knowledge guys in the party anyways. The Wis to AC thing I just assumed would even out anyways since they can&amp;#39;t wear armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoo boy was that a mistake. The party&amp;#39;s level 6 now and the cleric&amp;#39;s AC is staying within a stone&amp;#39;s throw of the team&amp;#39;s frontline without even trying, he has the best CMD, the best movement options, arguably the best skill loadout, and since he also Variant Multiclassed into Draconic Bloodline he&amp;#39;ll be rocking some god-tier AC by the end of this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the party consists of a Warpriest, a Psychic Warrior, a Swashbuckler, and an archer Rogue. The Cleric seems content to stay on the backlines with his 10 Str but is noticeably more influential in battle than the others. Do y&amp;#39;all think I need to step in and nerf him, or could I probably get away with leaving the situation as-is? Pretty much all 9th level casters eventually outshine everything else anyways, but I want to make sure that everyone feels useful and challenged. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

So my boss/friend/old roommate wants to try his hand at Pathfinder with his new girlfriend. 

The task has fallen on to me to GM a one off for them. 

I was thinking of running a simple one off dungeon similar to Blackfang's from the beginner box since that's how I was introduced and I don't want the game to run more than one session, which usually happens when I try to run a PFS scenario, because people just spend to much time in towns and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

I originally thought the best way to do it was to just present them with some preset characters, but my buddy wants to build his own since to him one of the biggest appeals is Character creation.   
Character creation, for me personally, is also one of the biggest hurdles in the game. Because with all the extra material available, it can be extremely overwhelming to go through all the class choices, feats, traits and spells. Specially for someone new. 

I know a big issue with my Girlfriend playing the game is when she's creating a character, opens HeroLab and has literally 700 level 1 spells to choose from. Even worse with Traits. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought I'd start them off with just the CRB. But I also know that my friend usually likes to think up more weird characters. I asked him once and he said he would like to make a fire based sorcerer like a pyromaniac.   
So for now I gave him the CRB and the Advanced Players Guide (since it's the book that set Pathfinder aside from D&amp;D), and told him if he didn't find anything he liked to let me know and I would help him build a character that fit his ideas better.   


I'm also thinking of explaining as little of the rules to them as possible and using a more narrative approach of just them telling me what they want to do and me narrating what happens.   
Example ""as the Goblin moves rushes past you, you see an opening in his defenses. Giving you an opportunity to strike/""  
As opposed to ""He passed through your threatened area. You can do an attack of opportunity""

I'm relatively new to GM'ing (and tabletops as a whole) and have actively been playing for a couple of months now. We are currently in a narrative and combat heavy campaign à la Lord of the Rings. Our group consists of Me, Person A, B, C, and D. Person A and B have been playing for 5 and 10 years respectively while Person C and D started at the same time as me. Recently five sessions in Person B got bored of her Inquisitor and wanted to change her character so they left the party and she rerolled a new dreadnought barbarian. In session six Person A got his oracle character killed from recklessness and rerolled a new human brawler with kitsune heritage. Meanwhile C and D are still rolling with their Samurai and Ranger.

Here is where the question begins. Person B is using a half giant with a weapon that does 3d6 per swing. She now likes to brag about how she can do upwards of 40 dmg per swing. Person A can dish out 40 dmg as well with flurry of blows and had challenged the samurai to a duel only to one shot her entirely. Needless to say Person C and D are upset at these new characters and feel completely useless in comparison in combat situations, especially since the Samurai was supposed to be the muscle of the group before hand. They are no longer having fun now. Not only that but now I'm stressing out over what monsters I can take that aren't just push overs for A and B while also trying to not absolutely murder them by giving A and B a challenge. Plus with no healers anymore the team cannot handle the official monsters who can soak up more hits without being wiped out themselves.

Did I make a mistake by letting A and B choose what they did? Or are they taking advantage of my inexperience and naivety. Regardless, what can you advise to help the situation level out and how do I avoid situations like this in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The 3d6 weapon mentioned in the post is a large sized Earth Breaker hammer paired with the half giant utilizing powerful build. So she has this 3d6+6 damage with BAB allowing two attacks so that is a potential 48 with a perfect set of rolls. Plus things like cleave/greater cleave/power attack and the rage will come into effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: The team comp had a tank (samurai yojimbo), ranged dps (ranger), oracle (healer), and melee dps and utility (inquisitor). This is how they all agreed to start the campaign and it was balanced(ish) before.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3: The Brawler (was oracle) has a tendency to min max in any game we play (tabletop, video game, etc) and is hyper competitive. His oracle healed out the wazoo and basically made the team immortal, damage never stayed for more than a round on the whole party so I began to use stronger monsters that could dish out big numbers and some that did con damage. This meant more hp on the monster encounters and the oracle player began to complain that we were not killing enemies fast enough so he wanted damage and then his oracle drowned so he saw his chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 4: When talking to one they simply say that ""it's not their fault that person C and person D have built their characters wrong IE too weak by Person A and B's standards. When asked to tone it down they get upset and say ""why should I be punished for knowing how to play the game?

So she has this 3d6+6 damage with BAB allowing two attacks so that is a potential 48 with a perfect set of rolls. Plus things like cleave/greater cleave/power attack and the rage will come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: The team comp had a tank (samurai yojimbo), ranged dps (ranger), oracle (healer), and melee dps and utility (inquisitor). This is how they all agreed to start the campaign and it was balanced(ish) before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: The Brawler (was oracle) has a tendency to min max in any game we play (tabletop, video game, etc) and is hyper competitive. His oracle healed out the wazoo and basically made the team immortal, damage never stayed for more than a round on the whole party so I began to use stronger monsters that could dish out big numbers and some that did con damage. This meant more hp on the monster encounters and the oracle player began to complain that we were not killing enemies fast enough so he wanted damage and then his oracle drowned so he saw his chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: When talking to one they simply say that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not their fault that person C and person D have built their characters wrong IE too weak by Person A and B&amp;#39;s standards. When asked to tone it down they get upset and say &amp;quot;why should I be punished for knowing how to play the game? They have access to the same resources as me, so why am I punished?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;re starting at level 2 and I&amp;#39;ve taken Weapon Focus and Power Attack but I also took a story feat and Intimidating Prowess for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on I know a fighter can be good but I&amp;#39;ve never played one at high level and I worry about his viability at that point because I see threads all the time saying they&amp;#39;re bad past lvl 10 as characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything I can do in my build going forward to make myself useful at those later levels? &lt;/p&gt;

When you tell a friend about your new character, it’s one of the first things they ask; like the gender of a new baby.

But what if it’s holding us back?

“If you don’t know you villain well enough to explain why they’re the hero, you don’t know your villain well enough.” This anonymous quote about writing novels is just as pertinent to tabletop gaming, if not more so. No one thinks of themself as evil, in the way that we often seem to mean it. Even Demons don’t think of themself as ‘wrong’ or ‘bad,’ in an ethical sense. They just have *different motivations.*

Stated alignment is a crutch. It prevents players from really needing to think about why their character would take – or not take – a certain action. An example:

Once there was a character on a pirate ship who believed that the giant plant growing spikes through their vessel wanted a life sacrificed to let them pass. He held an unconscious pirate over the board of the ship, and then stopped. He stopped because he didn’t have a stated alignment, so he had to think. If he’d been ‘evil,’ he’d just have thrown her over. ‘Good’ and he wouldn’t have. But he was just a guy, in a weird and stressful situation, so he had to really think and feel into the action he was considering; just like someone would in real life. It wasn’t academic; this was a woman’s life, literally in his hands. The *lack* of alignment made it real for that player.

There is no alignment in our game. Instead, players spend some time really fleshing out what motivates their character. What do they believe, and what do they want? What prior experiences inform their decision-making process? Instead of just declaring that they act in a lawful fashion, players know *why* their character behaves that way, which allows them to better understand when they might *not* behave ""lawfully"". Basically, we create characters as subjective experiences of people, instead of objective representations of people. When confronted with a decision or situation, they can refer to these beliefs and desires to inform their actions. *Other* characters or players may think of a given character as good or evil, but the players/characters themselves do *not* think in these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've created a campaign and realized that it is almost an unintentional batman and Robin scenario.  setting up the meeting scene with only two pcs, one wants to be a rouge, the other a paladin. During a heist, Big Baddie has double crossed and killed Rouge's team and left him for dead; while on patrol, Paladin is held responsible by his order to return stolen relic of his god from BB. The motive would be team up and get revenge and relic back.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that I'm facing is, I've never had a Rouge character in any of my campaigns; although this would be a revenge/redemption mission, I'm not finding much use for the Rouge's skills.  He sneaks and will more than likely be acrobatic. The only Rouge character that I've had was me, and I did broken things as a rouge-wizard that would attempt to put people to sleep and sneak attack them for the kill.  I'm not sure how to approach a rouge that the player is all about stealing things, especially with the mismatched pair of a lawful paladin.

&amp;#x200B;

My only thoughts are to create scenarios where sneaking around to get to certain places of value would be the rouge's strength, but that's about it, haven't really been able to think of what else i can have the rouge do as his wants are to steal-to get money-to buy booze. Any missions that i could create that would involve stealing, would contradict the Paladin's wants of being Lawful Good.

&amp;#x200B;

I am running a one-shot tomorrow night and I have a story outline but could use some creative editing. Here is the outline I have for the story thus far:

1. Players are slaves on a boat. A bad storm begins to form and eventually creates an opportunity for the slaves to escape. Amidst the confusion, they find a way off the boat and into the water. They make their way to a nearby island. 
2. Landing on the island, the players explore and set up camp. Trying to find food and resources to survive. They are met by some  gigantic farm animals which they discover can talk (quite intelligently). These farm animals tell them they have escaped from a farm just north of there. The players learn the island is a giant farm run by giants! The giants use these farm animals to do all their labor for them. The farm animals are sick of it and need the adventure's help to escape. If they do so, the farm animals promise to get the adventures off the island and to safety. 
3. The adventures plan a way to break the animals free from this giants farm - hopefully without causing too much commotion. I imagine some sneaking, a bit of combat, some trickery. I'm thinking of maybe three scenes - a chicken coop, a pigs pen, and a cow pasture. 
4. Once the players finish their escape/rescue, they conclude by finding their way off the island (I haven't figured that out yet). 

  
I would appreciate any thoughts. Clever twists to the story. Perhaps help with the ending. Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all&lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance  

This humanoid salamander carries a gnarled staff in one hand. Tendrils drape its chin, resembling the beard of an eccentric hermit.

####CR   5
#####Alignment:  CN
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Suffocating Water (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause the water surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect—vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move—it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi’s Hit Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years.

Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards—another amphibious race often encountered in proximity to vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger—a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.

Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger—a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Environment:  any rivers or marshes&lt;/h6&gt;

I've introduced a metal called Anchorite, which prevents teleportation. It fills a lot of loopholes in the game around teleportation, i.e. why any wizard can't teleport into the king's bedroom and CDG him in his sleep. Manacles or other bindings made of Anchorite prevent the bound creature from teleporting, Anchorite curtains or rebar create walls which block teleportation. Obviously, the metal is semi precious (priced equal to mithral), but as levels went up, the cost was less significant.

My players are now level 16. They have more resources than they can count, and every other enemy is playing rocket tag (though I try to avoid it). However, they're stuck with a GM (me) who hates the fifteen-minute adventuring day, and forces them into multiple encounters in a single day. This frees me up to make more varied encounters, lets the martials shine, and forces the casters to use the depth and breadth of their power (not just top 2 spell levels). At their current high level, this means not only mundane preventative measures such as enemies at their escape or countdowns to failed tasks, but also magical means, such as Anchorite everywhere, AMFs, and straight-up dimensional anchors. 

My issue is two-fold:

1.  This not only creates an environment where players are more likely to meet their doom, or at least face more dire straights, it's also more difficult for them to retreat should things go south. What's a good way to balance preventing resting after every fight with not making every defeat a TPK?

2. Is this an unfair way to run encounters? This is more a sanity check. My players seem unable to comprehend that there may be more than 1 or 2 fights in their day, or rather unwilling to conserve resources. Using high level spells in encounters that are already under control, etc. Do you other GMs in high level campaigns simply allow the spells and days to flow like wine? How do your martials and other characters not as restricted to daily abilities keep up?

Currently I've got an apocalypse countdown with only a couple of days left, and my players seem rather ignorant of it when deciding to rest. So they're in the home stretch to stop it, which puts them in a heavily fortified mage's tower (with teleportation prevention to keep enemies out of the upper floors). They've pushed through an area leaving a large force behind them, and with 2 encounters and a boss fight to go, have burned through most of their spells (on lower level guards, etc. In the first 2 encounters). They shouldn't be able to escape, they shouldn't want to escape, but they're going to try. Ultimately, I'd rather them perish trying to stop the apocalypse than survive and fail, but that's not my call to make. I just hate the ""ding, times up. No rolls, here's what happens."" of the latter.

Also, I hope the tag works, since I'm on mobile I don't have a better way to tag.

I'm curious, I'm currently playing a Sylph Druid, (sky archetype) with a scythe main weapon. The story centres around a great hunt on the island, bringing animal trophies for points.

Due to the nature of the hunt, my character tries to steer the party towards killing only monstrous beasts, and has been trying to edge the party towards stopping other teams from destroying ecosystem/unnecessary slaughter, and offering healing skills to those who comply. 

For plot and reasons, I'm thinking of taking a dip in Slayer, I'm just looking for advice on what would be a good number of levels, or acceptable archetype for hunting primarily single target large enemy encounters (giant template dire boar), or groups of humanoids (other hunting parties).

Alignment is Neutral Good.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently playing my very first game of Pathfinder. For my first class I wanted to play a half-orc bard because I liked the idea of a big, massive, orc playing an instrument ect... However, after the first two sessions I am kinda taken aback on how the bard behaves. I had imagined my pc to be a bit more brawly and beeing able to do a bit more damage than i expected, especially spellwise.

Does anyone here have Tips on how to better play a bard? For this campaign I am in a party with a Ranger, a Barbarian and a Sorcerer. My stats are Str: 15, Dex: 14, Con: 12, Wis: 8, Int: 12 and Cha: 17. also i have also choosen the combat castig feat.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am really not that sure on how to play a bard properly any help would be apreciated.

Combined with [Irori](https://aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Irori) an unarmed character could get some incredible boons especially the Evangelist's Inevitable Fist which increases your effective size for attacks and the Sentinel's Secrets of the Enemy which grants a free +2 to Atk/Dmg against one enemy.

I am not sure if it is optimal but I do enjoy the flavor. [Sentinel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/sentinel/) has weaker benefits but maintains BAB progression and nets a free +1Atk/Dmg when dipping into the prestige class, although the 2 skill ranks hurts. 3 free casts of haste a day are fantastic though.

[Evangelist](https://aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Evangelist) is the one I am really looking into though. Good skill ranks, auto progression in a class of your choice, at the cost of d8 HD and lower BAB. In theory I could just dip 4 levels at the cost of -1 to BAB for 3 levels of progression in my main class. I would go all the way but I am missing out on BAB significantly already.

Finally there is [Divine Fighting Technique](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/divine-fighting-technique-combat/) which seems kinda interesting but not worth investing into for unarmed strikes. Most Unarmed damage comes from enchantment bonuses or from Str/Power Attack so I don't see the need for a free average roll on the die. I guess it is useful at higher levels when its a free 10 damage instead of a possible 2.

What are your thoughts? Are Deific Obedience and Divine Fighting Techniques worth it for an unarmed build?

Devin has, as usual, been his amazing self and kept up with more data entry while I've worked on changes to the site's front-end. We finally found a new place to rent a couple weeks ago and moved in 3 days ago, so all's well there now. I'm writing this post balancing the keyboard on my lap and using a TV on a bookshelf as my display, but the unpacking shall happen soon!

As for the changes, I'm happy to announce that some significant progress and long-needed updates are finally here. The main thing I wanted to talk about was the recent outages and the site's load times. I'm hoping you all have seen a significant improvement on the second part, as the outages were directly related to me finally becoming fed up with my old host and moving to a VPS (Virtual Private Server). While I originally intended this to provide more reliable uptime for the site and advanced notifications of maintenance, this had an unintended side effect.

For some time now I've struggled with the best way to deliver content to the users - I thought I had figured out the right way to do output caching of the pages in the last update, but my tests showed mixed results. Sometimes it seemed to work, other times it didn't trigger at all. I did figure out one mistake I'd been making when it came to a Parameter-specific field, but even with that change the caching was intermittent. Then, I moved the site. I still am unsure on the why, but once I was fully moved over to my lovely new Server VM, caching started working! I was skeptical at first, not sure on why it failed to work on shared hosting while working on the VPS, but after repeated testing from multiple computers/networks, it seems like I've finally gotten it fixed. In truth, all of you should have seen the changes already - for about a week now the site has been on the new VPS, and load times are better than ever.

Now, some of you probably have still seen some slowness here and there - to test things out, I set the code to only retain a cached copy of a specific page for 1 hour. The first time a page was loaded without an existing cache, speeds were as they were - alright someplaces, bad on others. For the next hour afterwards, however, users would get the cached version and the page would load in a few seconds. With this update, I'm increasing the cache limit to a full day, so as soon as anyone at all checks a page in a given day, for 24 hours after all should see quick speeds getting to that page. This is especially useful for many of the Spells pages, Feats, Wondrous Items, and other historically longer loading areas.

A lot of this is probably like a 5-year old gushing about how he figured out the multiplication table to a seasoned web developer, but for someone who ultimately programs as a hobby, this was extremely satisfying to finally get working. The last month has been a ball of chaos and stress, but today making this update I'm very happy where everything's landed. Thanks so much to all who emailed and commented with tips and suggestions!

Without further inducing of a TL;DR status, here's the updates!

###Community Assistance
I often get asked if people can assist the site in various ways, so we thought it might be useful to start including some requests from the community that the site could use assistance on. At the moment, that focus is the Rules content. Devin has crawled through many of the RPG product line books and added their rules to the website, but there are many mechanics and systems hidden throughout Adventure Paths, Campaign Setting books, and other product lines.

If you know of some mechanics/sub-systems that we could add (and don't have already - filter the Rules by Source to see if something's been covered) then please send us an email (feedback@aonprd.com)! We very much appreciate any assistance on this, there are a lot of books.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!

####Appearance  

This snake-bodied creature has five necks, each with a regal, humanoid face in a cobralike hood.

####CR   11
#####Alignment:  LN
#####Size:   Huge
####Special Abilities  

Change Shape (Su) A royal naga can use this ability to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male human, and so on) and the naga can only use this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its dual gaze in humanoid form.

Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the effects of either gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga’s five faces are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and often weigh more than 750 pounds.

Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals.

I thought to rely more on flavoring the combat that trying to knock each other to zero

&amp;#x200B;

So, due to my deep system mastery of Pathfinder, and my expertise in plumbing both AoN, d20pfsrd, and... ...Well, this place?

&amp;#x200B;

I've damn near become the co-DM of a game I'm playing. My current challenge is to design these soul-bound weapons, that're verging on Artifact-levels of power, or beyond.

&amp;#x200B;

The first two were easy. Our Samurai is getting a ""Mjolnir-Kanata"", which can do electrical shenanigans, and enables her to burn Resolve to pull off truly superhuman feats. Our Monk's getting a pair of Cestus which inherently increase his speed. Further, by staying in motion, and ""picking up speed"", he can build up to deliver huge, devastating blows. The amount of running around he has to do to ""spin up"" kinda telegraphs it, but, it's thematic, and it fits the DM's request for the weapon. ""Gloves that hit harder the faster you're going.""

&amp;#x200B;

And then... There's mine. Mine, and the Tiefling Magus'.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me get the easier one out of the way. The Magus'. The weapon, itself.

&amp;#x200B;

(Worth Noting: when I say ""weapon ability"", I'm talking as much about stuff like Corrosive Burst/Keen/Speed as I am Artifact Level Special Abilities.)

&amp;#x200B;

A ""vacuum-blade Katana"". As with the Cestus and Katana above, it's gonna have a slew of different powers. Which is something I'll need to do, myself. But, I don't even know how to begin rendering that, as a weapon. What powers are wind-based in Pathfidner,  that won't overlap with the Mjolnirtana?

&amp;#x200B;

Then, there's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the elements have made sense. The Samurai is quick to judge, swift to act, dealing devastating blows. Lightning. Our monk, besides being an Oread, is best known for (sometimes literally) barreling through challenges at breakneck speed. Thus, the weapon's themes of a ""rolling stone"". (It does Corrosive, because that's what Earth element is in Pathfinder.)

The Magus is a bit of a leap, but, given his all-consuming quest for vengeance, and the utter \*emptiness\* in him aside from that, a vacuum makes sense. A massive emptiness that only \*appears\* as wind, because it's sucking in everything to fill the void.

&amp;#x200B;

...My Alchemist, though...

&amp;#x200B;

I've been supposed both Fire, and Water, by the GM. My choice. But, I'm not sure how well those fit.

&amp;#x200B;

Thalen, thus far, has been characterized by his extreme snark in the face of peril, a calculating hands-off approach to battles, and the characteristic ""You never stopped to ask if you **should**"" mentality so common to Alchemists. There's almost nothing left, now, of the elf who began this journey. Above all else, though, was the pursuit of Infinity. Thalen's ultimate goal is to defeat Death Itself.

&amp;#x200B;

...I'm not even close to sure what ""elemental force"" could best represent that.

So far I have:

- 2 Monk - MoMS: for style merging and evasion

- 4 Unchained Rogue - Scout: for charge Sneak Attack

- 13 Brawler - Winding Path Renegade/Steel-Breaker: Movement speed/Swift -&gt; free 6 AC


My build is focused on unarmed strikes using weapon finesse and finesse training to get my Kitsune Brawler to have Dex to DMG. Pummeling style lets me charge and dish out sneak attack damage regularly which is 2d6 per hit.

She is working with high Dex and Wis and 5 Str since with her monk dip she gets Dex to AC.

With Monk's Robes I can max out damage for unarmed strikes and I can take GTWF as a perma or a flex feat, so I have 2 options for my last level that I am torn between. DM ruled that since Brawler levels count as monk levels, I effectively have unarmed damage of a Lvl 15 monk.


Oracle:

- Powerless Prophecy Curse: Uncanny Dodge immediately and improved uncanny dodge at 19th level, +4 to initiative at 9th level. 

- Cantrips and LVL 1 spells

Possible Revelations:

- Cinder Dance: 10ft Movement Bonus

- Dual Cursed Archetype - Misfortune: Free re-rolls once per day and forced re-rolls on others.

- War Sight/Temporal Celerity - Advantage on Initiative checks which works well with the curse.

Negatives:

- Not full BAB


Bloodrager(Urban):

- Bloodline Power(Undead) Frightful Charger: Cause shaken for 1 round when I charge while bloodraging

- Controlled Bloodrage: No AC penalty, no will save bonus, and a +4 morale bonus to one physical stat during a rage

- Fast Movement: 10ft movement bonus

- Full BAB

Negatives:

- No spells

- No Uncanny Dodge


So that is where I am at. I have a few thoughts as listed below:

- Take 3 U.Rogue, abandon the sneak attack charge plan, take 2 levels of Bloodrager or 1 Bloodrager/1 Oracle (Max BAB of 18/17 respectively)

- Take Oracle because my Con is 12-14 as I am focusing on Wis/Dex for AC so I wont be able to rage often.

- Take Bloodrager because the rage is just for very situational events and the +1 to attack is lovely.

- Abandon Scout URogue, take 4 URogue, 13 Brawler, 3 Monk (Movement does not stack with WPR unless I flex into it with Monk Moves) for Lvl to CMB and Still Mind but I feel this is at a loss since I only need a total of 15 Brawler/Monk levels. This would be an option if I don't use WPR.


Any thoughts? I have been mulling over this for quite a while and would love second opinions.

For the whole staggered on first round situation I would just total defense or set up my styles.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I am theory crafting a Brawler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Monk - MoMS: for style merging and evasion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Unchained Rogue - Scout: for charge Sneak Attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 Brawler - Winding Path Renegade/Steel-Breaker: Movement speed/Swift -&amp;gt; free 6 AC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My build is focused on unarmed strikes using weapon finesse and finesse training to get my Kitsune Brawler to have Dex to DMG. Pummeling style lets me charge and dish out sneak attack damage regularly which is 2d6 per hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is working with high Dex and Wis and 5 Str since with her monk dip she gets Dex to AC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Monk&amp;#39;s Robes I can max out damage for unarmed strikes and I can take GTWF as a perma or a flex feat, so I have 2 options for my last level that I am torn between. DM ruled that since Brawler levels count as monk levels, I effectively have unarmed damage of a Lvl 15 monk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerless Prophecy Curse: Uncanny Dodge immediately and improved uncanny dodge at 19th level, +4 to initiative at 9th level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cantrips and LVL 1 spells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible Revelations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinder Dance: 10ft Movement Bonus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual Cursed Archetype - Misfortune: Free re-rolls once per day and forced re-rolls on others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;War Sight/Temporal Celerity - Advantage on Initiative checks which works well with the curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not full BAB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloodrager(Urban):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodline Power(Undead) Frightful Charger: Cause shaken for 1 round when I charge while bloodraging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlled Bloodrage: No AC penalty, no will save bonus, and a +4 morale bonus to one physical stat during a rage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast Movement: 10ft movement bonus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full BAB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No spells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Uncanny Dodge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is where I am at. I have a few thoughts as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

So far, I've held pretty well to low-magic rules. Magic is a thing, but it's either small things or very rare. The group's encountered supernatural beings throughout, but it's magic on the same level as Indiana Jones rather than on the same level as Lord of the Rings or Skyrim like a regular campaign. 

So at the beginning of the campaign, I set forth some low magic rules. I audited the semi-magical classes I was allowing (like Druid) and nerfed some of their magic and gave them some other abilities to make up for it for balancing (like, druids don't maintain *Wild Shape* but they do get to use the *Wild Surge* ability from the Wilder class). At the beginning of the campaign when everyone was creating their characters, I told them don't plan on making a magical character unless you can give me a really good story reason for the character to be magical (ie. we have an alchemist who's basically a traveling snake oil salesman). 

So one of my PCs, the group's monk, recently left the group because his character ran out of motivation to continue the story and decided he wanted to retire (he was old anyways, and the player wanted to try out a different class). The player had already prepared a backup character, a rogue who specialized in breaking into places she didn't belong and fighting with a straightrazor (which is a really cool concept). The rogue also had an animal companion, a bulldog named Benji. This was a few weeks ago.

The rogue did just fine in the fight, but Benji wasn't much help and I think the player was disappointed by that. He's now asking me if he can take a level in the wizard class (which I had originally said was off limits) with a spell list that consists of spells I had approved for other classes (*Snowball, Summon Minor Monsters, Jump, Anticipate Peril, True Strike, Charm Person, Obscuring Mist*) in order to get access to Major Magic to gain access to making Benji a familiar at level 11 (which is coming up, we're level 9). On the one hand, this would make his dog much more durable in battle and much less likely to die. On the other hand, I already said wizard was off limits and having an additional combatant means I need to rescale my future combat encounters I have planned. 

Any advice as to what I should do? I'm considering making a trade and saying that Major Magic is no longer a requirement to make a familiar, but there's still the issue of combat scaling.

Of course, this will be sensitive to other cultures, but I'm hoping to respectfully base them around native american traditions. I have the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1) The party has a bit of an encounter with a patrol of warriors and fights a champion. This is going to both introduce them to the very different combat style of the Shoanti as well as convey to them that the clan is on high-alert -- an omen of things to come. It will also be a good chance for them to opt not to take lethal measures while they try to resolve the situation.  


2) the fight will be interrupted by a clan elder who demonstrates a close tie to his horse (speed in getting there) and a druidic connection to nature with a lightning strike in the distance to grab their attention.   


3) The clan elder will invite them as guests into the clan's camp. This will be a prime time for players to interact with different cultural aspects of the Shoanti day to day life, and aside from observing crafts, I could use some help with actual activities that the party can partake in.   


4) By dinner time, the clan will entertain them with music and stories, eventually alluding to a big bad that the party is looking to slay. I'd love to share stories with them, but short of having them trade one story for another, I can't think of a way to get the party involved outside of just talking at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) In the morning, the clan will conduct a ceremony to bless the PCs on their journey to slay the evil thing which has a long legacy of plaguing the Shoanti. This will be another opportunity to show a different flavor of magic.   


All of that, I expect, could take from 1 to two hours. I really need help filling out the time with role playing opportunities.

I recently started up a Legacy of Fire campaign, converted to the 1E Pathfinder rules. I have a very fun, quirky group and I figured that it would be an interesting experiment to start up a campaign journal and share it with the world, and I figured this would be the best place to post it. If you're curious about the conversions I'm using, they're mostly shamelessly stolen from the internet and while I won't be posting any links here to avoid spoiling things should my players come across this thread, I'm happy to send them to people privately. 

If you're familiar with Legacy of Fire, please refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments, as I have no doubt some of my players will read this and I'd like to surprise them. Note that any kind of familiarity with the adventure path is probably going to be helpful - I'm going to avoid explaining the entire game in detail where possible and just go over the main story beats and/or fun moments, so you might be lost if you've never played or run Legacy of Fire.

Now, without further ado, let's talk about my party!

**The PCs**

Kiril: A young human Oracle hailing from the city of Katapesh, Kiril is a mysterious man touched by the goddess of death, Pharasma, and as a result spirits seem to follow him wherever he goes. He's a Chaotic Good Oracle with the Haunted curse and the Ancestor mystery, as well as Finding Haleen, Reactionary and Fate's Favoured as his traits, plus the Lonely drawback.

Polly Bonne: An Elf paladin from the Nightstalls of Katapesh, Polly is an earnest young woman with a keen eye for a good bargain and a firm sense of justice and fairness. She's Lawful Good, with the Knight of Coins archetype and the Missionary and Dustwalker Agent traits. As you might have guessed, she's a devout worshiper of Abadar and aims to restore order and civilisation to the village of Kelmarane.

Sheisho: An enigmatic Vishkanya vigilante of mysterious origin, Sheisho is quiet and inscrutable much of the time. She's (seemingly) Lawful Neutral, with the Serial Killer archetype and the poisonous slayer and desert child traits. Due to both her heritage and profession, she is an expert in the use of poisons and with her blades is able to use that expertise to deadly effect.

Amun'Setra: A cold, grizzled ranger from a dark, mysterious tribe located somewhere in the south of Osirion, Amun is a hard, dangerous man with a talent for killing and the ability to slip into most areas undedected. He's Neutral Evil, worships Set and has the Divine Tracker and Skirmisher Archetypes, as well as the Gnoll Killer and Bloodthirsty traits and although he seems to be human, there is a certain cold, unnatural aura about him. 

Thanna: A strong, beautiful Orc mesmerist who recently escaped captivity at the hands of her mercenary masters, Thanna is adept at using her wiles and her mystical abilities to get out of danger and has joined the expedition to Kelmarane primarily to earn her freedom, so that she can never be sent back to her masters. She's Chaotic Neutral, with the autohypnotist and dreamstalker archetypes and with the Charming, Earning Your Freedom and Tusked traits, plus Insatiable as a drawback.

Additionally, a sixth person was hired by the patrons of the party, but due to a night of heavy drinking this mysterious individual missed the camel caravan the rest of the party took to reach them. (Translation: One of my players was busy and couldn't make the first session.)

**The Session Begins**

The PCs had all been hired individually prior to the start of the campaign by Garavel, the major-domo of the merchant princess Almah, to help them retake the ruined village of Kelmarane from the tribe of gnolls that had occupied it. The adventure path itself is pretty vague about the circumstances around this hiring and how/why Garavel decided to hire the PCs and then piss off to his camp without them, but I figured it was a case of him meeting a bunch of applicants of varying quality/integrity a few weeks prior to the expedition and telling the ones who didn't seem *completely* insane where to find him (note that anybody signing up to participate in an expedition to retake a village from a tribe of gnolls in the service of the Carrion King is probably a *little* insane). 

Now, the session began with the party riding through the hills on a camel caravan as they neared Garavel's camp at the Sultan's Claw, this huge-ass tree shaped like a claw. As they topped the last rise and saw his camp, they saw that one of the wagons in the camp was on fire and that the fire was spreading to the Sultan's Claw itself. The PCs immediately sprung into action as Almah, the leader of the expedition, requested their help and then raced off to try and put out the fire. Sheisho, Kiril and Thanna went to try putting out the fire, while Polly spent the entire encounter struggling to pull another wagon away from the one that was on fire and Amun similarly spent most of the time failing to stabilise a dying mercenary. Fortunately, the players were highly efficient in putting out the fire, with Sheisho deciding it was the best idea in the world to try dual-wielding buckets. And it worked. The fire was extinguished before it could spread and after a few rounds of Amun consistently failing his heal checks to stabilise the mercenary, Thanna took a break from yeeting water at the fire to help. With the combined efforts of Amun, Thanna and the camp's priest, they saved the mercenary. Oh also there were a bunch of animals running amok that had been freed from their pens somehow and while the module called for handle animal checks to round them up, Thanna's player said words to the effect of ""lol no"" and used the slumber hex to put the various goats and chickens to sleep.

With the fire put out and the animals in their pens, Almah and Garavel took the PCs aside. Almah explained that she suspected arson and, as the PCs weren't present when the fire started (and thus couldn't have set it), they would be tasked with investigating. She left them with Garavel, who (after some prodding) admitted that he suspected the camp's resident tracker and gnoll expert, Dashki, was responsible. Then, Garavel followed after Almah to the command tent and the PCs were let loose to explore the camp and interview its residents. 

Amun, Kiril and Sheisho traveled to the immolated wagon to investigate it, while Thanna and Polly decided to first interview the caravan drivers. As the former group examined the burnt out wagon, they noticed a greasy, disheveled looking man watching them from behind a rock. They called out to him and he walked off in a hurry, prompting them to follow and call out again. Thanna and Polly were distracted from the caravan drivers and rejoined the rest of the party, cornering this man and asking him his name. When they realised it was Dashki, they swiftly accused him of having set the fire. He denied any involvement in the fire, to which Thanna responded with the spell Implant Urge, implanting within Dashki the urge to be honest. He continued to profess his innocence, admitting that he was spying on Almah when the fire was set and claiming that pugwampis were probably responsible for the fire. Amun returned to the wagon to investigate, discovering tiny tracks around it. Then, he went to the animal pen and found similar tracks, which lent some credibility to Dashki's claims. Polly, deciding to mess with the tracker a little (and also trying to discourage further spying), declared Dashki a pervert and then flipped a coin, declaring that if it landed as heads then she would believe Dashki. Once the other players and I stopped referencing The Dark Knight and No Country for Old Men, Polly did so and while it came up with tails, she just narrowed her eyes and said ""I believe you for now."" After a quick discussion with the caravan drivers in which they learned that the prized goat of the husband had gone missing in the chaos, they returned to Almah and Garavel to report their findings.

With a new suspect in the setting of the fire, Almah ordered the PCs to follow the tracks with Dashki and, if possible, bring back the pugwampi. And so they followed the tracks, noticing signs that a small animal had been dragged away from the pens. Before traveling any distance, Thanna made sure to cast prestidigation on Dashki to clean him off and make his stench bearable, after which they got moving. As they went, they cast light spells to illuminate the dark path as the sun set, noticing freaky shadows and hearing sounds in the distance as they passed by increasingly frequent cacti. Eventually they heard the bleating of a goat as they came to the edge of a dense thicket of cacti, so thick that they would need to move carefully to avoid being pricked. As they arrived, I explained how they felt a sense of dread and impending doom, and that they could see an injured goat tied up on the other side of the thicket by a shallow ravine. With a job to be done right in front of them, Kiril, Amun and Sheisho rolled up their sleeves and started to wade through the cacti, making periodic acrobatics checks as they went. As they made their first checks, with the most shit-eating grin you will ever see I asked them to roll twice and pick the lower results. When we came to Thanna and Polly (whose players had experiences with pugwampis in previous games), they just nope'd right the fuck out of it, standing still at the edge of the thicket with Dashki, watching as the other three tripped, stumbled and cursed their way through the thicket. Once they had made it through minus a few hit points each, they approached the goat, who promptly freaked the fuck out. Since he was tied off at the edge of a ravine, with a huge cactus jutting out from the wall just below him, this was pretty dangerous. So Thanna just pointed at the goat and put it to sleep, allowing Kiril to untie it with ease. As he did so, an outraged pugwampi emerged from behind a rock in the cactus thicket and started shooting pathetic tiny arrows at the PCs. Kiril and Sheisho ran into the thicket and after tripping a few times while the other party members proved completely ineffectual at engaging it from a distance, they managed to kill the gremlin.

With the goat and the dead pugwampi, the PCs returned to camp and presented the corpse to Almah and Garavel. With the mystery solved and Dashki's name cleared, the gnoll expert claimed the dead pugwampi as a trophy and hung it from his walking staff. With that, Almah sat the PCs down to discuss the terms of their employment - she offered them 200 gold apiece for their part in retaking the village of Kelmarane. The players happily accepted this sum, at which point Almah ordered them to go and clear out the nearby abandoned monastery to serve as a new base of operations, seeing as how the Sultan's Claw was too exposed. The players agreed and the following morning set off.

Once they reached the monastery, they decided that they would clear it out room by room rather than heading straight for the main chapel right away. Thus, they swept through the rooms swiftly - they killed four pugwampis in the kitchen, then battled with five baboons and a pair of wandering pugwampis before finding themselves in the dormitories of the monastery. In the neighbouring tower, Amun gazed up and noticed something furry poking out from a nook in the wall high up. His immediate reaction was to try shooting it, as is reasonable.  Unfortunately he missed and wrecked his arrow. Then, Kiril attempted to move the furry thing with Mage Hand, but to no avail as it was too big. So Thanna attempted to use her Slumber ability on whatever it was. It failed. With that, Amun picked up a rock and threw it as hard as he could against the wall next to the nook. That seemed to catch the furry thing's attention, as it immediately retreated further into the nook, disappearing from sight. The players decided it was probably nothing and went down the nearby stairs to explore the crypts below the monastery.

They emerged in a large laboratory and spread out to search the place. Kiril and Polly approached a pair of dirty glass containers filled with a luminescent green liquid crusted with mold. Kiril noticed it was quivering a little. Then it attacked them. The rest of the party raced in to help them pretty quickly and destroyed the oozes in short order, but not before one of them managed to scratch Polly up a little. At first this didn't seem like a big deal, but after they finished exploring the crypts, they came across a courtyard and Polly felt a sudden urge to dig. Amun came to help dig with her, while Sheisho searched the courtyard for treasure and found three immense bird eggs. While she was a little worried about that, she still kept the eggs. Meanwhile, Polly and Amun kept digging until suddenly, Polly cut open her hand on a blade. The pair dug around it and Polly pulled free a glittering longsword that felt perfectly balanced (as all things should be) in Polly's hands. Despite having never seen the sword before in her life, Polly knew its name - Tempest - and that it belonged to her. 

With this new acquisition, the party proceeded deeper into the monastery. They entered a shrine to a mysterious saint and once they had killed the stirges inhabiting the room (but not before Sheisho was drained of a few points of Con), they examined the shrine. Kiril, with the help of the spirits accompanying him, recognised the shrine as being devoted to an obscure regional saint known as Vardishal - a name Sheisho had read while skimming through a book she had picked up in the monastery's library earlier. The name was oddly familiar to Polly as well - almost as if she felt that it was *her* name. Intrigued by this information, Kiril and Sheisho read through the book that she had picked up. Upon more detailed examination (and a couple of *really* high knowledge rolls) Kiril was able to piece together that Vardishal was one of an order of five Jann warriors in service to the genie Nefeshti, known as the Templar of Five Winds. The Templars supposedly did battle with many of the spawn of Rovagug and are regarded as folk heroes of sorts in the region, known for both their names and the legendary weapons they carried: The ruthless Davashuum, wielder of a quarterstaff, the wise and wordly Kardswann who wielded an elaborate greataxe, Pazhvann, the spiritual man wielding a tremendous burning flail, the canny Zayifid, wielder of a deadly but elegant scimitar, and of course the legendary saint of Sarenrae, Vardishal - who was famed for both his skill at arms, and for his weapon - the longsword Tempest.

As Kiril explained this information to the party, they felt a sense of apprehension - while none had ever heard of the Templars of the Five Winds before, they *had* heard of a man named Kardswann - Kardswann was supposedly a man of immense power who had recently taken over the Kulldis tribe of Gnolls and reopened the battle market of Kelmarane as a haven for thieves, murderers and scoundrels across Katapesh. While he may have once been a hero, he was now their enemy - and upon hearing this, Polly was overcome with a sense of betrayal, of disappointment. As the party discussed this information, Amun proposed taking whatever valuables they could and fleeing as far as possible - he had signed up to fight gnolls, not to battle a legendary Jann hero. Polly refused - she needed to find out what these strange feelings meant, to learn the history behind her new blade. Kiril agreed that they should continue - he wanted only to find his sister and he had it on good authority that she was in Kelmarane. Thanna for her part needed to help liberate Kelmarane so that she could go free and Sheisho was not yet ready to give up a 200 gold reward. Reluctantly Amun agreed to continue their mission and for the moment, the party put aside any thoughts of the future, as their job was not yet done. They had swept through most of the monastery, but the chapel still remained - after a moment's rest, they steeled themselves for this final task and set off for the chapel.

And that's all, folks! We ended the session there since we were out of time, but rest assured that there will be another soon! If you'd like to hear what happens next, please let me know! I've never done any campaign journal type thing like this before but I figured it would be fun to keep track of my new game as it unfolded and share the exploits of my group with the people of Reddit. As already mentioned, please refrain from posting any Legacy of Fire spoilers in the comments as some of my players are almost certainly going to read this. If you have any questions about specific things, feel free to ask as well and if you yourself have run or played in a Legacy of Fire game then be sure to let me know how you did things differently to my group.

EDIT: Also, I've put this under the 1E AP flair, but if you guys can think of a more suitable flair to mark this post under then please let me know. I'm not overly familiar with this subreddit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy, people of Reddit! I recently started up a Legacy of Fire campaign, converted to the 1E Pathfinder rules. I have a very fun, quirky group and I figured that it would be an interesting experiment to start up a campaign journal and share it with the world, and I figured this would be the best place to post it. If you&amp;#39;re curious about the conversions I&amp;#39;m using, they&amp;#39;re mostly shamelessly stolen from the internet and while I won&amp;#39;t be posting any links here to avoid spoiling things should my players come across this thread, I&amp;#39;m happy to send them to people privately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re familiar with Legacy of Fire, please refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments, as I have no doubt some of my players will read this and I&amp;#39;d like to surprise them. Note that any kind of familiarity with the adventure path is probably going to be helpful - I&amp;#39;m going to avoid explaining the entire game in detail where possible and just go over the main story beats and/or fun moments, so you might be lost if you&amp;#39;ve never played or run Legacy of Fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s talk about my party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PCs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiril: A young human Oracle hailing from the city of Katapesh, Kiril is a mysterious man touched by the goddess of death, Pharasma, and as a result spirits seem to follow him wherever he goes. He&amp;#39;s a Chaotic Good Oracle with the Haunted curse and the Ancestor mystery, as well as Finding Haleen, Reactionary and Fate&amp;#39;s Favoured as his traits, plus the Lonely drawback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polly Bonne: An Elf paladin from the Nightstalls of Katapesh, Polly is an earnest young woman with a keen eye for a good bargain and a firm sense of justice and fairness. She&amp;#39;s Lawful Good, with the Knight of Coins archetype and the Missionary and Dustwalker Agent traits. As you might have guessed, she&amp;#39;s a devout worshiper of Abadar and aims to restore order and civilisation to the village of Kelmarane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheisho: An enigmatic Vishkanya vigilante of mysterious origin, Sheisho is quiet and inscrutable much of the time. She&amp;#39;s (seemingly) Lawful Neutral, with the Serial Killer archetype and the poisonous slayer and desert child traits. Due to both her heritage and profession, she is an expert in the use of poisons and with her blades is able to use that expertise to deadly effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amun&amp;#39;Setra: A cold, grizzled ranger from a dark, mysterious tribe located somewhere in the south of Osirion, Amun is a hard, dangerous man with a talent for killing and the ability to slip into most areas undedected. He&amp;#39;s Neutral Evil, worships Set and has the Divine Tracker and Skirmisher Archetypes, as well as the Gnoll Killer and Bloodthirsty traits and although he seems to be human, there is a certain cold, unnatural aura about him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanna: A strong, beautiful Orc mesmerist who recently escaped captivity at the hands of her mercenary masters, Thanna is adept at using her wiles and her mystical abilities to get out of danger and has joined the expedition to Kelmarane primarily to earn her freedom, so that she can never be sent back to her masters. She&amp;#39;s Chaotic Neutral, with the autohypnotist and dreamstalker archetypes and with the Charming, Earning Your Freedom and Tusked traits, plus Insatiable as a drawback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a sixth person was hired by the patrons of the party, but due to a night of heavy drinking this mysterious individual missed the camel caravan the rest of the party took to reach them. (Translation: One of my players was busy and couldn&amp;#39;t make the first session.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Session Begins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs had all been hired individually prior to the start of the campaign by Garavel, the major-domo of the merchant princess Almah, to help them retake the ruined village of Kelmarane from the tribe of gnolls that had occupied it. The adventure path itself is pretty vague about the circumstances around this hiring and how/why Garavel decided to hire the PCs and then piss off to his camp without them, but I figured it was a case of him meeting a bunch of applicants of varying quality/integrity a few weeks prior to the expedition and telling the ones who didn&amp;#39;t seem &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; insane where to find him (note that anybody signing up to participate in an expedition to retake a village from a tribe of gnolls in the service of the Carrion King is probably a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; insane). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the session began with the party riding through the hills on a camel caravan as they neared Garavel&amp;#39;s camp at the Sultan&amp;#39;s Claw, this huge-ass tree shaped like a claw. As they topped the last rise and saw his camp, they saw that one of the wagons in the camp was on fire and that the fire was spreading to the Sultan&amp;#39;s Claw itself. The PCs immediately sprung into action as Almah, the leader of the expedition, requested their help and then raced off to try and put out the fire. Sheisho, Kiril and Thanna went to try putting out the fire, while Polly spent the entire encounter struggling to pull another wagon away from the one that was on fire and Amun similarly spent most of the time failing to stabilise a dying mercenary. Fortunately, the players were highly efficient in putting out the fire, with Sheisho deciding it was the best idea in the world to try dual-wielding buckets. And it worked. The fire was extinguished before it could spread and after a few rounds of Amun consistently failing his heal checks to stabilise the mercenary, Thanna took a break from yeeting water at the fire to help. With the combined efforts of Amun, Thanna and the camp&amp;#39;s priest, they saved the mercenary. Oh also there were a bunch of animals running amok that had been freed from their pens somehow and while the module called for handle animal checks to round them up, Thanna&amp;#39;s player said words to the effect of &amp;quot;lol no&amp;quot; and used the slumber hex to put the various goats and chickens to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the fire put out and the animals in their pens, Almah and Garavel took the PCs aside. Almah explained that she suspected arson and, as the PCs weren&amp;#39;t present when the fire started (and thus couldn&amp;#39;t have set it), they would be tasked with investigating. She left them with Garavel, who (after some prodding) admitted that he suspected the camp&amp;#39;s resident tracker and gnoll expert, Dashki, was responsible. Then, Garavel followed after Almah to the command tent and the PCs were let loose to explore the camp and interview its residents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amun, Kiril and Sheisho traveled to the immolated wagon to investigate it, while Thanna and Polly decided to first interview the caravan drivers. As the former group examined the burnt out wagon, they noticed a greasy, disheveled looking man watching them from behind a rock. They called out to him and he walked off in a hurry, prompting them to follow and call out again. Thanna and Polly were distracted from the caravan drivers and rejoined the rest of the party, cornering this man and asking him his name. When they realised it was Dashki, they swiftly accused him of having set the fire. He denied any involvement in the fire, to which Thanna responded with the spell Implant Urge, implanting within Dashki the urge to be honest. He continued to profess his innocence, admitting that he was spying on Almah when the fire was set and claiming that pugwampis were probably responsible for the fire. Amun returned to the wagon to investigate, discovering tiny tracks around it. Then, he went to the animal pen and found similar tracks, which lent some credibility to Dashki&amp;#39;s claims. Polly, deciding to mess with the tracker a little (and also trying to discourage further spying), declared Dashki a pervert and then flipped a coin, declaring that if it landed as heads then she would believe Dashki. Once the other players and I stopped referencing The Dark Knight and No Country for Old Men, Polly did so and while it came up with tails, she just narrowed her eyes and said &amp;quot;I believe you for now.&amp;quot; After a quick discussion with the caravan drivers in which they learned that the prized goat of the husband had gone missing in the chaos, they returned to Almah and Garavel to report their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a new suspect in the setting of the fire, Almah ordered the PCs to follow the tracks with Dashki and, if possible, bring back the pugwampi. And so they followed the tracks, noticing signs that a small animal had been dragged away from the pens. Before traveling any distance, Thanna made sure to cast prestidigation on Dashki to clean him off and make his stench bearable, after which they got moving. As they went, they cast light spells to illuminate the dark path as the sun set, noticing freaky shadows and hearing sounds in the distance as they passed by increasingly frequent cacti. Eventually they heard the bleating of a goat as they came to the edge of a dense thicket of cacti, so thick that they would need to move carefully to avoid being pricked. As they arrived, I explained how they felt a sense of dread and impending doom, and that they could see an injured goat tied up on the other side of the thicket by a shallow ravine. With a job to be done right in front of them, Kiril, Amun and Sheisho rolled up their sleeves and started to wade through the cacti, making periodic acrobatics checks as they went. As they made their first checks, with the most shit-eating grin you will ever see I asked them to roll twice and pick the lower results. When we came to Thanna and Polly (whose players had experiences with pugwampis in previous games), they just nope&amp;#39;d right the fuck out of it, standing still at the edge of the thicket with Dashki, watching as the other three tripped, stumbled and cursed their way through the thicket. Once they had made it through minus a few hit points each, they approached the goat, who promptly freaked the fuck out. Since he was tied off at the edge of a ravine, with a huge cactus jutting out from the wall just below him, this was pretty dangerous. So Thanna just pointed at the goat and put it to sleep, allowing Kiril to untie it with ease. As he did so, an outraged pugwampi emerged from behind a rock in the cactus thicket and started shooting pathetic tiny arrows at the PCs. Kiril and Sheisho ran into the thicket and after tripping a few times while the other party members proved completely ineffectual at engaging it from a distance, they managed to kill the gremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the goat and the dead pugwampi, the PCs returned to camp and presented the corpse to Almah and Garavel. With the mystery solved and Dashki&amp;#39;s name cleared, the gnoll expert claimed the dead pugwampi as a trophy and hung it from his walking staff. With that, Almah sat the PCs down to discuss the terms of their employment - she offered them 200 gold apiece for their part in retaking the village of Kelmarane. The players happily accepted this sum, at which point Almah ordered them to go and clear out the nearby abandoned monastery to serve as a new base of operations, seeing as how the Sultan&amp;#39;s Claw was too exposed. The players agreed and the following morning set off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they reached the monastery, they decided that they would clear it out room by room rather than heading straight for the main chapel right away. Thus, they swept through the rooms swiftly - they killed four pugwampis in the kitchen, then battled with five baboons and a pair of wandering pugwampis before finding themselves in the dormitories of the monastery. In the neighbouring tower, Amun gazed up and noticed something furry poking out from a nook in the wall high up. His immediate reaction was to try shooting it, as is reasonable.  Unfortunately he missed and wrecked his arrow. Then, Kiril attempted to move the furry thing with Mage Hand, but to no avail as it was too big. So Thanna attempted to use her Slumber ability on whatever it was. It failed. With that, Amun picked up a rock and threw it as hard as he could against the wall next to the nook. That seemed to catch the furry thing&amp;#39;s attention, as it immediately retreated further into the nook, disappearing from sight. The players decided it was probably nothing and went down the nearby stairs to explore the crypts below the monastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They emerged in a large laboratory and spread out to search the place. Kiril and Polly approached a pair of dirty glass containers filled with a luminescent green liquid crusted with mold. Kiril noticed it was quivering a little. Then it attacked them. The rest of the party raced in to help them pretty quickly and destroyed the oozes in short order, but not before one of them managed to scratch Polly up a little. At first this didn&amp;#39;t seem like a big deal, but after they finished exploring the crypts, they came across a courtyard and Polly felt a sudden urge to dig. Amun came to help dig with her, while Sheisho searched the courtyard for treasure and found three immense bird eggs. While she was a little worried about that, she still kept the eggs. Meanwhile, Polly and Amun kept digging until suddenly, Polly cut open her hand on a blade. The pair dug around it and Polly pulled free a glittering longsword that felt perfectly balanced (as all things should be) in Polly&amp;#39;s hands. Despite having never seen the sword before in her life, Polly knew its name - Tempest - and that it belonged to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new acquisition, the party proceeded deeper into the monastery. They entered a shrine to a mysterious saint and once they had killed the stirges inhabiting the room (but not before Sheisho was drained of a few points of Con), they examined the shrine. Kiril, with the help of the spirits accompanying him, recognised the shrine as being devoted to an obscure regional saint known as Vardishal - a name Sheisho had read while skimming through a book she had picked up in the monastery&amp;#39;s library earlier. The name was oddly familiar to Polly as well - almost as if she felt that it was &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; name. Intrigued by this information, Kiril and Sheisho read through the book that she had picked up. Upon more detailed examination (and a couple of &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; high knowledge rolls) Kiril was able to piece together that Vardishal was one of an order of five Jann warriors in service to the genie Nefeshti, known as the Templar of Five Winds. The Templars supposedly did battle with many of the spawn of Rovagug and are regarded as folk heroes of sorts in the region, known for both their names and the legendary weapons they carried: The ruthless Davashuum, wielder of a quarterstaff, the wise and wordly Kardswann who wielded an elaborate greataxe, Pazhvann, the spiritual man wielding a tremendous burning flail, the canny Zayifid, wielder of a deadly but elegant scimitar, and of course the legendary saint of Sarenrae, Vardishal - who was famed for both his skill at arms, and for his weapon - the longsword Tempest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kiril explained this information to the party, they felt a sense of apprehension - while none had ever heard of the Templars of the Five Winds before, they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; heard of a man named Kardswann - Kardswann was supposedly a man of immense power who had recently taken over the Kulldis tribe of Gnolls and reopened the battle market of Kelmarane as a haven for thieves, murderers and scoundrels across Katapesh. While he may have once been a hero, he was now their enemy - and upon hearing this, Polly was overcome with a sense of betrayal, of disappointment. As the party discussed this information, Amun proposed taking whatever valuables they could and fleeing as far as possible - he had signed up to fight gnolls, not to battle a legendary Jann hero. Polly refused - she needed to find out what these strange feelings meant, to learn the history behind her new blade. Kiril agreed that they should continue - he wanted only to find his sister and he had it on good authority that she was in Kelmarane. Thanna for her part needed to help liberate Kelmarane so that she could go free and Sheisho was not yet ready to give up a 200 gold reward. Reluctantly Amun agreed to continue their mission and for the moment, the party put aside any thoughts of the future, as their job was not yet done. They had swept through most of the monastery, but the chapel still remained - after a moment&amp;#39;s rest, they steeled themselves for this final task and set off for the chapel.&lt;/p&gt;

That means our characters will only be level and then instead of leveling you get feats. So only level 6 class abilities, but the ability to build some different feat chains.

It will be a 25 point buy and I was thinking on making a Desna worshiping Tempered champion paladin. Because it seems like a build that can work with a few feats, but you can continue to upgrade it for a long time. I have seen people online say that you can't be a paladin of desna because of allignment, but as far as I can see that is only in pathfinder society, as only clerics have worship restrictions based on allignment.

So I have been thinking on going human. Mostly because I haven't made a human for a long time. Go with a stat array like this:

str: 10 dex: 15 con: 15 int: 10 wis: 10 cha:17(+2)

Take Fey Foundling and Way of the shooting star as lvl 1 feats and then I have a flexible and rather strong basic build that allows me to do a number of different things.

**Standard sword and board**

By putting on heavy armour and a shield(Maybe a buckler) this is like a standard sword and board build, with slightly better healing and saves, but slightly lower damagde at the early levels. Being a tempered champion means that the star knifes will deal d6 damagde at lvl 4 and d8 damagde at lvl 6. Smite will give more ac than normal because of the high charisma, but less offensive, because I am already getting + charisma to hit.

*Items:*

*Feats:*

Weapon focus (Star Knife), weapon specialization(Star knife)

**Duel wielding**

With a belt of dexterity +2, the paladin will be able to get improved two weapon fighting. Reading way of the shooting star it seems like the paladin will get full charisma to damadge with off hand weapon and if I carry a buckler then I can shift betwen sword and board and dual wielding depending on the combat situation.

*Items:*

+2 dex item

*Feats:*

Two weapon fighting, improved two weapon fighting.

**Edited in Combining dual wield and sword and board**

An enchanted buckler can give quiet a bit of ac. With these two feats and a +2 buckler I would get +4 ac, while only taking -1 to hit with my buckler hand attacks.

*items:*

+2 buckler

*feats:*

Shield Focus, Unhindering Shield 

**Thrown weapon**

It is often good to have a backup ranged weapon, but being able to do ranged damagde might also increase the paladins damagde in some situation where he would instead have to move over to his enemies and thus can't full attack.

*Items:*

Blinkback Belt(2500 gold)

*Feats:*

Quick draw, Point blank shoot, Precise Shot, Rapid shot.

**Animal companion**

Temepered chamion doesn't get a mount and animal companions are always great. It owuld be nice to get an ape or something that the paladin can ride inside a dungeon, but the only feat I know that give an animal companion is Animal ally.

*Feats:*

Nature soul, Animal ally

**Other good feats:**

Extra lay on hands, for more healing and to power divine bond.

**Other good items:**

Mithrial full plate, to make full use of the high dex.

Now I noticed that I don't have a backup character yet (at least not made especially for that campaign) and today I scrolled through that thread about overlookes and underrated classes.

So now I came here to ask if any occult class goes especially well with the concept of a skill monkey (maybe with a lot of fun in the build involved). I'd prefer to go occult for my backup character since I did not yet create even one of those but if you guys have other suggestions that are neither rogue nor bard I'd like to hear them too.

It's really nice to have some specific archetypes to look into and also I had completly forgotten, that there is an investigator archetype that casts psychic spells","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I am currently playing in a campaign where I wanted to take on the role of the skill monkey and kind of did that as a Rogue (we started lvl 4 and I multiclassed for flavour). Now I noticed that I don&amp;#39;t have a backup character yet (at least not made especially for that campaign) and today I scrolled through that thread about overlookes and underrated classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I came here to ask if any occult class goes especially well with the concept of a skill monkey (maybe with a lot of fun in the build involved). I&amp;#39;d prefer to go occult for my backup character since I did not yet create even one of those but if you guys have other suggestions that are neither rogue nor bard I&amp;#39;d like to hear them too.&lt;/p&gt;

I jumped on one night, there was little activity, but a DM wanted to run a mid level game. I jumped into the game along with two other players. One player I had never been in a game with and didn't know what to expect out of them. The other player I had many experiences with. He was playing Erenax. A barbarian that worships the chaos gods from the Warhammer Universe. He had a mana wasted mutant template which meant he was way more powerful than any other physical fighter in our tier of play. This guy was hardcore about combat, war, and killing everything that stood in front of him. I on the other hand was playing a man-whore, a coward, and an artist. Watson Spellsear, a bastard child of the leader of our nation, a divine healer, and a chronicler.       \nThe Session    \n\nOn Founding Day, a holiday celebrating the nations birth, the city of Dweomerstar threw a massive festival and with the presence of adventurers the whole thing went awry. Watson gathered a crowd with his antics before slipping off and seducing an amazonian. The festival included a drug dealing turtle, biological attacks, riots, parties, many drug related arrests, a possessed house leaving the city, and magic cops.    \n\nWatson woke up in a large bed with a large woman. He wiggled away from the amazonian’s bed without waking her up. He did his best to cook breakfast for her with little luck. She was still thankful for the effort and the fact that Watson turned out to be a nice guy. When Watson left her house the weeds and grass grew, poking through the cobblestone street, and started to stretch towards Watson grabbing at him. Watson tried to keep walking but the cobblestone crumbled, vines and ivy stretched across the buildings, the people stretched into the sky growing rigid and wooden. Watson began vomiting as he found himself in a forest, in another dimension, in the abyss. Erenax pushed him against a tree, his glazed over eyes scanned along Watson’s body, seeing no threat Erenax pulled his arm away from Watson.     \n\nErenax was a massive armored hulk, barely any part of him was visible. He fought with a giant axe, did insane damage, and scared the shit out of Watson. They had fought before. Watson wasn't sure why Erenax had let him live. But the two hated each other.     \n\nErenax and a female Magus, Faunra, were escorting a child known as 6. The child seemed to be partially demon and knew the forest very well. The forest was The Endless Forest of King; a region with in the endless Abyss. King was a large demonic primate, a Girallon, and had grown powerful enough to challenge the other Demons Princes for their title. His strength, his domain, his army, and his natural magic made him a feared entity that was very young in comparison to the demon princes of millions of years in age.     \n\nThe team fought Girallon scouts with ease, before fighting a wild Megaprimatus, that Watson managed to sedate and ‘tame’. They followed the Girallon deeper into the Jungle, as Watson had convinced it to lead them to King. The group eventually had to camp for the night as they reached a giant alter. The alter was a giant bloodstained ape. They made their camp around the base of the statue as for some reason it felt safer near the statue. This came to bite them in the ass, as an ambush was quickly set up. Invisible creatures came from every angle, smashing through defenses and surrounding the party. King himself came out of invisibility to challenge Erenax. They fought, landing heavy blows on each other, but the massive armored mutant was dwarfed by the demon ape. Physically beating him in a one on one fight rather than using minions or magic. King crushed Erenax’s armor under his heavy fists, and the mana wasted mutant blood knight was killed easily. Faunra fought several Girallon at once, lightning arced off her sword as she slashed through ape flesh. With a solid punch she was knocked to the ground. Before getting back up one of them held her down, bashing her against the ground, and tore her limbs off one by one.     \n\nWatson backed away from the carnage, holding his spear outwards, keeping the child, 6, behind him. Seeing no way out he told 6 to run while he distracts them. 6 didn’t move from behind him. As King approached Watson looked back at 6 who was soiling himself. The kid wouldn’t blink or breath let alone run. Watson dropped his spear, fell to the ground, and grovelled before the King. He begged for his life, for King to be merciful, he pledged himself to King and to the forest. He was spared. 6 was not. Plucked up by his collar and swallowed whole. Watson was then asked by King to join in the feast. As the demon apes tore through the two fallen heroes. Watson ate a bit of Erenax, under gruesome peer pressure, but more importantly Watson snuck pieces of flesh into his pockets. Securing the continued future of the two deceased heroes.      \n\nWatson was taken back to the war camp of the demons. In shock Watson tried to make the best of things by joking around with the apes, when he had no responses from them he began to admire the instruments in the camp. He tried his best to not notice that the instruments were made of human corpses, bones, and stretched skin. Escorted straight through the camp, the beat of the war drums intensified, and King procured a powder. He gave it to Watson in a small bag, and had him ingest it. The powder clung to his mouth and throat threatening to choke him, it was bitter, sour. Watson felt intense pain, pressure, as his body started to change. The drug hit Watson like an epiphany; the Girallon soldiers have human eyes. Watson fell to his knees, snot running out of his nose, drool spilling out, tears splattering against the bloody dirt, and a long winded scream pouring out of his lungs. His own teeth plopped onto the wet ground below him, his nails grew into claws, and the scream became a muted cry. He could feel himself growing larger, the white fur starting to spread over his body, his jaw changing, jagged teeth growing through the gums, and a second set of arms threatening to burst from his sides.      \n\nA tiny bit of light was in Watson’s brain. It was Dweomerstar, it was the Sorbiens, the citizens, and the adventurers. He gritted his sharp teeth and focused on them as his mind grew numb. The transformation threatened to take his mind, his sanity, his free will. Watson thought of the people that needed him, the people that were kind to him, and of the journeys left untold. Watson stopped growing larger, almost started to shrink, the pressure in his sides subsided, the fur stopped growing, it faded slowly to gray, and his jaw set back in place. He had resisted the transformation and was left disfigured. With the successful DC 34 constitution and wisdom save Watson lived. ḰI̵̴͟͝N̸̵͜G̢̡̧͟ seeing this was furious. He roared almost deafening Watson and the surrounding Girallons. The pain was immense and was felt by the entire horde as his roar echoed in their minds. Watson could feel it, K̶̛͘͟͠Í͠Ņ̴̸͢͝G̡̧̡͡’s presence in the back of his mind, and the knowledge that his senses were no longer just his. K̵̷̢̛͟I̴N҉͠G̷̴ picked Watson up and swallowed him whole. Watson remembered seeing 6 before the wet feeling turned to cold air, the dark insides became a dark night sky, and the cramped feeling was relieved by the open space of the Dweomerstar roads.      \n\nh̴̀͠a̢̕i̷̶̶͞l̛ ̶̨̨̨͞t̷̸̸̶̴o̴̴͞ ҉̵̨́͜t̕͜h̸҉e̷̸͟͟͟ ̨͝ḰI̵̴͟͝N̸̵͜G̢̡̧͟     \n\nWatson left the flesh with a church, paying for Faunra’s resurrection, left what was left of Erenax with her, and fled the city to avoid any retribution from Erenax. He did not want to discuss the death of 6 with Erenax who had promised to protect him. With the help of mage hand Watson kept himself fairly shaved and human. Especially with illusionary magic to make him prettier. Watson also learned how to control a new appendage, a monkey tail. The tale of Watson was far from over.

This guy was hardcore about combat, war, and killing everything that stood in front of him. I on the other hand was playing a man-whore, a coward, and an artist. Watson Spellsear, a bastard child of the leader of our nation, a divine healer, and a chronicler.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe Session    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Founding Day, a holiday celebrating the nations birth, the city of Dweomerstar threw a massive festival and with the presence of adventurers the whole thing went awry. Watson gathered a crowd with his antics before slipping off and seducing an amazonian. The festival included a drug dealing turtle, biological attacks, riots, parties, many drug related arrests, a possessed house leaving the city, and magic cops.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watson woke up in a large bed with a large woman. He wiggled away from the amazonian’s bed without waking her up. He did his best to cook breakfast for her with little luck. She was still thankful for the effort and the fact that Watson turned out to be a nice guy. When Watson left her house the weeds and grass grew, poking through the cobblestone street, and started to stretch towards Watson grabbing at him. Watson tried to keep walking but the cobblestone crumbled, vines and ivy stretched across the buildings, the people stretched into the sky growing rigid and wooden. Watson began vomiting as he found himself in a forest, in another dimension, in the abyss. Erenax pushed him against a tree, his glazed over eyes scanned along Watson’s body, seeing no threat Erenax pulled his arm away from Watson.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Erenax was a massive armored hulk, barely any part of him was visible. He fought with a giant axe, did insane damage, and scared the shit out of Watson. They had fought before. Watson wasn&amp;#39;t sure why Erenax had let him live. But the two hated each other.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Erenax and a female Magus, Faunra, were escorting a child known as 6. The child seemed to be partially demon and knew the forest very well. The forest was The Endless Forest of King; a region with in the endless Abyss. King was a large demonic primate, a Girallon, and had grown powerful enough to challenge the other Demons Princes for their title. His strength, his domain, his army, and his natural magic made him a feared entity that was very young in comparison to the demon princes of millions of years in age.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The team fought Girallon scouts with ease, before fighting a wild Megaprimatus, that Watson managed to sedate and ‘tame’. They followed the Girallon deeper into the Jungle, as Watson had convinced it to lead them to King. The group eventually had to camp for the night as they reached a giant alter. The alter was a giant bloodstained ape. They made their camp around the base of the statue as for some reason it felt safer near the statue. This came to bite them in the ass, as an ambush was quickly set up. Invisible creatures came from every angle, smashing through defenses and surrounding the party. King himself came out of invisibility to challenge Erenax. They fought, landing heavy blows on each other, but the massive armored mutant was dwarfed by the demon ape. Physically beating him in a one on one fight rather than using minions or magic. King crushed Erenax’s armor under his heavy fists, and the mana wasted mutant blood knight was killed easily. Faunra fought several Girallon at once, lightning arced off her sword as she slashed through ape flesh. With a solid punch she was knocked to the ground. Before getting back up one of them held her down, bashing her against the ground, and tore her limbs off one by one.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watson backed away from the carnage, holding his spear outwards, keeping the child, 6, behind him. Seeing no way out he told 6 to run while he distracts them. 6 didn’t move from behind him. As King approached Watson looked back at 6 who was soiling himself. The kid wouldn’t blink or breath let alone run. Watson dropped his spear, fell to the ground, and grovelled before the King. He begged for his life, for King to be merciful, he pledged himself to King and to the forest. He was spared. 6 was not. Plucked up by his collar and swallowed whole. Watson was then asked by King to join in the feast. As the demon apes tore through the two fallen heroes. Watson ate a bit of Erenax, under gruesome peer pressure, but more importantly Watson snuck pieces of flesh into his pockets. Securing the continued future of the two deceased heroes.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watson was taken back to the war camp of the demons. In shock Watson tried to make the best of things by joking around with the apes, when he had no responses from them he began to admire the instruments in the camp. He tried his best to not notice that the instruments were made of human corpses, bones, and stretched skin. Escorted straight through the camp, the beat of the war drums intensified, and King procured a powder. He gave it to Watson in a small bag, and had him ingest it. The powder clung to his mouth and throat threatening to choke him, it was bitter, sour. Watson felt intense pain, pressure, as his body started to change. The drug hit Watson like an epiphany; the Girallon soldiers have human eyes. Watson fell to his knees, snot running out of his nose, drool spilling out, tears splattering against the bloody dirt, and a long winded scream pouring out of his lungs. His own teeth plopped onto the wet ground below him, his nails grew into claws, and the scream became a muted cry. He could feel himself growing larger, the white fur starting to spread over his body, his jaw changing, jagged teeth growing through the gums, and a second set of arms threatening to burst from his sides.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tiny bit of light was in Watson’s brain. It was Dweomerstar, it was the Sorbiens, the citizens, and the adventurers. He gritted his sharp teeth and focused on them as his mind grew numb. The transformation threatened to take his mind, his sanity, his free will. Watson thought of the people that needed him, the people that were kind to him, and of the journeys left untold. Watson stopped growing larger, almost started to shrink, the pressure in his sides subsided, the fur stopped growing, it faded slowly to gray, and his jaw set back in place. He had resisted the transformation and was left disfigured. With the successful DC 34 constitution and wisdom save Watson lived. ḰI̵̴͟͝N̸̵͜G̢̡̧͟ seeing this was furious. He roared almost deafening Watson and the surrounding Girallons. The pain was immense and was felt by the entire horde as his roar echoed in their minds. Watson could feel it, K̶̛͘͟͠Í͠Ņ̴̸͢͝G̡̧̡͡’s presence in the back of his mind, and the knowledge that his senses were no longer just his. K̵̷̢̛͟I̴N҉͠G̷̴ picked Watson up and swallowed him whole. Watson remembered seeing 6 before the wet feeling turned to cold air, the dark insides became a dark night sky, and the cramped feeling was relieved by the open space of the Dweomerstar roads.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;h̴̀͠a̢̕i̷̶̶͞l̛ ̶̨̨̨͞t̷̸̸̶̴o̴̴͞ ҉̵̨́͜t̕͜h̸҉e̷̸͟͟͟ ̨͝ḰI̵̴͟͝N̸̵͜G̢̡̧͟     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watson left the flesh with a church, paying for Faunra’s resurrection, left what was left of Erenax with her, and fled the city to avoid any retribution from Erenax. He did not want to discuss the death of 6 with Erenax who had promised to protect him. With the help of mage hand Watson kept himself fairly shaved and human. Especially with illusionary magic to make him prettier. Watson also learned how to control a new appendage, a monkey tail. The tale of Watson was far from over. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '0d39632a-35a8-11e3-a543-12313d18f999', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2wqgc', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'b0eald', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'therottingbard', 'num_crossposts': 1, 'num_comments': 1, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/gametales/comments/b0eald/blade_and_bow_dweomerstar_fighting_a_demon_prince/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/b0eald/blade_and_bow_dweomerstar_fighting_a_demon_prince/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 40650, 'created_utc': 1552430877.0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",,self.gametales,0,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",False,False,b0efzy,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,,#000080,1e,[],54852290-f00b-11e4-a880-22000b39c38c,1E Other,light,text,False,,{},,False,,,,[],t3_b0efzy,False,6,0,,False,all_ads,/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/b0efzy/when_i_knew_i_was_hooked_on_pathfinder/,False,,,6,False,,,False,13,,{},,,True,False,False,Pathfinder_RPG,t5_2trms,r/Pathfinder_RPG,65279,public,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Us-emlciVa93VJgOS7geFERVigbYpyK6AUFKtjrOw5o.jpg,140.0,140.0,When I Knew I was Hooked on Pathfinder,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/b0eald/blade_and_bow_dweomerstar_fighting_a_demon_prince/,[],,False,all_ads,6

   1. For now i ordered the Gamescreen, Bestiary and a Battlemap. I am not sure about buying into an AP right away as i do not know yet what my future players like.
2. Which APs are ""newbie friendly""?

Maybe some of you can give me some overview about ""Genres"". SA = Horror, RotR = High Fantasy, Skulls&amp;Shackles = Pirates, something like that.
3. Any tips and tricks you would give a new GM?

I started putting meat on the bones of the political system, figuring out which nobles they'll need to influence, how public opinion is going to work, and so on. Put two weeks into that. The players suck at emails and staying in contact between games, so I got a chance to get about half of them in a room last week and ask them how they think they're going to go about ending slavery.

All of them plan to storm the offices and warehouses of any slave trading company and kill everyone.

They're level 2.

They're all aware that the city guard is scary and competent.

I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of kids and they don&amp;#39;t like being herded through an AP, so I&amp;#39;ve got a homebrew that is specifically designed to be full of choices. They&amp;#39;ve discovered that slavery is legal in this setting, and they&amp;#39;ve decided to end slavery with a single minded focus I&amp;#39;ve not yet seen. I started putting meat on the bones of the political system, figuring out which nobles they&amp;#39;ll need to influence, how public opinion is going to work, and so on. Put two weeks into that. The players suck at emails and staying in contact between games, so I got a chance to get about half of them in a room last week and ask them how they think they&amp;#39;re going to go about ending slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them plan to storm the offices and warehouses of any slave trading company and kill everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re level 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re all aware that the city guard is scary and competent.&lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance  


This gaunt, ghoulish figure’s skin is inscribed with faintly glowing runes. Short-lived afterimages trail behind it.

####CR   12
#####Alignment:  LE
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Special Attacks: A psychic lich gains the special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the lich’s HD + the lich’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.

Bewildering Touch (Su): Any living creature a psychic lich hits with its touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently confused as its nervous system continuously sends false signals. The creature doesn’t automatically attack the psychic lich if it is targeted by further attacks. Calm emotions or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description) with a DC equal to the bewildering touch’s save DC. As a full-round action, a creature that rolls a result of “act normally” can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect.

Psychic Feast (Ex): If a psychic lich succeeds at a Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, it instead avoids the effect entirely. If the effect was a spell with the mind-affecting descriptor, the psychic lich also heals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus the spell’s caster level if it succeeds at its save. A psychic lich may automatically succeed on any Will save against a spell it casts that targets only itself.

Rejuvenation (Su): When a psychic lich is destroyed, its body reforms near its astral memoir 10d10 days later. If a creature reads the psychic lich’s memoir, the total time is reduced to one tenth the original result, which could result in the psychic lich’s immediate restoration in a new body. Once the time elapses, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body).

The only way to ensure that a psychic lich does not rejuvenate is to target its memoir with the spell instigate psychic duelOA or mindscape doorOA or use it as a special focus when casting plane shift or similar magic. This allows one creature to instigate a psychic duel (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 202) on a veiled, harmful mindscape with a self-contained shape inhabited by the lich’s astral legend. The legend has the statistics of the lich, can’t leave the mindscape by any means, and is permanently destroyed if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. An astral legend can’t be destroyed unless the psychic lich’s physical body has also been destroyed and has not yet rejuvenated.

Weaknesses: A psychic lich doesn’t gain immunity to mind-affecting effects as a result of becoming undead. If the base creature is immune to any mind-affecting effects, it loses those immunities and instead gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against such effects.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

To become a psychic lich, one must create and infuse a memoir, which serves a similar function to an ordinary lich’s phylactery. This memoir projects the lich’s personal legend into the Astral Plane, which is tethered through the planes to a physical object, typically a magically strengthened book or scroll (10 hit points, hardness 1, break DC 15). The only way to destroy the lich is to destroy his astral legend, which almost always requires the memoir as a special focus. Unless the astral legend is erased, the lich can rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Psychic Lich, below).

Each psychic lich must create its own memoir by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast psychic spells at a caster level of 11th or higher. The memoir costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.

If the physical memoir is destroyed while the psychic lich’s astral legend survives, the physical memoir gradually reforms over the course of 1d10 days at a site central to its creator’s history (such as the library where he first studied magic or the battlefield where he vanquished a powerful rival). It typically reappears hidden among other books or treasures, where an unwitting dupe might begin reading the text and hasten the psychic lich’s return.

The last session we had was the end of the campaign I ran as DM and that was October 2018. 

I haven't played since then but then spent the next few months creating a new character with the help of many people from this sub in preparation for the next campaign (someone else is taking over as DM, we have been rotating). 

I was getting super anxious to start and I was curbing it by creating multiple back-up characters.

I was able to gather up a small group and I left them to plan their characters. Unfortunately, that's taken some time as well and so I again started getting anxious to play.

I even bought a brand new set of dice, bought the beginner box for the group I'm running, and prepared various apps to use in both groups and I was really starting to get bummed out at the delays. But now, we are finally solidifying our plans and I'm getting so hyped!

Edits: I'm in the middle of tossing useful links into the text. Though, as the post just got removed until i Flair it, it's not like you'll notice a difference :p

Edit 2: Done \^

So:

\-What feats/[Arcana](https://aonprd.com/MagusArcana.aspx) would be essential to an Eldritch Archer?

\-What order would i be looking to take them in?

\-[Hexcrafter](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Magus%20Hexcrafter), [BeastBlade](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Magus%20Beastblade), or neither? (They stack with Eld. Archer, but not eachother)

&amp;#x200B;

Eldritch Archers get a bonded item like Wizards do, albeit it can only be a ranged weapon.

\-Would a gun or a bow be better, and what unwritten limitations would there be to choosing my weapon? (For example, could i take a Composite Longbow with a full +5 strength modifier as my bonded weapon, assuming i had enough strength to wield it?)

\-It's Masterwork by default, but can it be upgraded into a Magic weapon later? What levels could i expect to start upgrading it, if so? I'd assume a Masterwork weapon would fall off in usefulness later, even with Magus's arcane pool and temporary weapon enchantments. &gt;!(which also seems quite inefficient on a Masterwork weapon, since there always needs to be that +1 enhancement bonus that doesn't stack with Masterwork's bonus, before you can actually start adding properties)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who doesn't mind trading a *bit* of optimization for crafting &gt;!(to make equipment optimization a bit less GM dependent, and to further support my party; the Magus seems pretty good at both debuffs and battlefield control, it's just a shame Eld. Archer can't make good use of Frostbite until 9th level where an Arcana finally lets me tack the Touch spells Magus is known for onto my ranged attacks)!&lt;, what should i look for in terms of Feats/Race/Etc, and when should i take them? &gt;!(The !&lt;[Aphorite](https://aonprd.com/RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aphorite)&gt;! race actually looks really, really nice for a Composite Bow based Eld. Archer Magus who does a bit of crafting on the side)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything crucial i'm overlooking? Any dips that might prove useful? Should i lean more towards Archery/Gun wielding, or magecraft? Would i have enough feats and whatnot to 'focus' on both and remain effective? ...Etc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, looking to make a build, and looking for help/tips on optimizing it, but don&amp;#39;t actually have a game in which to use the build.

Archer can&amp;#39;t make good use of Frostbite until 9th level where an Arcana finally lets me tack the Touch spells Magus is known for onto my ranged attacks)&lt;/span&gt;, what should i look for in terms of Feats/Race/Etc, and when should i take them? &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;(The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://aonprd.com/RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aphorite""&gt;Aphorite&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;! race actually looks really, really nice for a Composite Bow based Eld. Archer Magus who does a bit of crafting on the side)!&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything crucial i&amp;#39;m overlooking? Any dips that might prove useful? Should i lean more towards Archery/Gun wielding, or magecraft? Would i have enough feats and whatnot to &amp;#39;focus&amp;#39; on both and remain effective? ...Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

So here are some more basic RPG questions that I hope you can help me with:

1. Situation: party is walking down a road, enemies are standing in the middle of the road. How do you determine if there is a surprise round? The enemy and the party are both not sneaking, but it could happen that the party or the enemy is very loud or has a bright light for example, meaning the other would get a chance to hide in real life. In the game, this means I would give either the party or the enemy a bonus to Perception, but the Perception skill mentions that it should be used against Stealth, which does not apply yet as they are not hiding yet. **How do you determine if someone gets the opportunity to hide? And also: how far away should the enemy be if no one is surprised?**
2. Flow between exploring and battle. Let's say I've planned an encounter while the party is travelling, for example: when the party arrives at river X they could notice the entrance to a dungeon on the river shore if they explore a bit. The party is doing their exploration stuff like buying gear in the town, getting their horses, etc., and then they start travelling. **Do I just fastforward until they are at the river? Do I describe the scenery along the whole way and wait for them to tell me if they want to take a closer look at something? Since most encounters are battles, if I 'stop the fastforward' they will usually prepare for battle, but is this something I should try to avoid?**
3. Traps. One of my players likes to roll perception everytime he enters a room, but does not tell me what his character is doing (just looking around for anything unusual I guess). Another player does the opposite, he describes that his character is looking around an area for anything unusual, but does not roll until I tell him to. **If the only thing they can find are traps, do I let them roll for Perception if they don't mention the traps? If they do mention they want to look for traps but there is only a secret door, do I let them roll for Perception to detect the door? If they don't mention anything but they do enter a room with a trap, do I give them a hint by saying 'the floor looks different here' or something like that?**
4. Sense motive. **Do I let the players roll Sense Motive if they ask for it but the NPC is actually not lying? And for the opposite case: the PC is not lying but the truth is very hard to believe, do I let the NPC roll for Sense Motive or not? And if an NPC is lying but the player does not suspect it, yet I feel the character might get a suspicion, do I help the player by telling them to roll for Sense Motive or do I give a hint like '\[character name\] finds this suspicious'?**
5. Knowledge checks. **If an unknown monster comes up, and the players tell me they want to figure out what it is, should I tell them 'roll for Knowledge Religion' if it is an undead monster but they don't know that it is and haven't told me they want to know whether it's undead?** Telling the players which Knowledge check to roll already gives a lot of information.

I've got a plot, I've got the first session planned, ideas for where to go from there. Almost everything is set.   
  
However, I'm working on something for the second half of the plot that I'd like to tease in the first few sessions, and wanted your input.

I have a few ideas, but I'd like to see what you guys come up with. I'm especially interested in weird, fun/funny/interesting ideas that players wouldn't be frustrated fighting, but would present interesting challenges.  
  
Right now, I'm planning on a Gunslinger, to tie into a players backstory, a Rogue who might multi/prestige, a pair of Bards, a Slayer of some sort, and an Antipaladin with ties to the BBEG.

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m a fairly new GM looking to run a (hopefully) long and fruitful homebrew campaign for my players.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a plot, I&amp;#39;ve got the first session planned, ideas for where to go from there. Almost everything is set.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;m working on something for the second half of the plot that I&amp;#39;d like to tease in the first few sessions, and wanted your input.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to have the BBEG begin sending level appropriate Assassins after them. Character builds I put together myself, to challenge the party. I have a few ideas, but I&amp;#39;d like to see what you guys come up with. I&amp;#39;m especially interested in weird, fun/funny/interesting ideas that players wouldn&amp;#39;t be frustrated fighting, but would present interesting challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;
