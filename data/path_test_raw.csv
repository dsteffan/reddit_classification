It was fun while it lasted, but we understand that we should really get back into the swing of things. 

I'm sure that you've heard the mods mention some changes are afoot with regards to the sub. Implementation of these changes are off to a slow start at the moment and we can only again apologise that we are not working as quickly as we intended. 

That being said, I am pleased to inform everyone that one of our planned changes is coming into effect as of this moment.

Our mischief in tampering with the flairs list during April Fool's Day was the starting point for the mods to actually update our official flairs. The list is now a little more streamlined and we hope this simplifies things a little bit for you all.

With the updating of the flairs list of course comes the updating of the flairs explanation post. That's what this post essentially is. You will find a quick breakdown of the flairs below which we hope would be helpful to you in utilising this sub.

As before, we require everyone to please flair their posts appropriately. 

This post will be temporarily stickied for visibility and eventually moved to the sidebar when we get to updating that as well! Apologies for any inconvenience and we really appreciate everyone's patience thus far.

**How to flair a post:**

It's really easy. Once your post is submitted, right above the comments there should be a line of commands for your post. One of these is Flair. Click that and it will open up a list of flairs for you to select. Click on the most appropriate one and then select ""save.""

On mobile, you should have the option to flair posts as well. Some reddit apps are different than others, but usually in the upper right-hand corner there will be a menu from which you can edit your post flair.

**What our flairs mean:**

* **As a Player (1e or 2e)**: Anything regarding being a player for a specific edition. Character talk, build advice and all other topics relating to the Pathfinder experience **as a player on the table** falls under this category

* **As a GM (1e or 2e)**: Anything regarding running a game from behind the GM screen for a specific edition. Discussing subsystems, rules interactions, encounter building, and all other topics relating to the Pathfinder experience **as the GM of the table** falls under this category.

* **Resources (1e or 2e)**: Submission or discussion of character sheets, tools, generators, and 
general utilities that make gaming easier. Apps and guides that directly assist in enhancing the Pathfinder experience fall under this category.

* **Shameless self-promo**: Use this to promote your Pathfinder-specific activities, products, and original contributions. Please note that our subreddit rules for self-promotion applies. Podcasts, original art commissions, funding requests, and all other posts with the intent to monetize or provide exposure to your specific Pathfinder experience and Pathfinder-related skills fall under this category.

* **Other**: Used as a miscellaneous category for anything our flairs don’t cover.


In addition, we have our Weekly Discussion posts that will be used exclusively for the stickied weekly posts. They are as follows:

####Ecology  

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is hatched with conventional horse colors and markings.

The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the company of a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one—before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle’s straps interfere with the creature’s wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Ride check each round merely to control his mount.

Pegasi lay eggs—they are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies.

Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.

A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds.

In some pegasi, the blood of a mighty heroic stallion ancestor runs strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, the advanced template, perfect flight maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no training to fly with a rider, but only allow themselves to be ridden by great heroes.

Currently, the character is a Sorcerer 1, Barbarian 1, Wizard 17, (Archmage 9) with massive INT (and so pretty high spell DC's). I'm thinking of using the following spells as a base:

&amp;#x200B;

Mythic Time Stop to get in position

&amp;#x200B;

Widened Jatembe's Ire (Greater Black Tentacles)

&amp;#x200B;

Empowered Mythic Circle of Death

&amp;#x200B;

Augmented Mythic Cloudkill (gotta bypass that pesky poison immunity)

&amp;#x200B;

Greater Siege of Trees (because it's a personal favorite of mine)

&amp;#x200B;

As a Spell Sage wizard (with Wild Arcana), I have access to any 9th-level and lower spell of the Wizard, Druid, Cleric, and Bard spell lists, although I can only cast 4 non-wizard spells and they take a while to cast (which is why I might just slap a few into some Contingencies). I'm also tempted to go against the mold and use Shapechange to turn into a Gorgon and petrify everything, although I probably won't get a chance to go this ham for a long time afterwards.

And, by the way, the PCs in this adventure are named &amp;quot;Windy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Grubs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rakket&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Sten&amp;quot;; you&amp;#39;ll see those names frequently and you&amp;#39;ll see the name &amp;quot;Rufus&amp;quot; frequently as well (Rufus is Grubs&amp;#39;s animal companion).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for those interested in &lt;strong&gt;background (instrumental) music,&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve compiled a large number of playlists on Spotify. My Spotify username is smilelaughhold. The playlists I&amp;#39;ve created for RPG session ambiance will have names ending in either &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; (I tend to only play &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; playlists when the party is in combat, but they can be useful for other intense, action-packed situations). As an example, if you search for &amp;quot;ominous travel&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll find the playlist I use to put the party on edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I organize these playlists in folders for easier use, but Spotify has yet to enable the two-way appearance of folder structures so you all won&amp;#39;t see my folder structure, but you can still follow the playlists and create your own folder structure for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;I do plan on sharing videos&lt;/strong&gt; of how I personally use/build my GMing resources and I will post them to Reddit and YouTube in the near future.

I want to focus more on the philosophy behind a religion, ideology, etc and then write the god of that philosophy as the physical embodiment of that philosophy.

What are the most important philosophies to include? How do I create ideologies in my own world that are more complicated than good aligned vs evil aligned? Law vs chaos is better, but imo both axes are generally just motivated by ideologies.

The Paizo gods seem to be built like Greek gods (not always benevolent or all powerful). They seem to build them as characters first, and then assign the domains to them afterwards. Which is a good way to go about it, but I want my pantheon to be more like a set of level 21+ beings worshiped by an increasing number of people due to the ideology that creature popularized. I want to focus more on the philosophy behind a religion, ideology, etc and then write the god of that philosophy as the physical embodiment of that philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the most important philosophies to include? How do I create ideologies in my own world that are more complicated than good aligned vs evil aligned? Law vs chaos is better, but imo both axes are generally just motivated by ideologies.

This seems really punishing since their spell can now be interrupted. Since damage increases a lot faster than your concentration check it seems like a caster being hit will definitely lose their spell at higher levels. Now any competent sorcerer (or what have you) should have defenses up so they aren't easy to hit, but by the same token any competent archer should still be able to peg them at least once with their full round action.   


As I understand it this didn't use to be the case in 3.5e where the rule is likely form, where concentration was a skill and could be increased higher. Do you think this is a reasonable way to balance spontaneous metamagic, because I'd as soon not use it all in this case.   


&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm loath to give 9\^th level casters any more toys, but what about the same situation applied to 6\^th level casters?

Which would be the best way to go about this? I've been looking at an abberrant bloodrager, and a two-handed fighter archetype.

Is one better than the other? Is there a different class I should be looking at instead?

Considering the chain anchor would be wielded 2 handed, the weapon training bonus should apply right? So on single attacks, it'd get weapon training bonus, double strength mod on attack, which would pair well with vital strike, no?

With the bloodrager, I'd have better reach, access to some decent buffs as well, but the damage output would be lower right? Or would the bloodrager do more since it wouldn't depend on single attacks but full attacks?

I was targeting a system that would make radiation less lethal for low level players that bumble into it, but still devastating should one decide to linger, I also wanted a system that allows me to give items that aid radiation sickness as well as magic items with drawbacks that induce radiation sickness. I'm looking for feedback, so here's what I have:

Radiation: The degree of how much radiation a creature has absorbed is represented by the number of Radiation Points a creature has. Radiation Points gained from environmental radiation are gained depending on the degree of severity of radiation in the area, which is detailed below. The number of Radiation Points a creature can gain before increasing is equal to the creature's Base Constitution Score (this is equal to their Constitution Score without any damage or drain accounted for). While affected by radiation, the creature must succeed a Fortitude Saving Throw equal to the DC listed in the table at each frequency interval to negate the listed effects. Once the creature is no longer being irradiated, Radiation Points can be removed naturally at a rate of 1 per hour with a successful saving throw, for every 5 by which the save exceeds the DC, an additional Radiation Point is removed. The minimum Radiation Points a creature can have is zero, the maximum is equal to five times the creature's Base Constitution Score, every Radiation Point gained beyond that number is taken instead as Constitution Damage without a save.

Rad. Level | Rad. per Rnd | Rad. Pts. Range | Fort DC | Dam. per Rnd | Dam. per Hr. | Drain per Day
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Inert | 0 | 1 to BCS | 10 | -- | -- | 1 CON
Low | 1 | BCS+1 to 2xBCS | 13 | 1 CON | 1 STR | 1d4 CON
Moderate | 2 | 2xBCS+1 to 3xBCS | 17 | 1d4 CON | 1d4 STR | 2d4 CON
High | 3 | 3xBCS+1 to 4xBCS | 22 | 2d4 CON | 1d6 STR | 4d6 CON
Severe | 4 | 4xBCS+1 to 5xBCS | 30 | 4d6 CON | 2d6 STR | 6d8 CON

I loosely framed it off the existing Radiation table, but added the Inert category, where a creature is slowly succumbing to CON Drain, but with plenty of hours to overcome the Radiation Points through natural saves, this will hopefully be where most people ""bumble into"" and survive to talk about it.

Below are a couple of mundane items I've drafted up to help combat environmental radiation. I'm planning on introducing items that are similar to Ioun Stones, but irradiate the user slowly (closer to a rate of 1 per minute).

&gt;Podtat Extract: *Drinking this liter of clear fluid forces the imbiber's body to metabolize radiation faster.*

&gt;The imbiber removes 1 Radiation Point by drinking the entire contents of the bottle (an action requiring 1 round to complete), becomes sickened for 1 hour, and makes a DC 5 Fortitude save to avoid falling unconscious for 1d4 hours and nauseated for 1 day. The DC of additional uses of Podtat Extract are increased by 3 for 1 day (this increase stacks). If the imbiber cannot be sickened or nauseated, they gain no benefit from Podtat Extract.

This is intended as cheap solution to irradiation that won't do well halfway through a fight.

&gt;AntiRadioactive: *This syringe is filled with a dubious mix of chemicals made to stabilize radioactive elements in the recipient's body.*

&gt;Administering this requires a Trained DC 10 Heal check as a full-round action, failing this check does not prevent additional checks, but wastes the dosage of AntiRadioactive. The recipient receives an additional save to remove Radiation Points with a +2 bonus. If successful, they remove an additional 2d6 Radiation Points, if unsuccessful they still remove 1 Radiation Point. A single creature can only receive this treatment every 10 minutes. Special: a character with 5 ranks in Heal may increase the DC by 10 to reduce the time between dosages on the target creature to 1 minute.

This is intended as a quick shot for emergencies. Much more expensive than Podtat Extract, but also much more effective.

&gt;Leadweave Suit: *This light armor is interwoven with lead fibers, which prove heavy but offer some protection in hazardous environments.*

&gt;Light Armor, +1 AC, +6 Max DEX, -2 ACP, 10% Spell Failure, 25 lbs

&gt;The lead fibers in this full-body suit allow the wearer to resist environmental radiation. Each suit is made with a rating corresponding to a level of environmental radiation (Low, Moderate, High, or Severe). Against this level or lower, the suit reduces the rate of Radiation Point gain from per Round to per Minute. The suit has no effect against higher radiation levels than its rating and non-environmental radiation sources. The suit can also only absorb a limited amount of radiation before its usefulness is spent. Any given suit can only function for one hour under any amount of environmental radiation (calculated in increments of one minute).

This should offer players protection against radiation, at a potentially hefty cost for more advanced suits. I'm altering how a handful of spells interact with radiation to remove some of the ""instant solutions"" and such. Additionally, I'm adding the following alternative for any Cure spell:

&gt;Any Cure spell can be cast to remove Radiation Points. When cast in this way, no hit points are regained, but instead the target removes a number of Radiation Points equal to twice the spell's level.

I didn't choose all spells because I got lazy, this took hours to build.

I also definitely didn't optimally spend my money (used WBL) and basically just bought 14 +5 weapons.

I realize I wouldn't have that +6 belt to qualify for some of the strength feats right away, but you could always retrain, and I didn't bother with trying to organize it as  a 1-20 build, just an instantaneous level 20 build.

I could probably squeeze out more damage by taking lower stats in mentals just so I can qualify for Titan Grip and Titan Slayer, but that would mean being a much worse caster.

I've been keeping these in mind and weighing them against other options (such as the Oread feat chain Stony Step -&gt; Oread Burrower -&gt; Oread Earth Glider). 

However, once I started comparing the two spells, I started getting very confused. This is what I've read on them so far, and I was hoping someone could maybe explain if I'm missing something in my reasoning. 

Burrow is a **3rd** level spell and gives you a 15 foot burrow speed through loose soil, dirt, sand, and similar (reduced to 10 feet if you're wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying beyond a light load). It also gives you 5 feet burrowing speed through stone, and it lasts 1 **minute**/level. 

Earth Glide is a **4th** level spell that gives you just a flat 5 foot movement speed through dirt, rock, sand, etc.  It also only lasts 1 **round**/level. The only added bonus this spell has that is apparent to me is that it lets you move through lava if you have a way to deal with fire damage. 

Both spells have the clauses about not granting the ability to breathe underground, the user not being able to charge or run, and the user being able to still cast spells and attack. As far as drawbacks, Earth Glide mentions being susceptible to the Move Earth spell and Burrow does not (though I personally think it would apply in both cases anyway). 

The only other difference I can see is that Burrow specifies that loose material collapses behind you after 1 round, whereas Earth Glide makes no such mention, simply stating that there is no apparent tunnel or hole. Given that there isn't too much information about burrow mechanics for Pathfinder, I don't know how to approach that one. 

Bearing all that in mind, is there literally **any** practical reason, sans going through lava, that one would want Earth Glide over Burrow, as far as the spell versions? As far as I can tell, Burrow gives you the same movement speed through stone, better movement speed through everything softer, and lasts for 1 minute/level instead of 1 round/level, **and** it's a lower level spell. Is this just a flaw of the spells' designs, or am I seriously missing something?

A friend more knowledgeable on tabletops than I suggested that it might be that Earth Glide lets you go through worked stone while Burrow does not, but neither spell makes any mention of this, and there are other spells (Soften Earth and Stone, Transmute Rock to Mud) that explicitly refer to worked stone if it's relevant. Plus I can't find anything in the (admittedly sparse) burrowing rules about it either.

I have a small thing I'm trying to clear up since i can't find anything concrete on it.

I am currently building the encounter for the final boss of a one shot I'm doing. Unless the players run in and straight attack there is an opportunity to talk with the boss, an adult blue dragon.

The dragon is mostly just playing villainous conversation with the PCs while slowly moving around as he talks (kind of like Smaug when he was talking to Bilbo in The Hobbit). Really he's just biding time and lining himself up to get a breath attack in that can hit all of the PCs.

I'm thinking of doing either a perception or sense motive check to discern the dragons true intention to abruptly fire a breath attack mid conversation.

On the chance that the PCs don't realize this, for whatever reason, does the dragon firing his breath weapon mid conversation qualify a surprise round? Logically I feel it does since the PCs don't realize he is about to attack suddenly but I'm not so sure RAW.

If not, I'm guessing I just roll initiative normally whenever the dragon decides to make his attack and not worry about doing sense motive or perception check to discern.

Edit: for clarity I would like to say that I'm not trying to upstage the PCs or anything with this move, honestly I'm wanting them to see it coming and have them react. I was just unsure how a situation like this would play out mechanically since most of the time it's ""oh shit a dragon, I attack it.""

Given the replies, it does make more sense to not have the surprise round and instead give a bonus to initiative for the dragon. If the PCs sense motive before the attack and figure out he's trying to line up a shot I'll give them the initiative bonus instead if they declare an attack.

Edit 2: hot damn I did not expect this to gain as much traction as it did. Entire subthreads about what classifies surprise and alternative ways for the dragon to talk while positioning and a debate on if Han shot first. Gotta say, the comments are extremely helpful and majority of you do agree that it's not best to do a surprise round which is perfectly fine for me. I don't want the encounter to be unfair rather I want it to be thematic of a tense standoff where the PCs can either quickly rush the dragon down or hear him out only for him to try to position and attack, I just wasn't sure the best way to go about it, thus this post.

So I've been playing Pathfinder on and off for about two years, but I didn't start getting serious about it (researching builds and whatnot) until this past November. It seems there is a dissonance between how to balance martial classes against magic users, especially during the lower levels, and it ends shutting down any attempts to fix what makes many martials so underpowered in the first place. Sure, there are alternate rules that give martials more comabt utility, like the Spheres of Power, but what if you just want to make a few minor tweaks instead of learning an entirely new system? I'd like to suggest a clause as an attempt to smooth out as much of these disagreements as possible:

""As long as a martial class build does not completely render spellcasting obsolete, or does not possess a feature that the majority of spell casters cannot replicate, it is not broken.""

What this means is that any suggested buffs or revisions to a martial class should be fine, as long as they still allow spellcasters to participate meaningfully in combat. For example, an optimized UC Rogue can deal massive amounts of damage to a single target, with the option of sacrificing damage for combat maneuver debuffs, but your standard wizard can perform party buffs, enemy debuffs, create terrain, summon creatures, deal unqiue types of damage, and temporarily stop combat altogether; an optimized wizard can perform several of these actions via proxies like familiars and constructs. So in spite of the UC Rogue's infamous sneak attack, it still pales in comparison to what the poster child of spellcasters can do. 

That's not to say that the UC Rogue is in need of another upgrade, but let's look at one of the most controversial of the revised classes: the chained monk. Heavily dependent on at least 3 ability scores, it has a revision history marred by an uncertainty of what it's purpose is supposed to be in such a class oriented game, and a inelegant inclusion of an Asian archetype in a European fantasy world. Paizo gave the UC monk a LOT of buffs, but also tried to balance some of these buffs with some questionable design choices, like nerfing the UC monk's base Will save. Let's say someone's homebrewed UC monk kept the chained monk's Will progression. Is increasing its base Will save at level 1 from +0 to +2 gamebreaking? Sure, it gives them the best baseline saves in the game, but it hardly makes them broken; there are over 10 spellcaster classes that can get Resistance as a level 0 spell, and there are plenty of level 1 spells that combat saving conditions. Even when taking into account the UC monk's Flurry of Blows and wide selection of ki powers &amp; style strikes, there is very little that a UC monk can do in combat that a savy and well-equipped martial class can do about as well, let alone complete surpass the spellcasters.

This clause also prevents buffs to martials from entering the same game-breaking tiers as the spellcasters; there's only so much that swinging a sword or shooting a bow should do, after all. For example, let's say someone's homebrewed barbarian had a rage power that refreshed their action economy, effectively giving them two turns worth of actions in one. As powerful as the spellcasters are, they have very little in their collective arsenal that can come close to duplicating this kind of power (namely Time Stop), and even then there are heavy conditions. Thus, this clause strikes down this rage power as broken, with the explanation being that no spellcaster can perform a similar feat.

I'll admit, a lot of my motivation to write this does stem from my frustration with how the monk has been designed, but I didn't write this to rag against spellcasters. I just think there are martial classes that are in need of some new features that could stand to be a little out of the box, and maybe even flat-out powerful mechanically speaking (*cough cough* ranger). I'd love to hear any of your suggestions for how to improve the martial classes, either individually or as a group. Or maybe you're like Mr Rogers and think they are perfect just the way they are; I'd love to know why you think so.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Your martial homebrew or houserule buff can&amp;#39;t be game breaking, because the spellcasters did that already.&lt;/p&gt;

#####Alignment:  LE

####Special Abilities  

Mask Symbiosis (Ex) A spirit oni can be worn as a mask by a willing Small or Medium creature. While worn in this way, the wearer can see through the oni’s eyes and speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate creature, and must detach from its host’s face (as a move action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host’s Perception checks.

Poison (Ex) Gore—injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something relatively unusual—an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own.

Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni mask—this does not require a Craft check or any additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here.

While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them.

When a spirit oni’s master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choices—but the spirit oni’s innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more befitting their egos and desires.

While worn in this way, the wearer can see through the oni’s eyes and speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate creature, and must detach from its host’s face (as a move action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host’s Perception checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poison (Ex) Gore—injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ecology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something relatively unusual—an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni mask—this does not require a Craft check or any additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a spirit oni’s master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choices—but the spirit oni’s innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more befitting their egos and desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Environment:  Any&lt;/h6&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So, they broke in the shop (ignoring the paladin's complains) and they ended up in the Vats area where the mongrelmen were working.

I'm thinking, isn't the law covering things like this? Am I missing something from the book. I mean, sure the alchemists were the real culprits but they still did it illegally.

So my players did the whole Chasing the Skinsaw part a little differently than I think the modules planned for. They went to Magnimar, immediately busted into the Townhouse and found the paper discussing the Seven's Sawmill every Oathday. They all have some sort of disguise magic, so they waited until Oathday to infiltrate the Sawmill. There, they witnessed Justice Ironbriar sacrifice a gambler. Not risking their lives with 12 cultists and Ironbriar, the players decided to follow the two cultists that were disposing of the body. They ambushed them and took them captive, effectively making them their inside men.

The next day, they entered the Sawmill again, disguised as workers and broke into Ironbriar's office. They basically stole all his stuff, set two birds free, then left a dagger in his wall with a poker chip and a note saying ""watch your step"".

They spent the next 7 days deciphering the ledger they found in his office. 

Now, this guy isn't an idiot, neither is Xanesha. They haven't even met Xanesha or know anything about her. So when she learned that someone was on Ironbriar's trail, she decided to have Ironbriar try to relocate the Lord-mayor for ""his own safety"", while she laid low and avoided the Shadow Clock. 

Ironbriar's plan to escort the mayor failed, as the PCs talked to the mayor's assistant and ""convinced"" him to delay the escort. Ironbriar was eventually discovered and arrested. The players went to the Shadowclock, bypassed the Scarecrow and dropped the bells on him. However, I had Xanesha not be there.

I told them were was roughly a few thousand that attacked, and now that they've survived/defeated the army, they want to track it back where it came from to find the source.

As far as I can tell, according to raw, for every 3 creatures the track DC is -1, and for every 24 hours the DC is +1. The other modifiers aren't too important (-1 for including large creatures, maybe +1 for rain/wind(?), etc.)

But clearly, following RAW, if I had \~3000 creatures that means the survival check DC is somewhere near -1000.

Obviously trying to track thousands of footsteps in soft ground like sand dunes would be RIDICULOUSLY easy, you'd probably have to be blind to miss it. HOWEVER, I feel like after some time, or distance following the tracks the dunes would have shifted, wind would have blown, or otherwise hidden the tracks to the point of eventually being entirely erased.

TL;DR: RAW says it's -1000 DC Survival Check to follow tracks of an army \~3000 strong, I'm not sure how much sand dunes/time/weather would effect that and RAW doesn't help very much in this regard.

It had some fliers, some large creatures, some catapults, but the bulk of the force was generic skeletons/zombies/ghouls/etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told them were was roughly a few thousand that attacked, and now that they&amp;#39;ve survived/defeated the army, they want to track it back where it came from to find the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, according to raw, for every 3 creatures the track DC is -1, and for every 24 hours the DC is +1. The other modifiers aren&amp;#39;t too important (-1 for including large creatures, maybe +1 for rain/wind(?), etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clearly, following RAW, if I had ~3000 creatures that means the survival check DC is somewhere near -1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously trying to track thousands of footsteps in soft ground like sand dunes would be RIDICULOUSLY easy, you&amp;#39;d probably have to be blind to miss it. HOWEVER, I feel like after some time, or distance following the tracks the dunes would have shifted, wind would have blown, or otherwise hidden the tracks to the point of eventually being entirely erased.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently took a 200hr Yoga Teacher Training Course. Our final project could be anything. People in the past have done essays, interpretive dances, murals, sculptures... so yeah, anything. I decided I would create a character based on some of the philosophy of a yoga practice. Specifically, the *Yoga Sutras* by Patanjali, with a little bit of extra material from other important figures in yoga history, as well as the teachers of the studio from which I got my certification. I don't know how much overlap there is in the venn diagram of yoga practitioners and Pathfinder players, but I figured some of you might enjoy it. My first ever tabletop campaign (a Pathfinder one) is coming to an end this Friday, so we're rolling new characters soon and this manifesto (of sorts) is what I'll use as a character bible when I make my character sheet and while I'm roleplaying him. I welcome any feedback or suggestions, as 40 sessions does not make me a Pathfinder expert by any means. Also, forgive me for having to explain what Ability Scores, Alignment, etc are-- this is written for those who are familiar with neither yoga nor Tabletop RPGs. Without further introduction, allow me to introduce you to **Vrittag Longspine**.

**Preface**

In approaching this exercise, some concessions must be made. Like all aspects of yoga, there is much left up to interpretation. If one were to take everything as dogma, there could be no effective character in a Pathfinder game. *Ahimsa* is the concept non-violence toward others, and as the very first *Yama*, one might argue that there’s point in continuing. However, there’s simply no fun in that. As a wise man once said, “It depends.” For example, non-violence is only one understanding of *ahimsa*. Another is that it refers to striving towards the least amount of harm. In that sense, some violence is condoned, as long as it is intended to reduce the overall amount of violence.

Is this a matter of mental gymnastics or an exploration into subjectivity? It depends.

**Overall Vision**

Before getting into the nitty gritty of abilities, powers, and race, a basic goal should be determined. As the title suggests, this is an effort to create a Pathfinder character that generally adheres to the philosophy presented in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. While that provides a wealth of options in terms of resource allocation and general characterization, an effort will be made to balance what most honors the Sutras with what most honors the Pathfinder rules and creating an effective character, not just a character. Of course, that necessitates more subjectivity, and that’s where I come in.

Characters in tabletop roleplaying games are not created or played in a vacuum, even when using such an inspiration as the Yoga Sutras. I will do my best to translate the sutras to the character in an honest fashion, but if I thumb the scale every now and then, that’s what makes this character my character, and not just a dry interpretation of source material. The best role-playing characters have humanity and life in them, and that shouldn’t be sacrificed for the sake of objectivity.

As such, my vision for this character is someone who doesn’t want to fight, but must. The character will be male, because while it’s already a challenge enough to translate a host of *Yamas*, *Niyamas*, and *Kleshas* into character traits, I am a male, and respectfully navigating gender politics is not something that will make this easier. He will be succinct with his words, but not gruff, and he will not lie often or well. He will be aloof-- very much in harmony with himself, but lacking many of the social skills needed to have particularly meaningful relationships with others. 

**Class**

This designation describes the archetype that one might generally find in a fantasy setting-- Wizard, Barbarian, Bard, etc.-- and is arguably the most important decision in building a character. The classes each specialize in certain things and have different physical and magical abilities. The one that appears most appropriate for this character is Monk. The first description of this in the Core Rulebook is “For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield-- it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind.” Similarly, yoga may be an approach to fitness for some people, but it is much more than that for some practitioners. It can be the action towards selfless service, the offering of love to the collective world and the divine, and the striving of wisdom towards absolute truth. 

**Ability Scores**

There are six basic attributes that correspond to every character’s raw talent and prowess, and they also branch out to affect individual Skills, such as Diplomacy (Charisma) and Acrobatics (Dexterity). They are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. An argument could be made to prioritize any one of these, but I think the most important one here is Wisdom. While Intelligence is defined by the game as logic and reason, Wisdom governs willpower, awareness, and intuition. Certain classes ‘rely’ on certain abilities more than others-- Fighters need Strength, Bards need Charisma, etc.-- and, fittingly, Monks value Wisdom the most. In the practice of yoga, Wisdom is tied to a litany of ideas from *santosha* (contentment with what one has) to *tapaha* (self-discipline amidst obstacles), but Wisdom also grants a practitioner the ways in which yoga can be more than just a way to sweat and get bendy.

In the hierarchy of how to value these abilities for this character, Strength comes next. Hand to hand fighting is the primary method in which a Monk deals damage, and Strength is tied to that the most. For a yogi, especially one in a vinyasa class, Strength is crucial. Putting one’s body in a series of physically demanding poses requires the muscle to not only develop good form, but the energy leftover to ensure that one’s physical posture is not the only focus.

Constitution measures one’s health and stamina. So many yogic ideas can be associated with this when interpreted as either mental health or taking care of one’s body. *Ahimsa*, for example, means least overall harm, so harm to one’s self certainly falls under that category. Monks, who fight at close range, are on the front lines and thus in the most danger, so durability is obviously important. Additionally, a character’s ability to breath (be it holding breath underwater or suffocating in a room without oxygen) is directly tied to Constitution, which makes its relevance to yoga (via *pranayama*, the control of one’s breath) even more pronounced. 

Notice here how the three most important abilities directly correspond to the three purposes of a yoga practice, as developed by the “father of modern yoga”, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. *Cikitsa* is treatment and therapy. Consider that Constitution is tied to health and well-being, and that it determines how effective your healing attempts are. *Siksha* is fitness, and thus clearly Strength. *Upasana* is personal transformation and spirituality. We’ve gone over how Wisdom relates to several heady concepts that can fall under the umbrella of philosophy and spirituality, but in Pathfinder, Wisdom also translates to a Monk’s ki pool, which is a resource that grants him supernatural energy and the literal ability for personal transformation

The next abilities aren’t unimportant, they simply aren’t valued quite as much as the ones I’ve already covered. Dexterity is agility and speed, neither of which are a big part of yoga practice. A frequent adage in yoga is that, “speed masks weakness”. Flowing through a sequence of poses in a quick manner allows one’s body to conceal the fact that they might not be able to fully express some or all of those poses over an extended timeframe. Intelligence (logic and reason) can sometimes lead to rigid ways of thinking about things, and in realms where philosophy, magic, and flexibility (both bodily and mental), such constrictions can be less than ideal. Charisma, which is the stat that determines personality and personal magnetism. Again, yoga doesn’t eschew Charisma by any means, but the idea of a yoga practitioner who is aloof or stoic (as opposed to a social butterfly) is not exactly a brand new stereotype.

**Race**

The Rulebook states, “... the races of [Pathfinder] are a diverse mix of cultures, sizes, attitudes, and appearances.” From a perspective of game mechanics, this means that different races are granted inherent traits and bonuses/penalties. Half-orcs are prone to losing their temper in bouts of rage, and Humans are particularly multi-talented and can specialize in any number of things. Dwarves are known for being wise, tough, and stoic, which translates to a bonus in Wisdom and Constitution, and a penalty in Charisma, all of which is right in line with our yogi.

**Skills**

While Abilities are basic attributes, Skills refer to specific actions your character can take in and out of combat. They include things like Intimidate, Disguise, and Swim. A player can allocate resources to make these actions more successful. The two that stand out to me are Acrobatics and Perception. Acrobatics refers to the physical grace and balance with which one controls one’s body, which, in terms of yoga, are crucial. (There is also a game mechanic called “Wisdom in the Flesh” where I can use my Wisdom score to improve a Skill, which would be Acrobatics, which might be the most synergistic idea in this entire outline.) Perception allows one to notice fine details through the five senses. Three things commonly worked on in a yoga class are proprioception (sense of where you are in space), interoception (sense of where you are internally, meaning digestion, breath, etc.), and neuroception (sense of what is safe/dangerous/life-threatening). Beyond a etymological connection, these ideas are very closely linked and thus should be prioritized. Other skills that seem appropriate are Stealth (very rarely in yoga do we make noise unintentionally) and Knowledge of Religion, which I’d define as knowledge of spirituality.

**Alignment**

One of the last major decisions regards a character’s position on the two spectrums of morality and rules. Morality is the sliding scale of Good vs. Evil. Good people protect innocent life, whereas Evil people kill indiscriminately, whether for money or fun. Clearly, our character, a follower of *ahimsa*, would fall under Good. The other spectrum is that of Lawful vs. Chaotic. Lawful people honor traditions and respect authority, whereas Chaotic people are nebulous and generally spurn tradition and authority. Someone abiding by principles and ideas that have been around for thousands of years would, without question, be considered Lawful. 

**Character Bio**

Born into a family of warriors, Vrittag grew up learning how to fight. His years of training developed his martial prowess, but he eventually became disillusioned with violence and decided to live his life as a peaceful monk. This decision caused a schism with his family and he moved away to make his life easier. He eventually found a home with a frontier community where he farms produce. He keeps his mind sharp and his body fit by meditating frequently and is more comfortable with animals and nature than with other people.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the last major decisions regards a character’s position on the two spectrums of morality and rules. Morality is the sliding scale of Good vs. Evil. Good people protect innocent life, whereas Evil people kill indiscriminately, whether for money or fun. Clearly, our character, a follower of &lt;em&gt;ahimsa&lt;/em&gt;, would fall under Good. The other spectrum is that of Lawful vs. Chaotic. Lawful people honor traditions and respect authority, whereas Chaotic people are nebulous and generally spurn tradition and authority. Someone abiding by principles and ideas that have been around for thousands of years would, without question, be considered Lawful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born into a family of warriors, Vrittag grew up learning how to fight. His years of training developed his martial prowess, but he eventually became disillusioned with violence and decided to live his life as a peaceful monk. This decision caused a schism with his family and he moved away to make his life easier. He eventually found a home with a frontier community where he farms produce. He keeps his mind sharp and his body fit by meditating frequently and is more comfortable with animals and nature than with other people. &lt;/p&gt;

We are level 2 and just made a total of \~50 GP so far... to alleviate the DM (he's new at DMing) I decided to pick up Craft Wondrous Item (after speaking to him about it) and later Craft Arms and Armor to make loot a bit easier on him.

Bracers of Twinned Assault

Aura: Moderate Evocation; CL 7th

Slot: Bracers; Price 56000 GP

As a swift action while wielding a melee weapon in their main hand, the wearer of this item can create a ghostly duplicate of the wielded weapon in their off-hand. The duplicate weapon functions in all ways as the original, including enhancement bonuses, special abilities, and materials, but is treated as a light weapon for the purposes of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat (and any feats or abilities that list Two-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite). If the original or duplicate weapon leaves the wielder's grasp, the duplicate weapon vanishes at the end of turn.

2). He has magical lineage for shocking grasp, which he is telling me is now a level 0 spell. Does he actually have unlimited uses of this spell as an orison?

3). I've run into a problem now where I am trying to balance the encounters.  My first thing I've done is maxing the HP of all my creatures.

My main PF group are starting a new campaign this weekend based around Year of The Sky Key. There are potentially going to be 6 PCs, but only 3 of the party are coming this time around due to scheduling conflicts. 

People who have seen my posts as of late would probably have noticed that I have been waiting in unwavering hype these past 6ish months for this campaign to start, mostly due to my excitement in using my Investigator. 

My obvious, burning fervour aside, I need some help with utilising my character.

I'm coming into the campaign with a Dayborn Dhampir Bonded Investigator accompanied by a Dove familiar that will be using the Raven as a template (if anyone has an alternative template that they feel is much more useful than Raven and that I can flavour as a Dove, please please let me know).

We're starting at level 5 and I have never played with an animal companion before. I know my familiar will get sort of better with Improved Familiar and Inspired Familiar, but a bird is nothing really special. 

Are there ways for me, both in and out of combat, to utilise my familiar? 

Extra thing to note: I have taken a one-level dip in Inspire Blade Swashbuckler so my Investigator levels are technically at 4 at the moment. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is both a &amp;#39;woohoo so excited&amp;#39; post and also an advice-seeking one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main PF group are starting a new campaign this weekend based around Year of The Sky Key. There are potentially going to be 6 PCs, but only 3 of the party are coming this time around due to scheduling conflicts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have seen my posts as of late would probably have noticed that I have been waiting in unwavering hype these past 6ish months for this campaign to start, mostly due to my excitement in using my Investigator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My obvious, burning fervour aside, I need some help with utilising my character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m coming into the campaign with a Dayborn Dhampir Bonded Investigator accompanied by a Dove familiar that will be using the Raven as a template (if anyone has an alternative template that they feel is much more useful than Raven and that I can flavour as a Dove, please please let me know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re starting at level 5 and I have never played with an animal companion before. I know my familiar will get sort of better with Improved Familiar and Inspired Familiar, but a bird is nothing really special. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there ways for me, both in and out of combat, to utilise my familiar? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra thing to note: I have taken a one-level dip in Inspire Blade Swashbuckler so my Investigator levels are technically at 4 at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm really hoping I get a definitive answer to this one; I've been driving myself mad trying to find a hard line in any of the rules to confirm or deny the following;

Our DM is under the impression that you can't make melee touch attacks without provoking an attack of opportunity, **unless** you have Improved Unarmed Strike. I disagree.

I have already clarified with him that the act of delivering a touch spell ie Shocking Grasp, does not provoke as the delivering creature is considered to be proficient with melee touch attacks. It was hampering our casters a fair old bit and caused a couple of near-deaths (of which my pasty Wizard was one). But the instance from which this latest grudge arose from our Bard's fun new spell, *Sonic Form,* which states that while she's under its effects, *""You can make a melee touch attack once per round that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage + 1 point per caster level.""*

Now, from my point of view - a self-confessed rules lawyer, and not a very good one either (I get VERY excited) - I know that the Unarmed Strike rules specifically call out the need for Improved Unarmed Strike to avoid provocation.

The only information I can find regarding non-spell melee touch attacks, however, are the rules for things like a Shadow's Incorporeal Touch ability, which do not provoke attacks, have no access to Improved Unarmed Strike, aren't using a natural weapon to deliver it (there is no ""claw"" or ""bite"", just ""incorporeal touch""), and reads as essentially the same basic mechanic; Roll to hit touch AC, deliver d6 + whatever damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a concrete rule I can refer to? Our Bard loves her new spell and she doesn't like getting smacked in the face for playing according to the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Gratefully,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However brawler itself says that:

&amp;#x200B;

This is not modified at all by the Exemplar archtype.

&amp;#x200B;

Monk's Robe says:   
""When worn, this simple brown robe confers great ability in unarmed combat. If the wearer has levels in monk, her AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-Level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like the monk’s AC bonus.""

&amp;#x200B;

Which I would take to mean that as a brawler, I would get to count my brawler levels as monk levels for the purpose of this item, and get the monk's unarmed damage progression for my current level exemplar brawler level +5 and also get to the monk's AC for my current level +5, despite both of these abilities being otherwise lost by my archtype?

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously wouldn't get any other abilities that might normally come along with them, such as the free Improved Unarmed Strike feat, so those would have to be obtained elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this track or am I messing up my reasoning somewhere?

Hey guys! I am fan of necromancers, but in pathfinder no class really makes feel like you are a master of the undead. So in this class you have some solid features that already exist from other classes with a sprinkle of features that i made myself.

Have a look and tell me what you guys think!!!


Ultimate Necromancer


Prerequisits: 
Knowledge Arcana, Religion, Spellcraft, Use Magic Device 5

Class Features
The following are class features of the lord of the dead prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ultimate Necromancers gain no new proficiencies with any armor or weapons.

Spells per Day
When a Ultimate Necromancer gains a level, he gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of Ultimate Necromancer to the level of whatever other spellcasting class he has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a Ultimate Necromancer, he must choose which class he adds each Ultimate Necromancer level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Aligned Class Feature (Ex)
At 1st level, the Ultimate Necromacer must choose a class he belonged to before adding the prestige class, then select a feature he already possessed to be his aligned class feature. He gains all the benefits of having this feature through the entirety of the prestige class. Eg. If a Magus 5/Ultimate Necomancer 1 were to pick his Spell Combat feature, as he progresses through being a Ultimate Necromancer if Spell Were to improve at all if he were to stay a magus, then it still will improve.

Inspired Necromancy (Ex)
When determining the maximum number of Hit Dice of undead he can control with spells like animate dead, a character counts his Ultimate Necromancer levels twice. This ability does not factor into how many undead he can create with a single casting of a spell. Thus, a cleric 7/Ultimate Necromancer 3 would be able to control 52 Hit Dice worth of undead with Animate Dead, lesser or Animate Dead.

Secrets of Death (Ex)
At 2rd level and 2nd level thereafer, an Ultimate Necromancer gains new insights into the dark arts of necromancy. At the time he gains this ability, the character may add a necromancy spell that is not normally a part of his class’s spell list to his spell list. For example, an Ultimate Necromancer with levels of wizard might choose to add spells like death watch, inflict critical wounds, and slay living to his spell list, while an Ultimate Necromancer with levels of cleric might choose to add spells such as enervation, magic jar, and vampiric touch. An Ultimate Necromancer may choose to add spells he cannot yet cast—this does not allow the Ultimate Necromancer to cast spells of a higher level than he normally could, but rather merely grants him access to those spells when he reaches the level required to cast them.

Necropolitan (Ex)
An Ultimate Necromancer gains a bonus equal to his Ultimate Necromancer level (minimum +1) on Diplomacy and Knowledge checks regarding undead creatures. Because of his obsessive focus on the undead, he takes a –2 penalty when attempting such checks regarding living creatures.

Undead Mastery:
All undead creatures created by a Ultimate Necromancer of at least 3rd level gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 1 additional hit point per Hit Die. In addition, the Ultimate Necromancer's limit for controlling creatures created by the Animate dead,lesser or Animate Dead spells increases by an amount equal to half of the spellcasting ability modifier possessed by the class before becoming an Ultimate Necromancer. (Eg. Charisma for Bards, Sorcerer, and Oracles Intelligence for Wizards, Arcanists, and Magi, and Wisdom for Clerics and Warpriests.) Enhancing undead in this manner can not stack with the effects of the Descecrate Spell, except of doubling the HD limit for a single casting of Animate Dead, lesser and Animate Dead.

At 5th level this bonus increases to +4 Strength and Dexterity, +2 hitpoints per hit die and the Ultimate Necromancer adds his entire spellcasting ability modifier to each caster level of her control limit instead of half.

At 7th level this bonus increases to +6 Strength and Dexterity, +3 hit points per HD and the Ultimate Necromancer adds 1.5 times her spellcasting ability modifier to the number of HD of undead per caster level that she can control. 

At 9th level this bonus increases to +8 Strength and Dexterity, +4 hit points per HD and the Ultimate Necromancer adds twice her spellcasting modifier to the number of HD of undead per caster level that she can control. 

Spawn Mastery (Su)
At 4th level, whenever a lord of the dead would create a free-willed undead, that undead is instead under the lord of the dead’s control. A lord of the dead can control up to 4 HD of undead per lord of the dead level in this manner. Excess undead are free-willed unless previously controlled undead are released.

Undead Manipulator (Ex)
At 6th level, the Ultimate Necromancer gains great insight into the minds and necromantic forces controlling undead creatures. An Ultimate Necromancer’s spells and spell-like abilities with mind-affecting effects treat undead creatures as their original type. Thus, an Ultimate Necromancer can use charm person against a humanoid zombie or confusion against a horde of skeletal champions.

Death’s Shroud (Su)
At 8th level, he learns how to cloak his true intentions, gaining the ability to use nondetection or undetectable alignment once per day. The caster level for this ability is equal to the Ultimate Necromancer’s highest caster level.

Undeath Initiate (Ex)
At 10th level, an Ultimate Necromancer has prepared his body and mind for the transition into undeath. He gains a +5 bonus on any ability check, skill check, or saving throw related to the process of transforming into an undead creature. This bonus can be used on any check related to becoming a creature like a lich (the process of which is largely left up to the GM’s discretion). Additionally, if slain by an undead creature with the create spawn ability, the agent of death retains his Intelligence (regardless of the type of undead he is transformed into) and free will (he is never under the control of the creature that killed him). Unless otherwise noted by the undead creature’s create spawn ability, the newly created undead Ultimate Necromancer loses all of his class levels. This makes transformation into a lich and vampire among the most appealing options for an Ultimate Necromancer seeking undeath.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I am fan of necromancers, but in pathfinder no class really makes feel like you are a master of the undead. So in this class you have some solid features that already exist from other classes with a sprinkle of features that i made myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look and tell me what you guys think!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimate Necromancer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisits: 
Knowledge Arcana, Religion, Spellcraft, Use Magic Device 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class Features
The following are class features of the lord of the dead prestige class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ultimate Necromancers gain no new proficiencies with any armor or weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spells per Day
When a Ultimate Necromancer gains a level, he gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of Ultimate Necromancer to the level of whatever other spellcasting class he has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a Ultimate Necromancer, he must choose which class he adds each Ultimate Necromancer level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligned Class Feature (Ex)
At 1st level, the Ultimate Necromacer must choose a class he belonged to before adding the prestige class, then select a feature he already possessed to be his aligned class feature. He gains all the benefits of having this feature through the entirety of the prestige class. Eg. If a Magus 5/Ultimate Necomancer 1 were to pick his Spell Combat feature, as he progresses through being a Ultimate Necromancer if Spell Were to improve at all if he were to stay a magus, then it still will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired Necromancy (Ex)
When determining the maximum number of Hit Dice of undead he can control with spells like animate dead, a character counts his Ultimate Necromancer levels twice. This ability does not factor into how many undead he can create with a single casting of a spell. Thus, a cleric 7/Ultimate Necromancer 3 would be able to control 52 Hit Dice worth of undead with Animate Dead, lesser or Animate Dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets of Death (Ex)
At 2rd level and 2nd level thereafer, an Ultimate Necromancer gains new insights into the dark arts of necromancy. At the time he gains this ability, the character may add a necromancy spell that is not normally a part of his class’s spell list to his spell list. For example, an Ultimate Necromancer with levels of wizard might choose to add spells like death watch, inflict critical wounds, and slay living to his spell list, while an Ultimate Necromancer with levels of cleric might choose to add spells such as enervation, magic jar, and vampiric touch. An Ultimate Necromancer may choose to add spells he cannot yet cast—this does not allow the Ultimate Necromancer to cast spells of a higher level than he normally could, but rather merely grants him access to those spells when he reaches the level required to cast them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necropolitan (Ex)
An Ultimate Necromancer gains a bonus equal to his Ultimate Necromancer level (minimum +1) on Diplomacy and Knowledge checks regarding undead creatures. Because of his obsessive focus on the undead, he takes a –2 penalty when attempting such checks regarding living creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undead Mastery:
All undead creatures created by a Ultimate Necromancer of at least 3rd level gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 1 additional hit point per Hit Die. In addition, the Ultimate Necromancer&amp;#39;s limit for controlling creatures created by the Animate dead,lesser or Animate Dead spells increases by an amount equal to half of the spellcasting ability modifier possessed by the class before becoming an Ultimate Necromancer. (Eg. Charisma for Bards, Sorcerer, and Oracles Intelligence for Wizards, Arcanists, and Magi, and Wisdom for Clerics and Warpriests.) Enhancing undead in this manner can not stack with the effects of the Descecrate Spell, except of doubling the HD limit for a single casting of Animate Dead, lesser and Animate Dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 5th level this bonus increases to +4 Strength and Dexterity, +2 hitpoints per hit die and the Ultimate Necromancer adds his entire spellcasting ability modifier to each caster level of her control limit instead of half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 7th level this bonus increases to +6 Strength and Dexterity, +3 hit points per HD and the Ultimate Necromancer adds 1.5 times her spellcasting ability modifier to the number of HD of undead per caster level that she can control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9th level this bonus increases to +8 Strength and Dexterity, +4 hit points per HD and the Ultimate Necromancer adds twice her spellcasting modifier to the number of HD of undead per caster level that she can control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spawn Mastery (Su)
At 4th level, whenever a lord of the dead would create a free-willed undead, that undead is instead under the lord of the dead’s control. A lord of the dead can control up to 4 HD of undead per lord of the dead level in this manner. Excess undead are free-willed unless previously controlled undead are released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undead Manipulator (Ex)
At 6th level, the Ultimate Necromancer gains great insight into the minds and necromantic forces controlling undead creatures. An Ultimate Necromancer’s spells and spell-like abilities with mind-affecting effects treat undead creatures as their original type. Thus, an Ultimate Necromancer can use charm person against a humanoid zombie or confusion against a horde of skeletal champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death’s Shroud (Su)
At 8th level, he learns how to cloak his true intentions, gaining the ability to use nondetection or undetectable alignment once per day. The caster level for this ability is equal to the Ultimate Necromancer’s highest caster level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeath Initiate (Ex)
At 10th level, an Ultimate Necromancer has prepared his body and mind for the transition into undeath. He gains a +5 bonus on any ability check, skill check, or saving throw related to the process of transforming into an undead creature. This bonus can be used on any check related to becoming a creature like a lich (the process of which is largely left up to the GM’s discretion). Additionally, if slain by an undead creature with the create spawn ability, the agent of death retains his Intelligence (regardless of the type of undead he is transformed into) and free will (he is never under the control of the creature that killed him). Unless otherwise noted by the undead creature’s create spawn ability, the newly created undead Ultimate Necromancer loses all of his class levels. This makes transformation into a lich and vampire among the most appealing options for an Ultimate Necromancer seeking undeath.&lt;/p&gt;

Tinker (+2 racial), Toxicologist class feature (+2 untyped), Master Alchemist feat (+2 untyped), Skill Focus Craft Alchemy feat (+3 untyped), Cooperative Crafting from Tumor Familiar w/Valet archetype (+2 circumstance), Alchemical Adept (+2 trait), Torble tumor familiar (+2 untyped, Alchemy class feature (+5 Competency bonus, based on lvl 5), Crafter's Fortune (+5 Luck, assume reliable source of this). This brings things to a +25 to Craft Alchemy. Add in 5 ranks, int mod +4, and +3 for class skill, we're rocking a cool +37 to Craft Alchemy.

For how much one can craft in a day, the base amount is \[DC\]\*\[Roll Result\]/\[7 days a week\] in silver. Assuming we do a Take 10 for the craft checks, have an unlimited source of Crafter's fortune, and decide to craft Hydroflouric Acid using a +10 to the DC for Accelerated Crafting, you get 201.4 sp per day.

But! Swift Alchemy kicks that up a notch to 402.9 sp per day \[not rounding until the final result\] from doubling crafting speed

And! The Valet tumor familiar's cooperative crafting doubles that up to 805.7 sp per day

Then! Master Alchemist turns that progress from SP to GP, giving you 805.7 gp per day

Finally! Since Hydroflouric Acid is a poison, Master Alchemist will give you 4 \[Int Mod\] doses when you finish making one dose \[though you must pay the full cost of the four doses\]

Since the crafting cost is 833.34 gp \[1/3\*2500\] for Hydroflouric Acid, in two full crafting days you would make 4 doses of Hydroflouric Acid for 3333.36 gp

####Appearance  

This humanoid is covered in shaggy fur and carries a heavy axe in one of his clawed hands.

####CR   4
#####Alignment:  LG
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Change Shape (Su) All lycanthropes have three forms—a humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and animal form. A natural lycanthrope can shift to any of its three alternate forms as a move-equivalent action. An afflicted lycanthrope can assume animal or hybrid form as a full-round action by making a DC 15 Constitution check, or humanoid form as a full-round action by making a DC 20 Constitution check. On nights when the full moon is visible, an afflicted lycanthrope gains a +5 morale bonus to Constitution checks made to assume animal or hybrid form, but a –5 penalty to Constitution checks made to assume humanoid form. An afflicted lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise, or after 8 hours of rest, whichever comes first. A slain lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. 

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A natural lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope, this ability has no effect.

Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) In any form, natural lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with animals related to their animal form. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. Afflicted lycanthropes only gain this ability in animal or hybrid form. 


#####  
*****
####Ecology  

A creature that catches lycanthropy becomes an afflicted lycanthrope, but shows no symptoms (and does not gain any of the template's adjustments or abilities) until the night of the next full moon, when the victim involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity. The character remains in animal form until the next dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he makes a DC 20 Will save, in which case he becomes aware of his condition. 

A remove disease or heal spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting lycanthrope's attack. Alternatively, consuming a dose of wolfsbane (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560) gives an afflicted lycanthrope a new Fortitude save to recover from lycanthropy.

&amp;#x200B;

So my thoughts were either:

1: Forgo the whole lance approach, given the huge +4 bonus to dex you get as a goblin, go with lighter weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

2:It looks to be possible to get lances to use dex for all their stats, but it does require an enchantment and some heavy feat investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Will get you lances with weapon finesse.  Spear dancing style (one of the pre-reqs) lets you choose your polearm (lance in this case) and gives it an off-hand attack of a light mace.

&amp;#x200B;

With the polearm chosen as the spear dancing style you get the weapon finesse feat for it as well as part of Spear dancing spiral, letting you use Dex instead of STR for your attack rolls.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, with  [http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/agile/](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/agile/) 

on a lance, you can use your Dex for the damage as well.  Although it normally doesn't apply to two-handed weapons.  The lance specifically states that while mounted you can wield it in one hand.

[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance/](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance/)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall a heavy feat investment (5 feats), but I would buff up my lance quite a bit in the process and could use it with an off-hand attack while dismounted making it effectively the only weapon you'd need to carry.

&amp;#x200B;

I could take two-weapon fighting first (which would be useful generally)

Then dip one level into fighter for the extra combat feat at level 2, letting me take weapon finesse on whatever one-handed weapon I'm planning on using

Level 3 one more fighter level for the extra feat, plus the feat I get for being level 3, letting me take weapon focus for the lance and spear dancing style for the last of the pre-req's.

Level 4-5 in cavalier for, and at 5th level I get my last needed feat which I used to take spear dancing spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

By that time I should be able to get stuff enchanted and agile only costs what a +1 enchant should be, so it should be affordable.

Feel free to skip the following unless you want to know why I'm attached to such an obscure deity.

Character reasons my guy worships Osiris: he's a samsaran, so his memories of being an Osiriani cleric of osiris are surprisingly powerful this life. Moreover he kinda got screwed over on this life and just wants to move on, but he's caught in his cycle of rebirth. Since Osiris is the god of death, rebirth, and the afterlife, my character is hoping by pleasing Osiris specifically in his pursuit of harmony that he'll stop the whole rebirth thing and let him move on to the afterlife. 

Also he has the plant domain which means my theurge could qualify for the spontaneous nature's ally feat, which I just think is cool. I see my samsaran as being so jumbled up with his magical past lives that different aspects of his past affect his current abilites. I like thinking he was a druid sometime in the past and so that feat would make for great flavor. Plus the whole plant thing goes with his attitude of ""there is a season for everything"", being willing to let things die and grow for both have a purpose, etc. He'll probably be spouting a bunch of harvest related metaphors.

So to protect against me cherry picking things that just help my character, I want to ask the community what they think this ancient Osirian deity would ask and give for the deific obedience feat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip the following unless you want to know why I&amp;#39;m attached to such an obscure deity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character reasons my guy worships Osiris: he&amp;#39;s a samsaran, so his memories of being an Osiriani cleric of osiris are surprisingly powerful this life. Moreover he kinda got screwed over on this life and just wants to move on, but he&amp;#39;s caught in his cycle of rebirth. Since Osiris is the god of death, rebirth, and the afterlife, my character is hoping by pleasing Osiris specifically in his pursuit of harmony that he&amp;#39;ll stop the whole rebirth thing and let him move on to the afterlife. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also he has the plant domain which means my theurge could qualify for the spontaneous nature&amp;#39;s ally feat, which I just think is cool. I see my samsaran as being so jumbled up with his magical past lives that different aspects of his past affect his current abilites. I like thinking he was a druid sometime in the past and so that feat would make for great flavor. Plus the whole plant thing goes with his attitude of &amp;quot;there is a season for everything&amp;quot;, being willing to let things die and grow for both have a purpose, etc. He&amp;#39;ll probably be spouting a bunch of harvest related metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;

####Appearance  

Its flesh pallid and a parchment burial prayer hanging from its brow, this risen corpse lurches forward in a series of short hops.


####CR   6
#####Alignment:  LE
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Brutal Claws (Ex): A jiang-shi’s nails are brutally sharp and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19–20 and grant the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks.

Drain Chi (Su): Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains “chi,” or life energy, from a victim’s breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim’s breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. 

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Jiang-shis (often known as “hopping vampires”) are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the exhaled life energy of the living. A jiang-shi’s appearance is based on the state of the creature’s corpse at the time of its reanimation. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally, each has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches; originally intended to protect the body from restless spirits, this scroll grants a jiang-shi immunity to magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and wands.

A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not leave its corpse at the time of death, and is instead allowed to fester and putrefy within. At some point during the body’s decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque form and seeks living creatures to feed upon.

She did the adventure that has the druid shrine in it, and she befriended Baggle.  They are now a druidic pair, and they are going through the area adding druid shrines.

She wanted a magical effect similar to the magical shrine in the module.  I told her she couldn't get a force field at her low level (level 6).  However, what she wanted was a small spring with clean water and what we are affectionately calling, *Goodberry Bush.*

So here is how I did it.  I told her the magic item creation rules will allow her to have the 0-level Create Water as a continuous effect for 1000 GP.  This works like the lowest setting on Decanter of Endless Water.  We have a nearby stream, so the water can runoff into that stream.

Next I told her that she could create a custom spell called *Goodberry Bush* at 3rd level.  This spell will imbue a bush with goodberry growth as per the spell (a few berries/day) but I said the magic would expire after days/level or weeks/level (I couldn't figure out a reasonable ramping up of the 1st level *Goodberry* spell).  What we end up doing was the Permanency spell, kinda.  We found a cost that matched the other spells of 1st level (2500), and said she could get a bush to work Goodberry if she was willing to pay.  We also made up a compromise where she would pay only 1000 GP and have the effect on the bush for 1 year, or multiples of 1000 for multiple years.

Finally, we also agreed that for the same price (2500 GP, as per a 1st level spell made permanent) she could get an Endure Elements effect on her shrine that would keep it nice year-round.

Together this is a bit pricey, but she's asking if it's possible to make around 20 of these shrines by level 12, and I'm thinking she'll easily afford it if she stays on wealth by level.

The rules for adding spells to spellbook say it takes the following to add spells to a wizard's spellbook from a spellbook/scroll:

* Deciphering the magical writing
* Spend 1 hour studying the spell
* Make a spellcraft check to see if they understand the spell
* Spend 1 hour per spell level (cantrips 30 minutes) to record the spell

Simple enough (I guess.)

So my question is this: if I hand-wave the times and just allow a caster to pay the money and move on, am I really breaking anything other than immersion?

So far, I've done I think two-fifths to half of all CRB's spells, and I'm starting to regret starting this very tedious project.

For art, I've primarily used www.mtgpics.com , along with some google image search voodoo.

I'm planning on making one huge set with all spells included, having the class spell levels on the bottom of the card (B3D3SW4 for Bard 3,Druid 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, for example), and then transferring the appropriate cards to separate class decks, so I can put the spell level in the top corner for a clearer overview.

Please tell me I've not sunk a big piece of my precious time into something no-one cares for!

Also, I really want to have this printed and laminated when I'm finished, does anyone have some advice on how to approach that? I'm in the EU, btw, before you suggest specific store chains.

Thanks for your time!

EDIT: so it looks like you all love this! Thanks for the praise and feedback, I really appreciate it!

My friends and their respective partners and I recently decided to play Pathfinder 1E together. We are running Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition, with me as the GM.

Right now, we are planning to play live sessions and we even had session 0 this previous night and the results of which have left me concerned for what will happen in live sessions in the future, mainly chatter and tangents and the like. I realize the advice will be ""be stricter, make them cut the chatter"", but I also have some concerns regarding player anxiety and dead spots in the live scenario. We're all friends here wanting to have a good time, so I would rather not foist any unnecessary complication on the matter.

Player anxiety aside, I also get anxious and lost in the information sometimes when live sessions are happening and I am not confident in my ability to work with it live as opposed to being able to type and create and tell a story that way-- a method I am much more competent in. There are also scheduling concerns.

So I want to ask: does anybody have any advice running the game as a play-by-post (PBP)? I would like for people to be able to post throughout the day.

My main concerns are running combat encounters and dungeon crawls, given the spacial aspects of Pathfinder's mechanics.

* If you're also wielding a manufactured weapon, all natural attacks are secondary, so they take a -5 penalty.

I've played a one-off demo game at a con, now I'm itching to run it, although I'm slightly intimidated by the crunch.

Might you, anonymous users of the interwebs, have any advice specifically to DMing 2e Pathfinder? Or any useful resources for random encounter/loot/map creation?

I own a hardcover copy of the playtest book. I'm half-tempted to rewrite/houserule some parts of it, related to spell casting (make more spells benefit from multi-action casting) and magic item use and resonance. That part seemed a little half-baked.

For the general breakdown, its listed as a Universal Item under the Psionic Items. It states that anyone can use a universal psionic item. Its a psychoactive skin that goes over the top layer of armor and you can have up to 3 of them but only the top layer is active, switching layers is a standard action. 

**Skin of the proteus** Continually affects the wearers as the metamorphosis power. While in a form other then his natural form, the wearer does not appear to be wearing the skin. 

**Metamorphosis** 

Manifesting time 1 standard action.

Power Points 5

As minor metamorphosis, except you instead gain one option from enhancement menu B or one option from abilities menu B. Choices that give similar benefits to those from enhancement menu B or abilities menu B do not stack.

**Enhancement B**


Increase str, dex, or con by 4

Increase size by two categories

Decrease size by two categories

Pick 3 choices from enhancement A

Increase land speed by 20 feet.

**Abilities menu B** 

Gain 2 natural attacks

Gain fast healing 2

Gain +3 to your natural armor bonus

Gain 20 temp hit points

Gain Imp. Crit with natural weapons

Gain damage reduction 5/magic

Gain a fly speed of 20 ft (poor)

Gain a poison attack

Spit poison as an RTA

Gain a swim speed of 40 ft

Climb speed of 40 ft

Burrow speed of 30 ft

Gain 3 choices from abilities Menu A.

**Augment** You can augment this power in the following ways.

1. For every 4 power points you spend, you gain one choice from Enhancement menu B and once choice from abilities B, you may not choose the same option twice.

2. For every 2 power points you spend you gain one choice from Enhancement Menu A and once choice from Abilities Menu A from minor metamorphosis. You may not choose the same option twice.  



So for a player that's a non-psionic using this item, is there a pool of power points they are given for this? Is the power points listed burned every time they change their skin from different enhancements? IE they need 5 points to equip it and then spend another 4 points to get the basic powers? If they switch forms at any point does that use up another 4 points? How do they get those points back?

I’m looking for drawbacks or limiting factors. It seems like this could be used as a ""cheap"" and universal wild shape for mobility purposes. No rope? Fly or climb. Fence to tall? Burrow. Its in the water guarded by anti-aircraft mage towers? Swim around it. So whats the catch with this item?

She has stated that I am only allowed to use spells and spell-likes of level 6 and below however, so unfortunately we can't just wish an island in. I've explored certain avenues of creating our islands but I've been running into a lot of obstacles.

I've explored several avenues so far. The first of which is stone shape and move earth. Neither really work however.

* At caster level 10, move earth can shift 12000 cubic feet of stone an hour
* Move earth can shift  225000 cubic feet of stone an hour

From cursory calculations taking 2.7 miles as the average depth of an ocean (taken from the real world) we can build a chunk of land 60\*60 ft wide at water level. To build an island of any size whatsoever, this will require literally years which, due to the race of about half the party, we probably can't afford.The second avenue I tried to explore was using earth and magma elemental to burrow into the oceanic basalt and artificially create a volcanic event to forcefully form an island. This may well take years as well, but the resulting island will be far larger and rich in nutritious soil and not basically a giant pillar. The elemental doesn't need to breathe, doesn't need to sleep, and will be immune to any heat from the resulting volcanic event. The problem with this however is that the magma elemental has earth glide rather than standard tunneling which may become an issue.

The third avenue I tried to explore was that I could try to do is to buy a gate scroll and send in things to dig out the entirety of the elemental plane of earth onto the material plane. This will, of course, probably upset the denizens of the elemental plane of earth and take a fair amount of time and resources as well. It may end up being the best option if no other options presents itself however.So then here's my question to everyone. What options are actually available for excavating and moving enough land to actually create an island out of basically nothing assuming access to the wizard and cleric spell lists?

A friend of mine (who is new to PF but not RPGs in general) is a fan of ghost stories and wants to play a spiritualist.  As I was unfamiliar with the class, in researching phantoms, I didn't see anything to indicate how they are chosen.  While I would guess that the player chooses them similar to how a summoner chooses an eidolon, I came up with an interesting twist on how it could happen.

I figured that in addition to the phantom assisting the player, at the same time the player is trying to help the phantom ""move on"" into the spirit realm.  As such, at first level, the phantom that is attached to the spiritualist is chosen at random.  Then, throughout the adventure, anytime either the phantom or the spiritualist (while housing the phantom in his consciousness) rolls a natural 20 on one of the phantom's associated skills, that skill is considered ""fulfilled"".  Once both skills have been fulfilled, the spiritualist has the option to release the phantom from his service; it can now ""move on"" to the afterlife.  The next day, when the spiritualist performs ""morning maintenance"" it gains a new phantom at random.

To me this is in line with how a phantom is kept on the material plane by their powerful emotional foci, and performing or helping someone else perform the associated skills allows them closure.  This system would also allow the player to try out different phantoms and use skills they normally wouldn't.  If they don't like the particular phantom they have, they can work towards releasing it, or keep one around if they find one they gel with.

Potential cons: The player would have a hard time forming a bond with the phantom or investing in giving them a unique personality as other companion classes like druids and summoners might do.  The constant cycling of phantoms could also keep the player from deciding on a solid direction for the character as it grows, maybe wanting to remain a jack-of-all-trades to accommodate different potential phantoms.

I'm curious as to how other homebrewers and DMs would approach this. I eventually want to start a campaign around this idea, but I want to at least try to keep the spirit of the lore intact, such as how humans interact with various creatures that are of a race outside of humans.

I have tiles, props, PCs, NPCs, Monsters, and some other odd bits and bobbles I had to display visually for the players during our campaign. I will be updating the file as I add more art as our campaign evolves.

I used Piskel and have medium creatures at 16x16 (128x128P), large at 32x32 (256x256P), etc. Some creatures that are natively medium such as the Barbazu have been drawn bigger for theatric effect but can be resized to a single tile. You can easily import these files into Piskel and edit or build off of existing sprites to create something new, I do this for all of my humanoid creatures.

Would love any comments, questions, or suggestions and hope some of you find a use for these!

23rd level

3 different classes, and 1 prestige class on top of that

2,300,000 gp, but you must spend all of it.

No duplicate items

10 point-buy

I get squared away, set up, have conversations with the other potential GMs on how we want to handle things, and eventually get pointed to some potential players. Of the GMs, turns out only one other wanted to do Pathfinder and couldn't take in every player so I was given a list of players to contact. Of those players, two of them said yes while the third said probably not due to real life situations. (A fourth player contacted me to join, but ended up dropping later for reasons that I think eventually leads to bull crap but that's something else.)

So I introduce the players to Pathfinder and get a good idea of their schedule for the weekend. I also said that if they have and questions or want to run an idea by me to just shoot me a message. Only responses I get are when they are available. Now, the only time it was possible was Sunday, which is important. I post on Friday that we'll have a session 0 on Sunday a bit after noon, minding the time zones of the players. I also ask if it was alright with everyone. No response. Maybe I was foolish to assume that no reply meant they were good, but well, here I am.

Saturday rolls around, I create the game room on Roll20 and drop the invite link into the chatroom for just the players. I actually saw one of the players in the lobby at some point so I knew it was working. Sunday rolls around and about 20 minutes before the start time, I got ahead and start the server, listening for anyone to drop in as well as having Discord up for any messages. While waiting, I play around on the tutorial. 10 minutes to go, only player. 5 minutes to go, only player. At the start, still the only player. 5 minutes after, only player. I decide to wait for a whole 30 minutes, and no one shows up. No message, nothing. One player was online the entire time in Discord before going idle, another one showed up briefly on Discord then went online (also the one player who I had to make it Sunday for.) As I'm writing this, it has been almost an hour and a half and still no one has contacted me or tried to join.

And here is the thing, yes, I'm extremely salty. I stressed over this for a week which ended up being a bit of an issue as work is being stressful. I've been trying to think of strategies for dealing with two players, running some ideas by with some friends, and all to try and give two players the best experience I could give them. And this is just to go through session 0 of ""hey, what do you want to play and what do you not want to deal with?""

But here is my biggest problem with it and why having the session on Sunday just makes it worse: I had to give up racing for this session to be done this weekend. This very day, there is a race that I actually wanted to enter, but I decided to skip so that we could at least get this group going. The first race of the year, given up for players who can't even be bother to message me. You want to know when the next race is? June. Not next month, not the month after, June is the soonest I get to race.

So yeah, I'm not a happy GM at the moment. And honestly, I don't think I'll ever offer running a table for an online group again unless I know each of the players in person.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short version: Started a Pathfinder group for some people on an unrelated Discord channel. Two players agreed to join and proceed set a date and time for session 0, then never bother joining. And this GM could have been out doing something fun instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After today, I think I&amp;#39;m going to have to go to my other table and personally thank everyone there for being mature adults who are able to effectively communicate if they simply can&amp;#39;t play over a specific weekend.

This is that build.

The Escape Artist skill allows you to wriggle your way out of grabs or bindings. The Escapologist rogue archetype lets you use it to:

3rd level: Unfettered Mind (Su): slip out of a mind-affecting effect as a full-round action. Let's consider this. Now I'm taking my body's ability to contort and applying that to my mind, for no good Gozreh-damn reason. ""Oooh, let me just squeeze my way out of a vampire's domination, or find a mental loophole to literally jump through (but not really literally, but yes, literally) to get out of the Geas spell."" Hold Person? Until my next turn, sure. Fear effect? I'll sidestep that later. This is dumb, guys. I like it.

8th level: Impossible Escape (Su): Roll Escape Artist at -10, then use that *retroactively* as my AC, or as my Reflex save (as an immediate action, so less cheese for the rats here). It actually says that you contort yourself out of the way. This is less cool than Unfettered Mind, but more regularly applicable. ""Oh, that'll hit me for sure... guess I'll dislocate my knees so I can duck faster!"" 

Also of note: Replaces the normal Rogue Trapfinding in part; lose the bonus to Perception checks vs. traps, gain 1/2 level towards Escape Artist checks.

Queue my build:

**The Writhing Ratfolk**
FCB: 1/2 level to EA checks

Escapologist: 1/2 level to EA checks

Stealthy (feat): +2 to EA checks, +4 at later levels

Skill Focus (feat): +3 to EA checks, +6 at later levels

[Dislocate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dislocate/) (feat): Hurt yourself to lower time requirement on some EA checks. Eventually, you stop hurting yourself (good boi).

Signature Skill (feat): Just gives you a couple decent plusses to your EA skill like lowering time requirements and avoiding some effects before they happen.

Vagabond Child (Regional Trait): +1 to EA. Minor, but ~~who doesn't love a good~~ we like minor bonuses sometimes too. 

Start with a Dex of 17, get +2 from Ratfolk racial, pump that up with each level up because why not, so at level 20 you're looking at +7 there.



At this point, we're seeing a +13 to EA rolls at level 1, and a +61 to EA rolls at level 20. By level 3 we can already take 20 to get out of masterwork manacles (level one if you immediately go for Skill Focus). In 3.5, epic skill usage of EA allowed one to squeeze through a space smaller than one's own head at DC 80, and somehow friggin pass through a Wall Of Force at DC 120 (see [here](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm) for more of THAT kind of nonsense). Bear in mind, we haven't touched magic items yet. We should, but we won't in this OC. 

Other ideas of merit: 

Possessed Hand / Hand's Autonomy feats: The latter feat lets your hand act for you when you can't, sometimes. Here, it lets your hand roll any EA check for you at -4 if you couldn't already do it due to being unconscious, paralyzed, asleep, or stunned. This is now letting your demon hand force your body into contortions of both physical and mental (see Unfettered Mind) natures when you're otherwise preoccupied.

Sharptooth / Sharpclaw / Tunnel Rat / Burrowing Teeth feats: Leaning on the concept of Harry Houdini, you could go full disappearing act by learning how to tunnel on your own, too. Having a set of 3 natural weapons is already looking better than your Rogue-y BAB, just slap on a Weapon Finesse (via Finesse Rogue?) and now you've got a scrap-rat (heh). Getting out of jail is much easier when you don't need to Sleight Of Hand your weapons in! Just don't let them saw off your nat weps, mmkay? 

Skill Focus (Stealth) / Eldritch Heritage 1&amp;2 feats: Bit of a pricey feat dip here, but you have some good Stealth already so why not double dip when it comes to skills? The Shadow bloodline lets you get basically Hide In Shadow^TM with their 9th level ability, plus get 1-3/day shadowswappy Dimension Door shenanigans. Another step on the path to Houdinihood.

Any ideas on how to spice this up further? Scurrying Swarmer for combat capability? Umbral Gear for low-level cost-effective thievery?

A friend and I are collaborating for a couple of months, working together to make some interesting items with backstories. Sanguine Shard is the third of these. The card has cutting lines in case you want to print it.

**Additional item info**: The shard's emulsion produces an effect of euphoria based on the adrenaline in the user, and alters their taste perception, giving blood a unique and delicious taste, making everything else dull by comparison. While under its effects, and while in combat, their body comes under incredible strain (taking 1 hp/level/turn), only relieved with the shedding of others' blood, which instead heals them (same, 1hp/level/turn). The shard itself is quite fragile, and will break with a single point of damage. It must be dunked in blood and be left to drip for a week to produce enough emulsion for 1 use.

Her suggestions have been that Nualia's long lost parents of a hidden kingdom have come back to find her. At which, Nualia will magically repent and walk off to the sunset with them. Nevermind the party knows she set fire to the cathedral and killed her adoptive father.. -_____-lll

Should I just give her, her ending? Anyone have something better?

But what does it do? According to the black blooded oracle text: 

&gt; casts all necromantic spells at +1 caster level for the next 10 minutes, but takes 3d6 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage

Other than drinking it, just being in contact already affects you:

&gt; certain creatures like aberrations, undead, and black-blooded oracles possess an uncanny immunity to its effects. Any other creature that comes into contact with black blood takes 1d6 points of cold damage—10d6 points of cold damage per round if fully immersed. 

That said, the little there is about it are the bloodrager bloodline and oracle archetype, which are immune to both good and bad effects of the liquid, and get a couple of slightly bad abilities related to shooting it via injuries; and a little trait that makes you immune only to the bad effects of drinking it, which is great if you ask me. But, since I already made a very nice necromancer for another game happening in Geb (bones oracle + 2 lvls of antipaladin + agent of the grave), I'm trying to come up with something else than yet necromancer, then what does that leave us with for this occasion?

First things first, what could a character be doing there? How did it arrive? What's his goal? How did he get the black blood running through its body to begin with? So far what i got is:

* A bloodrager with the said bloodline, who also has the aberrant one (crossblooded) for extra weirdness, but i still don't know what he's doing there. 
   * An experiment from a random Drow at the Bloodforge? Perhaps it was someone from Leng or a Neothelid instead? But then, how'd he get out of there to the ""starting town"" which may or may not be in orv or even the darklands? And why would he go back down there?
* Another bloodrager with the said bloodline, but this one has Eldritch Heritage with the Ghoul bloodline. 
   * This could be related to Geb, Nemret Noktoria or even Leng itself. A character can be made a ghoul (or ghast) from many reasons, of which some could be exposure to lazurite, getting done in by a marrowstone golem or more commonly dying from ghoul fever so there are many opportunities to also obtain the Ghoul Template (which sort of makes the sorcerer ghoul bloodline redundant there). So... what's next? What does he do with that? Usurp the leadership of ghouls and become ghoul king of sorts and conquer sekamina or a vault afterwards?
* A black blooded oracle... this one is a bit of a mystery, no pun intended, and disappointment. 
   * Oracles aren't very tanky HP-wise so they shouldn't be getting the injuries they need to shoot the black blood; other than that, more than half the stuff you can find down there are aberrations and undead, who are immune to it so what's the point? Also, oracle again... guess not.
* A Hallowed Necromancer wizard with the black blood heritage trait. For this i'd need to share this bit of information also from black blooded oracle:

&gt; Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source, losing all mystical properties. [*Gentle repose*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gentle-repose) can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood’s magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. 

* This guy is a diametrically opposite to most, if not all, things related to the darklands. Who wouldn't want a substance that increases necromancy-based cure spells to kill undead? There's the Cube of Writhing Glyphs too and wizards are supposed to be scholars, right? But would he go as far as going deep into orv for that? Is it worth it? Bearing in mind that I also already made an enervation build for a PC totally unrelated to this, what other necromancy spell could I even use? Are bad touch builds still a thing? 

And there ends my little list of things *directly* related to the black blood. What else can i do in that vault that's not directly related to it? 

* Fungi: It's a very common and popular thing on all the levels of the darklands, in this vault there's the Black Mire and the Hanging Forest. Possible characters: Fungal Pilgrim Druid and Blightseeker Alchemist.
* Demons: This vault is the particular location of the demonic cults to Abraxas and Camazotz (I'm not sure if there's anyone remaining of the latter though). Possible characters: Anyone who hates demons badly enough to go Jules Verne full throttle to kill them?
* ~~Cthulhu~~ Elder Mythos: A sea of unknown depth made of a mysterious substance and that seeps from the walls? Aquatic monsters, giant worms and other sort of aberrations lurking in the dark? Cult to Orgesh and faceless statues made by some unknown being? It is pretty self-explanatory, right? Although a bit broad and stretchy imho. Possible characters: Elder Mythos Scholar... and that's pretty much it since most other things cross the line into a ~~Jojo's~~ bizarre realm of insanity and paranoia ~~right next to uncle Sheogorath's islands,~~ which is sorta hard (but strangely fun) to RP and not easy to manage in a way that won't make you machinate the death of your party members for the glory of our lord and savior ~~Cthulhu~~ Orgesh.

Fortunately, the item in question is already on d20pfsrd, but it is still so ridiculous

While the unicorn bloodline is also healing themed (CLW/CMW/CSW as spells known, arcana to heal allies a bit while casting any spell) at least it is not so broken as phoenix one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Bloodline Arcana**: When casting **any spell that deals fire damage**, you can instead heal your targets. The spell deals no damage, and living creatures affected by the spell **instead regain a number of** **hit points** **equal to half the fire damage** the spell would normally deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

That means that any fire spell can be a heal. While fun for blasters (half of uber optimized burning hands/scorching ray/fireball as healing), there is no clause that would protect the world from ""the healing cantrip"".

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes of thinking I see at least two ways to do it:

* Crossblooded into Elemental(fire) or Efreet to convert any damaging spell into fire
* Elemental spell metamagic + an appropriate trait

&amp;#x200B;

The spell used can be either disrupt undead (if you decide it is applicable as ""energy spell"") or a normal ray of frost/acid splash. The second option is better with blood havoc mutation (the 1lvl blood line power sucks so its no pain) + spell focus - to avoid healing 1/2 of 1 hit point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the whole thing will work as part of the blasting build - 1lvl of sorcerer / x lvls of admixture wizard etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So the result is either d6/2 (disrupt undead) or (d3+1)/2 (ray/splash + boost) of close range touch ray of healing. All at 1st level.

I started by looking at the ability to simply increase healing done, and the one ability that does this well is the [Lesser Celestial Totem](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/celestial-totem-lesser-su/). This requires being a character with Rage Powers, and the Skald is really, really good at providing this Rage Power to all your allies. But I wasn't sure what spells would be effective with the Skald, so I started looking at its Spell List. That's when I saw the 2nd Level Spell: [Boiling Blood](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/boiling-blood/).

Now, unless I'm reading something incorrectly, if you are a Phoenix Bloodline Sorcerer 1/Skald X and you cast Boiling Blood, you can grant 1 ally for every 3 Skald Levels you have the ability to heal for your Skald's Caster Level each round by spending a Standard Action to Concentrate on the spell, or simply cast it to let it run for a number of rounds equal to your Skald's Caster Level.

I feel like this is a really, really effective combination. I know it's not gamebreaking and will still be out-DPRed by enemies, but it gives an Arcane caster an actual strong healing function at the cost of 1 level.

But for this time, i really wanted to use a class based on my ever-obsession and love for dinosaurs.
Sadly, this is my first time ever building a Druid and i'm having more than just some random doubts, as Way of the Wicked gets merciless, i get to desire a more... optimized druid if i want to be more than just a magical dinosaur that screams at the ground to grow crops.

1. [what role?]

So, with the saurian shaman i get free sacred summoning (standard action instead of full round completion when summoning) on dinosaurs and reptiles.
As any druid, i get some good spells for either control, _downtime_ and somehow damage.
I have an animal companion (see you on point 2 and 3) and lastly, i get to be considered 2 levels higher for the wild shape, which at my level (7) is considered 9 if i turn into a dinosaur which gives me huge (both technically and effectively speaking) combat advantages, expecially with Grab and Rake on a pouncing juggernaut with a +6 strenght... scary!

So... what is my role? What should i fill my 5 feat slots with aside Wild Spells? Summoning 1 extra summon with 2 str and con by using 3 feats sounds a little underwhelming until i get to summon big bad creatures like ankylos or rexes (around Lv14? That's my level x2)... Should i focus more on my ability to buff and grab with feats like Dirty Fighter, Improved Grab and Greater Grab (even if, given the campaign theme i might be forced to fancy myself a player's familiar for sneaking)? Should i still pick those 3 feats to not be disturbed on higher levels? (Spell focus conjuration as a lv11 or 9th feat can sound _SO_ frustrating!)

2. [which pet to choose?]
Since i am forced by class to pick any kind of Dinosaur and the entire campaign is from 3rd party materials , (therefore out of official restrictions and bans) i was going to pick the infamous spinosaur, with his outstanding 15-19 CON and imposing 28  STR (at lv7!)
Is it wise to base my choice on the stats of the creature or should i pick something i like more such as a Giganotosaurus or a Tylosaurus? both have Grab, could try making it work as a tandem grab with my (potential) Grapple build (depending on question 1 ofc)

3. [what companion archetype?]
Looks like normal archetype is the best so far, but are there any archetypes doing better jobs with my companions? For example, the wrecker gets great anti-construct permanent buffs for a feat that i might get them later (or not, if the creature doesn't have many attacks!), a bodyguard might protect our blaster (considering they lose evasion makes me cringe knowing we have a BLASTER)  and healer (still, we have a blaster... and nothing really unallows me to just give it the feats once he reaches INT 3, a Bully might just have greater maneuvering options for potential tandem-grappling (i think i have to count as an orc for that or is there another feat helping?)
What's the general optimizing opinion on it?
Sorry, this is mostly tied to point 2 of ""what companion should i pick?""


4. [items]
This is a little bit more Mathfinder, but skipping the obvious mighty fists, mammoth helm, lesser Extend Rod, wis +X str +X or con +X We have the wild shape and armor issue: the armor either costs too much (+4 bonus is a crime!), i can't wear it (no heavy armor proficiency) or it becomes useless as i switch between Huge to Tiny (luckily enough, we have places where to store it if i don't wear it)
So, the question is Stone Plate Barding (low cost... somehow?) or waiting for Wild Stone Plate? (Unfairly expensive with the +3 from wild, that requires a blood tribute of +1 armor so, complexively +4 armor... but once i wear it, i use it even when going at the toilet! Hell, i'm getting a wand of Iron Bed just for it!)
Right now, a stone plate with my Huge form looks just the best i could ask for since the enemy hits hard (because of the strong composition, all enemies have the Advanced template), and money are valuable for a Druid that is still in need of hos bag of seeds!!!

5. [Traits]
Druids have the best tricks: wild shape for double the amount of time if i disguise myself into a familiar (compsognathus, tuatara or rhamphoryncus and so on...) to sneak into civilized places? Calling animals CR8 to train and use to fight the forces of oppressive good? (We're an evil campaign!) but what if Call Animal didn't just really work? Like, right now we have an entire wood without a single animal because it's a desecrated land... and our DM is... kinda well known to dislike cheesing via silly buggy tricks such as gifted adept (call animal)
Considering Question 1 (role) and question 4 (items), are these good traits? Taking the form of a tiny familiar kills both the whole allosaurus-line of feats and the stoneplate non-wild-armor barding... anything else besides Reactionary?

Please, forgive my wall of text full of interruptions, i really just want to not be disappointed by this class that, in many years just seemed like the ultimate dinosaur-based class (with the pets restrictions or class restrictions, many nice martial classes just really feel wasted as Dinosaur-flavouring... not as much as Druid, i mean!), thanks for the patience of reading... and please go easy on me &gt; ^ &lt;);","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get it, a tiger druid deals more damage and is a better antimage, a summoner isn&amp;#39;t limited only to dinosaurs and a shifter probably does better at becoming a war dinosaur.

So, the question is Stone Plate Barding (low cost... somehow?) or waiting for Wild Stone Plate? (Unfairly expensive with the +3 from wild, that requires a blood tribute of +1 armor so, complexively +4 armor... but once i wear it, i use it even when going at the toilet! Hell, i&amp;#39;m getting a wand of Iron Bed just for it!)
Right now, a stone plate with my Huge form looks just the best i could ask for since the enemy hits hard (because of the strong composition, all enemies have the Advanced template), and money are valuable for a Druid that is still in need of hos bag of seeds!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Traits]
Druids have the best tricks: wild shape for double the amount of time if i disguise myself into a familiar (compsognathus, tuatara or rhamphoryncus and so on...) to sneak into civilized places? Calling animals CR8 to train and use to fight the forces of oppressive good? (We&amp;#39;re an evil campaign!) but what if Call Animal didn&amp;#39;t just really work? Like, right now we have an entire wood without a single animal because it&amp;#39;s a desecrated land... and our DM is... kinda well known to dislike cheesing via silly buggy tricks such as gifted adept (call animal)
Considering Question 1 (role) and question 4 (items), are these good traits? Taking the form of a tiny familiar kills both the whole allosaurus-line of feats and the stoneplate non-wild-armor barding... anything else besides Reactionary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, forgive my wall of text full of interruptions, i really just want to not be disappointed by this class that, in many years just seemed like the ultimate dinosaur-based class (with the pets restrictions or class restrictions, many nice martial classes just really feel wasted as Dinosaur-flavouring... not as much as Druid, i mean!), thanks for the patience of reading... and please go easy on me &amp;gt; ^ &amp;lt;);&lt;/p&gt;

I will run a session trying out the new rules with a bunch of DnD veterans. We will use the premade chars found with the new edition playtest material, as I found them very useful in the way they present information and abilities.

One question I have though is, although they show your modifier for skills etc, these character sheets dont show whether you are trained, expert etc in those respective skills. Shouldnt we have that information on the sheets? Or is it not really worth looking over when testing the game? I felt its a neat system but it will be harder to explain if they cant see how it actually works.

My husband is a really good DM and is currently running a game in roll 20 using 5e that is going very well (we’ve been playing for a year now). My husband has expressed a desire to play as a PC in a long-term game and I want to learn to DM. 2+2 = I run a game for him right?! Right. Here’s the twist: my husband loves Pathfinder, wants to run one of the Paizo APs, but I only know 5e. He really talked up Pathfinder, so I was like “Sure! I’ll learn this system so we can do this thing. Sounds fun!” We settle on Rise of the Runelords, get all the necessary book (yay humble bundle), and I’m researching away. I even ran We Be Goblins for a group of friends to try to get a feel for the system. 

After my research and the one shot I have a lot of misgivings about Pathfinder as a system. I know my husband and thousands upon thousands of people love it though, so I have to wonder if there is something that I am missing. I’ve decided to share some of my concerns here in the hopes that you fine people can help me see how these things are addressed in game mechanics or how DMs handle them in a good way. 

Stat damage/Losing a level – These two things seem like a very feel bad mechanic to me. 

I understand that in some situations these penalties are temporary, but not all of them. My main concern is that these types of mechanics seem like they would lead to a ‘death spiral.’ You fail a save, take stat or level reduction, which makes it harder for you to pass saves to either remove the damage or prevent further damage of this type. Rinse, repeat a couple times and you have gimped/useless or dead PCs.   

Move Actions – I have not been able to wrap my head around some of these. Most of them make sense, but on the whole move actions seem very restrictive. My brain just rejects the idea that a character can’t draw a weapon while walking towards an enemy. My wizard can’t fire an orison, grab a piece of paper off a desk he’s next to, then move a few feet on his turn? Grabbing a piece of paper makes it so the PC can’t move? Is this game mechanic designed this way for balance of action economy? If that is the case it seems narritively terrible ☹ 

Overall Deadly – so I’m reading through RotRL and really liking the story. Then, I come to the part 4 of book 2: Misgivings. This place seems designed to straight up kill PCs. Haunts dealing wisdom, strength, charisma damage- or that can straight up kill a PC for failed saves, multiple chances to contract Vorel’s Phage or Ghoul Fever. I'm not sure how the players are supposed to actually survive all this.

During my We Be Goblins game, I am certain if I had stuck strictly to the move action rules that the game would have been a tpk during the Vorka fight, despite good tactics on the part of the players.

Is Pathfinder simply a deadlier system than I am used to? Are PC deaths a common/expected thing?

Please understand, I’m not trying to pooh-pooh Pathfinder as a system. These are real concerns I have about these mechanics leading to playing a game that is just not fun. As such I am looking for insight into the system and how these things are handled.

They started at 3rd level - all riding up to the same crossroads at the same time - and currently the party is 18th level, adventuring inside Rovagug's cage. This past Sunday, I experienced one of those moments where things are so absurd they become awesome.

Apologies for purists about PF canon.

Let me begin with the setting.

For the sake of my game, I decided that **Rovagug**'s greatest power is that he consumes divinity. Any god in his presence is rendered mortal. If he strikes a mortal, he temporarily severs them from the ability to use or receive divine magic. It was basically impossible for the gods to kill him, because every god he killed just made him stronger. Instead of slaying him, they sealed him away in the cage in the center of Golarion. There he sleeps, and his dreams of destruction manifest as a landscape of long-dead worlds constantly being torn apart.

Though Rovagug is trapped in slumber, every once in a while a god dies on the surface of Golarion, and Rovagug draws some of that god's essence into the cage with him. If he gets enough strength, he might awaken and break free of his cage, which is why the gods generally aren't reckless enough to meddle in mortal affairs.

Another thing I added is that Asmodeus locked a legion of loyal devils inside the cage to keep tabs on the Rough Beast. They are commanded by an archdevil who had once been a duke of hell - **Egal the Shimmering**, whose purview is greed, mercenaries, and creators of magnificent treasure.

The party had a long road getting here, and the whole tale is more complicated than is necessary to explain for this story. Suffice it to say, they're trying to rescue some innocents and stop some villains, and this next session, the world might end. 

But first, they kitted up with tons of magic items to deal with whatever they might find, and entered the cage. During a few days of exploring, they encounter remnants of long-dead gods, whose essence was pulled into the cage. They have a harrowing experience talking down **Dou-Bral** as he's trapped in a cycle slowly going mad and turning into **Zon-Kuthon** every few days. They find a shattered metal angel with a halo like an angry red eye (our play group previously played through the **Iron Gods** adventure path). They find a hollow mummy of **Ptah**, one of the Osirioni gods who never made it over from the Egyptian pantheon.

In Ptah's tomb, they found a lich named **Sorvab** who pitifully asked to die. Our Shelynite paladin, **Thaddeus**, took mercy on the thing and learned that Sorvab had once been a mortal man on a truly ancient world that Rovagug destroyed before he ever came to Golarion. Sorvab had created a minor artifact that was both a *mirror of life trapping* and a *mirror of opposition*. Made of polished gold, it would consume the soul of anyone who touched it and replace their soul with one of a diametrically opposed alignment. It could only hold one soul at a time.

He had offered it as a gift to Egal the Shimmering, hoping to get Hell's assistance in saving his world. Instead, Egal tested the mirror on Sorvab, creating a loyal minion, whom he commanded to become a lich so he could serve forever. When Rovagug threatened Golarion and Asmodeus set Egal to the task of controlling the inside of the cage, Sorvab came too. He lacked the mindless discipline of the devils, so he started to go mad and deserted, fleeing into a distant spot in the nightmarish landscape within the cage. Now he simply wanted to die, to have his phylactery destroyed, because he was convinced he would never escape.

Thaddeus offered instead to recover the mirror and restore Sorvab's soul, and perhaps make him alive again. 

To reach the people they wanted to rescue, the paladins would have to make it past the Golden Legion anyway, and so Tad hoped he would find the mirror in their fortress. When they approached the fortress, they were met by a messenger carrying a big cauldron of gold coins. He poured them out, and they levitated, forming Egal the Shimmering's face. To the party's surprise, Egal said he didn't care if they went any further, as long as they didn't interfere with Asmodeus's plans: namely, don't free Rovagug.

Since apparently a fight wasn't going to happen, Tad asked if maybe they could buy something from him. A bit of bartering later, and the party trades a few hundred thousand GP worth of stuff for the mirror. With surprisingly little fanfare, they let Sorvab touch the mirror, which obliterates his lich body and replaces it with his mortal body and his original, not-evil soul. 

Riding high on their victory (and high on their horses), the paladins travel past the fortress of the golden legion to their ultimate destination, a palace that holds a prisoner they intend to rescue. Here's where I make a silly error.

They find a sword on the ground with a green crystal blade, and beside it a cracked statue of an imposing man with Azlanti features. They realize this is a fragment of Aroden. Whatever may have killed him, a piece of him ended up here.

I'm just thinking, hey, this will be a fun bit of mystery, because they'll know Aroden is dead, but still won't know why. It's a big part of the setting, and even now, the answer is hidden from them.

The paladin of Ra, **Akhenra**, pipes up that he has a *scroll of true resurrection*, which works as long as the person died in the past 170 years. Aroden died 111 years ago.

Someone points out that he's not just dead; he's petrified.

Don't worry, says Akhenra. My *lay hands* can cure petrification through a mercy.

I decide at that point that one of the things Asmodeus definitely doesn't want is Aroden coming back, even as a mortal, to make trouble. So the Golden Legion starts lopping trebuchet buckets of lava at the party, which arc for a few miles and start landing around them. They are not deterred, however, and restore Aroden from petrification, then abscond with his body to a safe distance, at which point they revive him. He has lost his divine powers, but he's still, like, canonically a very high level spellcaster, and I figure he's wished himself to have super high stats.

Of course they ask him how he died. So I kinda broke a cardinal rule of the PF setting by answering that. Oops?

He's disturbingly *not* selfless, but he's certainly got a grudge against Hell. So they make a plan to storm the Golden Legion's fortress.

The crux of that plan is this. Aroden disguises everyone with *invisibility* and *mind blank* from a distance, they fly into Egal's throne room with flight magic on their steeds and such, and then they kick ass. A group of 20th level paladins do a *number* on a throne room filled with high-level devils -- Akhenra solos a pit fiend over the span of two turns, Thaddeus and his horse both with Combat Reflexes tear apart a phalanx of bearded devils, our archer **Marthel** kills some invisible horned devils, and so on. 

And then there's Egal the Shimmering, with basically the statblock of CR 25 Amon, Duke of Hell (3rd party - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc), plus I added some special powers like conjuring a treasure hoard avalanche, and greedily copying any spells other casters use around him. The fiend is exceptionally powerful. But even exceptionally powerful dukes of hell can fail saving throws.

So when the rest of the party is distracting him, Egal doesn't notice Aroden run up beside him, take the golden mirror like a two handed bludgeon, and bonk the archdevil in the face. One shitty saving throw later, and the party has a freshly minted Chaotic Good empyreal lord on their side.

&lt;p&gt;The paladin of Ra, &lt;strong&gt;Akhenra&lt;/strong&gt;, pipes up that he has a &lt;em&gt;scroll of true resurrection&lt;/em&gt;, which works as long as the person died in the past 170 years. Aroden died 111 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone points out that he&amp;#39;s not just dead; he&amp;#39;s petrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry, says Akhenra. My &lt;em&gt;lay hands&lt;/em&gt; can cure petrification through a mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide at that point that one of the things Asmodeus definitely doesn&amp;#39;t want is Aroden coming back, even as a mortal, to make trouble. So the Golden Legion starts lopping trebuchet buckets of lava at the party, which arc for a few miles and start landing around them. They are not deterred, however, and restore Aroden from petrification, then abscond with his body to a safe distance, at which point they revive him. He has lost his divine powers, but he&amp;#39;s still, like, canonically a very high level spellcaster, and I figure he&amp;#39;s wished himself to have super high stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they ask him how he died. So I kinda broke a cardinal rule of the PF setting by answering that. Oops?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s disturbingly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; selfless, but he&amp;#39;s certainly got a grudge against Hell. So they make a plan to storm the Golden Legion&amp;#39;s fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of that plan is this. Aroden disguises everyone with &lt;em&gt;invisibility&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mind blank&lt;/em&gt; from a distance, they fly into Egal&amp;#39;s throne room with flight magic on their steeds and such, and then they kick ass. A group of 20th level paladins do a &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; on a throne room filled with high-level devils -- Akhenra solos a pit fiend over the span of two turns, Thaddeus and his horse both with Combat Reflexes tear apart a phalanx of bearded devils, our archer &lt;strong&gt;Marthel&lt;/strong&gt; kills some invisible horned devils, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s Egal the Shimmering, with basically the statblock of CR 25 Amon, Duke of Hell (3rd party - &lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc""&gt;https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc&lt;/a&gt;), plus I added some special powers like conjuring a treasure hoard avalanche, and greedily copying any spells other casters use around him. The fiend is exceptionally powerful. But even exceptionally powerful dukes of hell can fail saving throws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the rest of the party is distracting him, Egal doesn&amp;#39;t notice Aroden run up beside him, take the golden mirror like a two handed bludgeon, and bonk the archdevil in the face. One shitty saving throw later, and the party has a freshly minted Chaotic Good empyreal lord on their side.&lt;/p&gt;

The boss had some custom mechanics (similar to legendary/lair actions in 5E or boss mechanics in video games) and while I try to telegraph stuff, I don't think that's going to work 100% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we need to decide on some general principles going forward.  Without risk of death/loss, I feel the game has less meaning.  On the flip side, if there's, say, four boss fights per level and you succeed 95% of the time, that's likely several more TPKs by the end of the campaign (this is assuming you never die to lesser encounters which technically could also happen).  There's at least three main options: 

&amp;#x200B;

1, ""IT WAS ALL A DREAM!"" I don't really like this option, I think it cheapens death and makes failing meaningless.

&amp;#x200B;

2, reset but with consequences.  people have mentioned the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor.  In this case it would probably be something like the encounter you just wiped to getting a small boost across the board while you get a second chance.  If you die again, it gets boosted more.  if this happens a few times it's going to become impossible and it becomes a TPK.  So you get a few chances but that's it -- and it's a bit harder each time.

&amp;#x200B;

3, TPKs are TPKs.  If the party is wiped out, that's that.  New party (or if one person escaped then most of a new party or whatever).

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the concern here is also disruption of plotlines.  If one person dies (falls into lava and there's nothing left to rez, let alone raise dead) then that can already disrupt stuff and that's ""good"" because death should be meaningful...but it's a far cry short of jettisoning every NPC connection/character arc and resetting with a new party.

I know its a mythic spell (its under the section ""Mythic Magic -&gt; Mythic Spells"", but the rules I'm reading seem to be talking about learning how to amplify non-mythic spells into mythic variants.

Beware: early spoilers for Ruins of Azlant. 

TL/DR: My players insist on being diplomats instead of dungeon divers and have begun bribing a grindylow to help them bribe other grindylow with alcohol. And bluff their leader into thinking the grindylow have an army.

The set-up is that my players are about halfways through the first book still. They have finished checking out the town, found the choker caves while investigating Levin Farm and cleared that out right then and there, took their boat back to meet up with the rest of the colonists instead of hiking there, which caused them to skip the incutilis and finding the jack warden trail. They defused the boat situation expertly, and instead of immediately dealing with the grindylows they sailed back to the colony and rested up before heading back to the cave, which is where we started the session.

Because we are short a PC I started them at level 2, and they were still level 2 going into the grindylow cave. In the entrance to the cave they take out 2 grindylows in under 1 round, stabilize them both, and the Paladin decides she wants to parley with the clan instead of committing genocide. Luckily the Gillman Archaeologist speaks aquan and can communicate, so he gets things rolling. They come to an agreement with one of the grindy's (which we named Groose after the zelda character) that he would go with them if they gave him grog and supported his claim for chieftain if/when Brinetooth dies. They spend the next 2 hours of real time talking to Groose and Ramona arranging the best way to ally themselves with the grindylow tribe and trying to put together a suitable gift for the grindylow chieftain. And due to a very good bluff roll (on the Paladin's part of all characters!) Ramona now thinks that hundreds of grindylow surround the island/colony.

&gt;*Shock (Su) Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock

two or more shocker lizards are within

together to create a lethal shock once

So by my understanding, when the lizards do a group shock the players will have to roll a DC of 22 or take 12d8 damage. 

Here's my question. How does this attack happen? Say I roll that the lizards can shock every 2 rounds. On the first Lizard's first turn does he activate this attack and then all the Lizards turns are skipped because he used this attack? Or would it be more like all the lizards aid the last lizard and he activates it? 
Or do all the lizards get separate attacks? Or do I for that one round have them attack as though they were a swarm? I am unsure how this works.

Aura of Hopelessness (Su) All creatures except divs within 30 feet of an akvan must make a successful DC 30 Will save or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Create Ghul (Su) Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Shake Faith (Su) Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Torturous Gullet (Su) As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan’s stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.

####Ecology  

Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well.

Akvans seek out wonders to destroy—monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan’s evil does not end with its victim’s death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield—or are belched up from an akvan’s gullet—as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves.

Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile.

Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds.
Akvan Princes
As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes.

Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4–8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22­–24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts.

Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish.

Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains resist fire 30, an efreeti’s heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like abilities: at will—quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day—wish.

Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will—invisibility; 3/day—gaseous form, wish.

Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid’s water’s fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like abilities: constant—water breathing, water walk; at will—quickened control water; 3/day—horrid wilting, wish.

Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity 20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will—ethereal jaunt, invisibility; 3/day—insanity, mage’s disjunction, wish.

And there's nothing wrong with that, the point of this post isn't to tell you not to do that because you should.

&amp;#x200B;

But what you should do is take a look at what the token art the other PCs are using is and use that to temper your expectations or even determine if that game is right for you before you even post an Player App in the LFG.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you found this art of a grizzled barbarian warrior drawn in a hyper realistic style and it's cool and you love it....but maybe it's not the right thing for the game of Magical Girl Princess Power. The inverse also being true, I've had dozens and dozens of people post 12 year old anime girls to the LFG pages of my dark gothic horror games. And maybe those apps are REALLY GREAT CHARACTERS that I want in my game very much and maybe the players are the best around, but seeing this Loli nestled in with dour steampunk oil stained hardarses just....well it draws me out and makes me warry of that character. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it doesn't even have to be a tonal thing. You maybe love drawing your own tokens but your art skills are.....not quite there yet. It can unintentionally give a bad impression when you post this stick figure in with the group of guys who spent a couple hundred dollars each to have their tokens custom made by professional artists. 

&amp;#x200B;

and then there's sexual content, Maybe you think that loin clothed, pasties on her boobs, elf wench is really awesome, but maybe the group just isn't really going for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make isn't "" Your wrong to post that "" my point isn't "" Lol Anime sucks get it out of here "" rather the point I want to make is that pictures speak a thousand words and when I see your token, more so than alot of your backstory is going to color my impression of your character and you as a player and when I'm sifting through a dozen applications that can make a very big difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this goes both ways also! Maybe you want that anime ninja character or that guy who's got a flaming sword and armor and glowing eyes and lightning bolt cape at level 1. Looking at the token art other people post can give you a good impression if it's worth posting in that LFG, See a bunch of other Anime portraits? Your gonna feel right at home! Nobody likes being the odd man out afteral.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course there are also GM's and groups who just dont' care so dont' take any of this as law or the gospel truth, just something to consider if you find your having trouble getting into games and need every little edge you can get.

I can't picture my devil trigger state having a ton of arms, and I'm not even sure how effective that is in the first place, so insight is appreciated.

I will definitely bring it up next time at the full table that it bothers me, including me deciding for my character that he was ordered home for orc-reasons (dwarf) if this rule will stay.

There is a lot of argument on how the blade adept works.

So here goes (Please note that this is not in terms of PFS but home games):

1) The blade adept's black blade cannot be enhanced, like the magus's black blade, correct? This is despite this being a bonded object? This is to avoid an enhancement issues for game mechanics, correct?

2) Does the black blade maintain any enhancement prior to becoming a black blade?

3) The arcanist's arcane reservoir replaces the magus's arcane pool. How is the arcane reservoir points calculated? 3 + arcanist level or 1/3 arcanist level + intelligence (because of the black blade feature)?

4) The magus feature is described as the arcane pool. If the arcanist's reservoir replaces the arcane pool, can the arcanist use the reservoir to enhance the black blade like how the magus can enhance the black blade?  The black blade has it's own arcane pool.  Can you use it to enhance the black blade?

5) Why pick blade adept over vmc magus? They appear to have roughly the same amount of tradeoffs and benefits. For every increase to the black blade, vmc magus can also enhance the weapon, but do it better and with any weapon. The lost feats were likely to be spent on metamagic or item creation, which can be acquired through the arcanist exploits you saved.

Basically, from what I've seen:

Blade adept:   
\- 3 exploits   
\- Eldritch Blade   
\- Spell Strike

VMC Magus:   
\- 3 exploits (metamagic)   
\- Broad Study   
\- Trade in for Spell Strike   
\- No sentient weapon bonuses - Trade for familiar?

Both of these allow me to get Arcane Accuracy which was the biggest appeal to me.

Accurate strike from VMC is also pretty appealing.  

I can see giving up spellstrike to reduce the cost of the archetype.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Pathfinder 2.0 coming up as the the main focus, I thought I&amp;#39;d take a shot at getting some questions answered over the blade adept, especially after playing it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of argument on how the blade adept works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here goes (Please note that this is not in terms of PFS but home games):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The blade adept&amp;#39;s black blade cannot be enhanced, like the magus&amp;#39;s black blade, correct? This is despite this being a bonded object? This is to avoid an enhancement issues for game mechanics, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Does the black blade maintain any enhancement prior to becoming a black blade?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The arcanist&amp;#39;s arcane reservoir replaces the magus&amp;#39;s arcane pool. How is the arcane reservoir points calculated? 3 + arcanist level or 1/3 arcanist level + intelligence (because of the black blade feature)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) The magus feature is described as the arcane pool. If the arcanist&amp;#39;s reservoir replaces the arcane pool, can the arcanist use the reservoir to enhance the black blade like how the magus can enhance the black blade?  The black blade has it&amp;#39;s own arcane pool.  Can you use it to enhance the black blade?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Why pick blade adept over vmc magus? They appear to have roughly the same amount of tradeoffs and benefits. For every increase to the black blade, vmc magus can also enhance the weapon, but do it better and with any weapon. The lost feats were likely to be spent on metamagic or item creation, which can be acquired through the arcanist exploits you saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, from what I&amp;#39;ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blade adept:&lt;br/&gt;
- 3 exploits&lt;br/&gt;
- Eldritch Blade&lt;br/&gt;
- Spell Strike&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMC Magus:&lt;br/&gt;
- 3 exploits (metamagic)&lt;br/&gt;
- Broad Study&lt;br/&gt;
- Trade in for Spell Strike&lt;br/&gt;
- No sentient weapon bonuses - Trade for familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these allow me to get Arcane Accuracy which was the biggest appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate strike from VMC is also pretty appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;

I have been tasked to GM a one night adventure. We should have 4 people playing, all newer players to both role-playing IRL and Pathfinder. I am looking for a good one night module that is isn't too hard for newer players to handle, but that will still be fun! My thoughts are 3rd level, gives players a bit more to play with compared to 1st level, but still simple enough. Ill most likely have them use pre-generated characters.

Have any good ones in mind?

If it helps I have been a GM before for a 2 night adventure, but that was a few years ago. I am a green GM overall.

While I'm not playing, I devise plans to save my party's butt from different situations, and today's disaster is ""everyone is down, i'm the only person up"".

 My first instinct as an Arcanist is to nope the hell out of there with my companions, so Dimensional Slide, Swift Action Bloodline Development Vestige Bloodline to use a bound item to cast Teleportation to get me and my friends to a safe place.

While this is the main plan, I doubt everyone in going to be in range of my teleportation spell (the paladin and the warrior might be 20 fts apart from each other), and so I asked myself, if I use a Reach Metamagic Rod (or the feat), does it increase the range of people I can teleport from Touch to Close? Or is the Teleportation range that gets increased? By RAW I would say the first since the ""range"" is ""personal and touch"", but later the spells specify that there is need of contact between the targets.

Edit: I'll add that the Reach Spell feats specify that you can't apply it to spells that lack the range of Touch, Close or Medium, and since the Teleport ""travel range"" is none of these, I suspect that you can't increase it with said feat, leaving the ""personal and touch"" the only increasable part, but the need of contact still confuses me.

So to start I threw them all into jail together as an obligatory sticking them together to avoid the tavern of awkward. There were a few things to do in the jail as I burned down the village they were in around them to establish some immediate tension. 

 Immediately two of them start putting out fires and the wizard decides to go look for a shop cause he loves fucking with rich assholes. But everything is on fire so yeah stuff happens and some raiders are robbing a store and he stops them. Then steals the stuff they're stealing. 

So we go back to the two putting fires out and they go on and save a bunch of people from burning buildings rather than fight the pillagers with the guards. They're not a very combat orientated group. 

Eventually things calm down and all the saved people vouch for the party so the guards pardon them and let them go. At this point the party introduces themselves to each other and go get drink in a tavern for shenanigans. 

The wizard checks his items he stole and discovers a bag of gold, a bag of uncut gems, and a bag of magic dust for an unknown use. But he also notices that there is also ordinary sand in the bag. So he goes off to the shop he stole it from and blackmails the shopkeep into buying his silence for conning people. 

We take a short break around this time because I expected the prison break to take longer and have to plan some on the fly shit now. 

We come back from the break and one of them suggests talking to the captain of the guard about the raid. They discover through some rp that this is a common occurrence and the raiders are in fact slavers who kidnapped the blacksmith's daughter. 

After talking to the blacksmith and another guard they get the girl's description and a possible location for the slavers. 

Next they decide to gather supplies for the trip so they go and visit that shopkeeper that the wizard stole from earlier. After a bit of rp and haggling they get some legitimate supplies and head off to the cave. 

They get to the cave and there are two slavers keeping watch. They develope a plan and it almost works. But then everything went wrong. The rogue missed the sneak attack, the illusionists spell failed, and the excleric couldn't get in fast enough with their heavy armor.

Now the baddies inside are definitely aware of the attackers and I've got some plans for the inside of the cave which I will run them through next week.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that she has been Aldern's obsession. He started out being a bit too clingy to her and inappropriately giving her all the credit for saving him. They chose not to go on the boar hunt as they had a feeling he was creepy and it was a trap. After that though he left a gift of a masterwork composite longbow for her when he left and has not returned. I have played up small items of hers having gone missing as well... but no one really seemed to notice for too long as other events just kept occuring. During the downtime between adventures she even talked about maybe looking him up... she had definitely come to think of him more fondly when nothing bad had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

With her leaving I am really disappointed both that all of that foreshadowing and setup went in to setting her up as the perfect target of his obsession as well as now having lost the opportunity to make it be whomever I am going to have to target next... just bummed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... other suggestions? I hate killing off a character after their player leaves the game, but it seems that Aldern letting his obsession get to him might be the perfect thing. She just goes missing and no one knows where she is. When they get to the mansion they see painting that look almost just like her (she described her character very similar to what Iesha looks like in the art)... then they find her body when they get down stairs to finally confront Aldern along with the table holding all of the little curious of hers he had acquired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another possibility that occurred to me was actually replacing Iesha with her. She had a whirlwind romance after the last adventure, got married and things played out very similarly. Not sure I like this though as it messes with the timeline and opens a lot of questions... like why the PCs weren't invited to any wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I need to pick a new obsession. I have never liked the non-lust options as much and especially with no time to prep any foreshadowing... I am more at a loss of how to proceed. I suppose it could be fun to try and frame one of the characters for the murders as time goes on... maybe the low RP halfling cavalier. Not sure if that would really help pull the player in more or be something he just doesn't care about.

I've been extensively researching my spell choices online and as the game has progressed I find myself drifting away more and more from some universally praised choices like Fireball, Stinking Cloud, and Stone Call. Black tentacles is in reach now but I just don't see myself taking it, despite how great it sounds. It just feels like a waste of a slot when I'm unlikely to have a good opportunity to cast it without hitting my allies.

My party (monk, ranger, rogue, bard) has pretty high initiative, and while mine is up among the highest, more often than not at least one ally is in the way of AoE when my turn comes. Worse still, the Spire in general seems like a pretty cramped place. Usually when combat starts, we're already too close to the enemy for a fireball or a cloud, even if I asked whoever is ahead of me to delay.

That's not to say I never use AoEs. Early on I got a few good color sprays off. And there was one boss encounter I managed to launch a fireball from a scroll to good effect. But nine times out of ten, it just ain't happening. Because of this, I find myself taking more targeted spells like Burning Arc, Slow, and Icy Spears and not picking up Fireball, Stinking Cloud, or Black Tentacles. I've had Web for a few sessions but still haven't had a good chance to use it.

Now, I'm not complaining per say. I don't have any regrets (other than not realizing how many more spells I would know if my PC were human). I'm pretty happy with my spell choices and our party has been doing well. **I'm just curious why my experience seems so different than most I've read.**

Is the Emerald Spire just too cramped? Am I missing some tactical options? (I know of the selective spell feat, but I'm still not high enough level to meet the prerequisite.)

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is that I'm not sure about how to approach the game with them. I have written two brief intro adventures that will give me the option of doing either:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Giving the players a choice of pre-gen characters, including background story, character traits, objectives etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Giving them blank slate characters that are basically 'fresh souls' in story terms and have no experiential memories (although their bodies retain some 'muscle memory' that explains their skills/knowledges/abilities etc - there is then future RP potential for discovering who their body was via physical characteristics (tattoos, being recognised, etc) that becomes part of the story). This lets me, as GM, guide them in situations in a more seamless, narrative way (ie, something tells you that you could probably balance across this narrow ledge etc).  


&amp;#x200B;

The question is: what are people's experiences with total new players, how do they respond to RP elements, what are some challenges people have found in this space and how do you overcome them?

&lt;p&gt;My dilemma is that I&amp;#39;m not sure about how to approach the game with them. I have written two brief intro adventures that will give me the option of doing either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Giving the players a choice of pre-gen characters, including background story, character traits, objectives etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Giving them blank slate characters that are basically &amp;#39;fresh souls&amp;#39; in story terms and have no experiential memories (although their bodies retain some &amp;#39;muscle memory&amp;#39; that explains their skills/knowledges/abilities etc - there is then future RP potential for discovering who their body was via physical characteristics (tattoos, being recognised, etc) that becomes part of the story). This lets me, as GM, guide them in situations in a more seamless, narrative way (ie, something tells you that you could probably balance across this narrow ledge etc).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: what are people&amp;#39;s experiences with total new players, how do they respond to RP elements, what are some challenges people have found in this space and how do you overcome them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

The basic concept is that you take a half-orc or orc archer(doesn't seem to matter a huge deal what the base class is) and through use of other character buffs or item buffs you make something truly disgusting.   


First step is to give our monstrosity a Orc Hornbow(2d6). Step 2 is to cast enlarge person on him, he becomes large sized, and so with his new size his bow would go up to a Large sized Orc Hornbow(3d6). Through further magic, we apply the Gravity bow spell and now the Large Orc Hornbow counts as one size larger for damage(4d6). I am pretty certain at this point we are still RAW, however we can go further and I am wondering if this crosses the line.  


If our Orc siege weapon here were to get an enchantment of Growing Weapon on his bow, then we are looking at a Large Orc Hornbow, that for 10 minutes a day he can make a Huge Orc Hornbow(6d6) and use without penalty. If we want to get even more wonky the Orc Archer could use a Large Hornbow from the get go, sure he takes a -2 but think of the pay off when we apply all our buffs and the final result is a Large Orc wielding a Huge Growing Orc Hornbow with gravity bow on top of it for 8d6 per arrow.

####Appearance  

A contemplative humanoid face framed by a cobra-like hood adorns the body of this long, brightly colored serpent.

####CR   10
#####Alignment:  LG
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Poison (Ex) Bite—injury or spit—contact; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spells A guardian naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a guardian naga.

Spit (Ex) A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobra-like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds.

While many guardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder—towering waterfalls, natural spires, mountaintop temples—minding them out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder’s charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.

I'm drawing inspiration from the movie [Eagle Eye](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059786/): the system organizes a massive coup d'etat that would kill a lot of the heads of state, until the calculated ""best candidate for the government"" is the next in line of succession. In the campaign, the system would be pushing tensions within Andoran (provoking fighting to build the people into an anti-government fervor), before sparking an event that will murder the Supreme Elect and his sympathizers.

Trouble is, I'm trying to find the ways to mechanically represent this system. I'm thinking of an AI system from the Technology Guide, but Andoran isn't a high-tech setting, and I'm hoping to build something that's more based on magic than computers. Perhaps the system has control of an army of constructs. 

I was also hoping to give the system an ability to monitor the state of the nation remotely. I know in other nations, powerful spellcasters use birds as scouts (I'm thinking of Irrisen, where the witches of the government use ravens as their eyes and ears in the countryside).

Vivisectionist - alchemist with sneak attack is just a better rogue

Gunslinger - counters tanks, disarms martials easily, out damages many classes easily and fights with lore. Bolt ace is arguable.

Summoner - makes turns take a very long time if you aren't well managed. My group is not well managed.

&amp;#x200B;

The feat theoretically has a niche fulfilling a specific fantasy, that of the powerful warrior who finishes off foes [in a single blow](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F20KSmo8aJ7HYu5L0rf%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;f=1). You don't need a second hit--one is enough. It's pretty badass if you can pull it off.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend Bob sees the feat and he thinks ""wow, I'd love to make a character centered around that!"" Bob proceeds to use the feat chain as a build-around. He goes out of his way to find the largest possible weapons, invests in the whole feat chain, picks up other feats to support the strategy, and then spends every possible round of combat vital-striking.

&amp;#x200B;

This build is bad bad bad. A vital strike is not as good as a full-attack action in most cases. Bob gets screwed over by effects like *blur* or *mirror* image. There will be turns when Bob naturally rolls low on the d20, effectively loses all his attacks for the turn, and feels bad. And even if Bob hits, the payoff isn't really there; it probably doesn't deal more damage per round than a full attack even in the best case scenario. The feat simply isn't good enough to support an entire character concept.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's secretly a great utility feat. Rather than making it a build-around, you can slap it onto martial characters for circumstantial value.

&amp;#x200B;

The first use for the feat is mobility. Combat in Pathfinder typically rewards martial characters for planting their feet and full-attacking. And one of the advantages that casters have over warriors is the ability to cast their spell for the round and then move, getting the most out of their action economy without compromising their effectiveness. Vital strike stretches out your action economy, allowing you to move without missing out on the entire value of a full attack. If moving and then attacking is two actions, think of moving and then using a vital strike as 2.5 actions.

&amp;#x200B;

How to benefit from the mobility? Finish off an injured enemy and then start moving on to the next one. Use it instead of a charge action, to deal more damage when the enemy has low AC, or when the terrain doesn't allow charging. Walk around the enemy's cover and then shoot them with a vital strike musket ball. Or hit a powerful enemy and then walk away to bait out its AoO for the turn.

&amp;#x200B;

The second use is damage reduction. Ideally you'd get around DR by using the correct weapons. But sometimes you won't have a silver holy bullet when you entered the dungeon prepared to fight fairies, and found devils instead. That's ok--vital strike is naturally good against DR.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, vital strike can be great for the surprise round. The goal of a good ambush is to end the battle before it begins, but this is often difficult in Pathfinder. Sometimes there are low-HP, high-value targets who need to die in a single round. Sentries will survive the first hit and raise an alarm, or wizards will survive and teleport away. Vital strike isn't a silver bullet to this problem, but it helps. You can't take a full attack action in the surprise round anyway, so vital strike can be another way to turn your one standard action into 1.5 standard actions. Some characters like rangers or slayers may be able to creep all the way up into melee before combat begins. Archers and gunslingers may get off a vital strike shot from concealment before combat begins. If you have a stealthy martial character, consider taking this feat.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

&amp;#x200B;

**The best thing about vital strike** is that it can be made to do a lot of work for a small investment. Picking up a single feat (or maybe two, if you're a fighter with feats to spare) is enough to generate value in a wide variety of circumstances. Just be sure you use it judiciously, and not as your main mode of attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**The worst thing about vital strike** is that it doesn't do a very good job of supporting the fantasy that it represents. Bob will probably never chop a pit fiend in half with one blow, and he'll sacrifice a lot of power in the futile quest to do so. He may land OHKOs on weak enemies, but it won't support an entire character concept the way that he wants it to, unless he plays at a really-power table.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat/""&gt;Vital strike&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#39;t exactly bad so much as it is a victim of its own coolness.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

At Rimeskull were our heroes

A mystery to crack!

When they woke up fearsome Arkryst

Who thought “I could use a snack”

And the dragon breathed his wrath on them

A mighty, icy sneeze!

Never thinking that that was the day

That’d he be killed with bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

The heroes reeled and scattered

Any lesser folk would crumble

As the dragon eyed their haunches

With his belly all a’rumble

And as he drifted out of reach

Of bear and orc with ease

He thought “There’s no way this is the day

That I’ll be killed with bees”

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

They might have died right then and there

But Prinella got to healin’

And Hamphrey conjured figments

Of some folk doin’ some stealin’

And Kieran conjured up a wall

Of unseen energies

Still the dragon, hale and hearty,

Feared no blades or spells or bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

The bear and orc got in some licks

The beast was not impressed

And he looked upon his quarries

To see which would taste the best

He snatched up Kieran in his jaws

Thinking “Tastes a bit like cheese,”

And breathed a final icy blast

Before he died from bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

Then Pow’ll and Hamphrey linked their hands

And with great courageous flare

Did teleport athwart its back

As it sped on through the air

“I will not die from stabbings by

Such nasty mites as these!”

He cried, when Pow’ll struck – correct!

For he would die from bees.

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

Kieran took the final key,

By Prinella’s grace, alive

And Arkryst tried to crush his foes

In a final fatal dive

But they dove clear, and ere his foes

He with his breath could freeze

The halfling nocked his swarmbow:

They killed the beast with bees.

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

They unlocked a new adventure

With seven magic keys,

And faced in ancient Runeforge

Many stranger things than these

But of all their tales, as scary

And as thrilling as you please,

We’ll always get a laugh about

The dragon and the bees

&lt;p&gt;And as he drifted out of reach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of bear and orc with ease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought “There’s no way this is the day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I’ll be killed with bees”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might have died right then and there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Prinella got to healin’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Hamphrey conjured figments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of some folk doin’ some stealin’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Kieran conjured up a wall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of unseen energies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the dragon, hale and hearty,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feared no blades or spells or bees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bear and orc got in some licks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beast was not impressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he looked upon his quarries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see which would taste the best&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He snatched up Kieran in his jaws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking “Tastes a bit like cheese,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And breathed a final icy blast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before he died from bees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Pow’ll and Hamphrey linked their hands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with great courageous flare&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did teleport athwart its back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it sped on through the air&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will not die from stabbings by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such nasty mites as these!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cried, when Pow’ll struck – correct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For he would die from bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kieran took the final key,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Prinella’s grace, alive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Arkryst tried to crush his foes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a final fatal dive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they dove clear, and ere his foes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He with his breath could freeze&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The halfling nocked his swarmbow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They killed the beast with bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They unlocked a new adventure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With seven magic keys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And faced in ancient Runeforge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many stranger things than these&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of all their tales, as scary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as thrilling as you please,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll always get a laugh about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon and the bees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; It's basically some level-1 commoners vs a D10000 random magical effect table. Don't roll 9999.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be running it in a few weeks but I'm a bit concerned it's going to be hard to wrap up well. We'll only have a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

The plot is that a wizard shows up at your village looking for adventurers to test 300 ""glitchy"" wands of magic missile and is willing to pay you 1000 gold each to do so. To tidy up the use-magic-item plothole, I'm going to be saying they're prototypes designed to be used by the magically unskilled knights of the kings army, which also explains why they're glitchy. Each of the batch has been made with slightly different techniques and they want to find the method that works best. They came out here to find patriotic citizens away from potential spies who'll do this job for the good of the realm (expendable peasants far away from anything valuable who'll ask no questions when confronted with piles of gold).

&amp;#x200B;

There's a mineshaft full of gnolls to get them started with some ready test subjects and a rough map of the region.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to add brackets to the contract so they can cash-out for a partial payment every 25 wands, but that doesn't really help with wrapping up if they don't wish to. I'm thinking maybe having the wizard find them and pay them out anyway as their boss has realised what a terrible idea testing them this way was. But I'm not 100% sold on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also thinking about dialling down the number of missiles the wands make to force them to use more wands. Or at least making it so you can only hit a single target per use. The 3-session game documented above has only used about 75 of the 300 wands in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

For prep I'm going to have a bunch of character sheets partially filled out with the commoner stats ( core rules, page 449 ) so it'll just be naming &amp; quick dice rolling. I'll have some fully made out too in case.

I'm going to have a tonne of stickynotes ready to keep track of all the status effects they're likely to accumulate (with and without realising). And I'm going to have my one-minute egg-timer ready to break out in case metagaming delays the turns. I'll also have the secret copy of the wands effects so far, not just what the players interpret the effects to be.

Hello r/Pathfinder_RPG! I'm a long time DM of 8 years as well as a year long lurker on this subreddit. I finally finished the line art for my friend's character in my 1e homebrew campaign and decided to share it here! One of my favorite parts of this project was finding ways to fit every significant piece of equipment into the aesthetic and feel of my homebrew setting of ""Ouesteleaux""(Definitely not medieval France, pronounced 'West-uh-Low'). Try to find all of these items:

Masterwork Silver Dagger +1

Mithral O-Yori +3

Ring of Protection

Amulet of Natural Armor(Look for the snail shell/tooth thing)

Belt of Physical Perfection +4

Headband of Intelligence +4

Wand of Magic Missile +3

Cloak of Resistance +3

Boots of Speed

Ring of Invisibility

&amp;#x200B;

Mozgus Lecroix was a peasant child whose parents decided to hand him over to The Order of the Blue Rose during a time of extreme poverty in the hopes that he would be able to live a better life in service to Charlemagne the Ascended King of Humanity. Mozgus, being raised by a particularly adamant member of the church became a fanatic and left monastery life to smite evil wherever he could find it. He eventually persuaded a former sergeant of the Kingdom's finest shock cavalry and youngest of a prominent noble's seven sons(Art to follow soon!) and the two became the scourge of the Midnight Aristocracy's agents. It was recently revealed that Mozgus was ""Alchemically Enhanced"" by his former mentor found in service to the Three Faced Goddess of Death and possesses Barghest eyes which allow him to see in the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

I've run 6 player campaigns, 4 player campaigns, but this last one has been my absolute favorite despite being only a 2 person campaign. The combination of vague backstories, my players' intense enjoyment of their characters both in build and personality, as well as my efforts in world building and art creation have made it a total joy ride!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/bOYVTe6""&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

More out of self interest than anything, I wanted ideas for things to add to my campaign,  but I guess the invisible hand does exist, since, a lot of people enjoyed it and found it useful xD.

Anyway, some people suggested making the thread periodically and I have been thinking about it for a while. In the end I have started thinking that maybe they way I made it was not the best. I hoped for it to be a resource for GM's and putting all types of useful stuff into one post makes it kinda chaotic and not that useful.

My idea has been, therefore, to make periodical threads by subject, sort the threads by subject in a Google Doc and have it at the end of every thread.

**I wanted to ask if you can think of any different themes than the ones I came up with and how often do you think we should have one**

Current ideas for thread topics:

-Custom Content (homebrews): magic items, custom spells, classes, races, rules...

-Interesting Encounters

-Traps

-Puzzles

-Good habits/things to do for easier play

-NPCs/shops/towns

-General world tidbits (my orcs barter)

&lt;p&gt;The Misfortune Revelation from the Dual Cursed Oracle Archetype&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Misfortune (Ex): At 1st level, as an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any one d20 roll that it has just made before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. Once a creature has suffered from your misfortune, it cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1 day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just one questions&lt;/p&gt;

Anyways I was looking for suggestions on what to play next without overpowering the party which is comprised of

* A Dhampir swashbuckler who is our secondary form of DPS
* A half elf bard who also provides ranged damage
* A half elf ranger who provides another source of ranged damage
* A human barbarian (unchained) who acts as our DPS
* and finally a Sylph kineticist who provides some utility

I have considered playing a pact(HH)  exploiter wizard or an occultist arcanist for the fun of it and to do something more than just be another damage dealer but I am honestly open to any suggestions class-wise.

####Appearance  

This lanky dragon’s dappled grayish scales and sprawling wings shift and fade in color, blending in with the mist.

####CR   5
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Fogburst (Su) As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 × 5 feet from the center of the fogburst’s area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as obscuring mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Fogvision (Ex) A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation.

Misty Camouflage (Ex) A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed.

Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim’s allies can regroup and come to its rescue.

Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years.

A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

I am currently a level 5 almost level 6 human unchained zen archer in a rise of the runelords campaign. Everymans unchained zen archer seems to round off at level 13 with ki focus bow, giving me at least 7 levels to play with. I am interested in a possible dip into the arcane archer prestige class. I’m thinking of doing zen archer 13/Empyreal Sorcerer 1/ Arcane archer 3/ 3 either zen archer or sorcerer. Which level would be the most appropriate time to start the arcane archer multiclassing and what order should it be done in or would it be better to just stay full zen archer? 

For Ki powers, my DM is not allowing me to take the Qinggong power (so no barkskin), so what would be the best ki powers to invests in?

Also does a Ki focus property allow my monks unarmed strike damage to apply to my bow attacks or just the abilities used with an unarmed strike (ki strike, stunning fist, etc)?

Thanks in advance for the help and advice.

Two problems, inter-related, one of which is my fault:

I'm a new GM and this is my first campaign, and I have a problem with pacing and with social rolls. There were a couple of incidents where my players rolled high for something but didn't make an argument the NPC would find convincing, so I didn't let the argument succeed, which I probably should have done anyway. My player got mad about this after I did it twice, once to him and once to another character, since I wasn't rewarding high rolls. (I talked it out with my players and we decided that I should set the DCs according to the quality of their arguments. I did warn that I would set crappy arguments very high, though, since this is a talky game and they're putting all their points in Diplomacy now. I'm thinking of putting a cap on how many points you can have in it just so it's not roll-to-win for them.) This player was just trying to brute force his way through every social interaction by banging his staff on the ground and yelling what he wanted loudly, and then rolling Intimidate, which he put a ton of ranks in. When he did that again I wanted to make it more difficult/fun for him. He tried it and rolled really well. I don't think I handled it very well, but I said the DC was very high because the player didn't understand the NPC's native language and looked poorly on outsiders. He got upset, told me he was uncomfortable with me not rewarding a high roll, and had his character quit the main quest, go to the local university, and refuse to get back to the rest of the party until his character had learned the language.

(Later he said that he thinks playing a mentally unstable character was messing him up and causing him to act out like this, so we came up with a cool way to retire the character.)

In the last session, he rolled to understand some papers a scholar NPC wrote, and I told him they make no sense at all, which is useful information and not a reflection on his character's ability to understand something, which seemed to be understood. Unfortunately, I didn't really let him react to it or try to stop the scholar's mad plans before moving on with the scene, since again I'm a new GM and I sort of have pacing problems. We're running over Discord (text-based) and I try to avoid having two minutes of everyone sitting there in silence while my players decide whether or not they want to type something. It's a delicate balance. So understand that I did make a mistake and he was already upset that session, and that I've made some bad calls on how to reward high rolls before.

But later in the session, during the final scene: he and his character expressed a repeated desire to help an NPC who was Balefully Polymorphed. The session before last I gave him a cursebreaker. The NPC insisted several times that he didn't want to be helped and to only reverse the curse if there's an emergency. I put the NPC in the game so that my players had a nuke they could set off if it looks like they were heading towards a TPK or other disaster, and the players know that. The NPC didn't want them to know that if they reversed the curse he'd likely die in a few minutes, just long enough to help them, because he thought they'd never use the cursebreaker if he did. (Probably true, he's a well-loved NPC.) Despite having a lot of warning both IC and OOC that using the cursebreaker would have unknown consequences, and that the NPC was terrified of its use, and that the party debated IC that he shouldn't do it, my player set the cursebreaker off at the end of the session anyway. (By the way, there were some hints in the game as to what would happen to the NPC if they referred back to certain events, but those happened so long ago I don't really count them.)

So after the session was over my player got angry and told me that he's not satisfied with the quality of the game the past few sessions, he wants his character to accomplish something right, and he's uncomfortable. (He did say he doesn't understand why he's uncomfortable, so he's as confused as I am right now.) 

I can see his point of view, and I should have given him an opportunity to stop the scholar, but I feel like what he did to the NPC merits the consequences. I'm not sure if he feels like I was setting him up to fail because I gave him a cursebreaker after him telling me he wanted to break the curse, and also didn't tell him what would happen if he used it, or if he should just accept the consequences of his actions since he was given ample warning both IC and OOC that the NPC would suffer if he did it.

Some more history: 

- the last character he played got tons of attention. He got to romance an NPC, solve the quest of the last arc (and arguably the arc before that too), and the death of that character after he wanted to retire him was designed to be very cool and introduce the campaign's villain. He gets more attention than any other PC and is usually the one suggesting a course of action. So it's not for a lack of participating in the plot, and he's had several incredible victories. Sometimes I sort of have to arrange things so that other characters get the spotlight, for instance, a character he says his PC has a crush on is interested in a different PC, so he won't be having a romance this arc. I don't know if his problem with the game comes from not getting to be the hero all the time.

- he does have a habit of getting uncomfortable and leaving the table, as I illustrated in the language example. A few sessions ago the group did a pretty standard ""somebody at the ball is an assassin, covertly find out who it is and stop them"" and he tried to solve it by shouting that a murder was about to take place, and an NPC quietly told him that he could ruin the target's reputation if he did that. (I was willing to let it play out his way so I wasn't railroading him, but I did want it known that this was a factor in why they asked the party to do it discreetly and there would have been consequences for the NPC.) But then he said he was uncomfortable playing out something so confrontational (he really likes using the word uncomfortable) and left the table again, I just had the guards take his character off for questioning and proceeded as usual.

All of my other players are comfortable and fine with everything I've done, and we've had open and fruitful negotiations about how to handle stuff like PvP when it comes up, or my issue with social rolls. None of them have exhibited anything close to this player's behavior, so I can't figure out where it's coming from or how to fix it. Aside from rewarding good rolls (and there've been dozens of them I've successfully rewarded and only these two or three I've really fucked up on) which we agree I need to work on.

Aside from all this I can't think of anything I've done wrong. Sorry if the post is long, I wanted to be exhaustive about it. 

Mostly, I'm concerned about the next session. The NPC is going to seriously suffer next session and possibly die. They'll have a good chance to save him and his life might otherwise be spared, but it's probably going to be legitimately uncomfortable knowing that your PC did that to a character you loved when you didn't mean to do it. I want to know what to do to keep him calm and prevent him from leaving the table in the middle of the session, especially if he rolls badly and something he tries doesn't work.

Does anybody have any idea why this player is getting repeatedly upset, what I'm doing wrong, and how to get him to relax? I can't figure out if I'm being too harsh or if he's just upset that not everything goes well for him.

&lt;p&gt;All of my other players are comfortable and fine with everything I&amp;#39;ve done, and we&amp;#39;ve had open and fruitful negotiations about how to handle stuff like PvP when it comes up, or my issue with social rolls. None of them have exhibited anything close to this player&amp;#39;s behavior, so I can&amp;#39;t figure out where it&amp;#39;s coming from or how to fix it. Aside from rewarding good rolls (and there&amp;#39;ve been dozens of them I&amp;#39;ve successfully rewarded and only these two or three I&amp;#39;ve really fucked up on) which we agree I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from all this I can&amp;#39;t think of anything I&amp;#39;ve done wrong. Sorry if the post is long, I wanted to be exhaustive about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I&amp;#39;m concerned about the next session. The NPC is going to seriously suffer next session and possibly die. They&amp;#39;ll have a good chance to save him and his life might otherwise be spared, but it&amp;#39;s probably going to be legitimately uncomfortable knowing that your PC did that to a character you loved when you didn&amp;#39;t mean to do it. I want to know what to do to keep him calm and prevent him from leaving the table in the middle of the session, especially if he rolls badly and something he tries doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have any idea why this player is getting repeatedly upset, what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong, and how to get him to relax? I can&amp;#39;t figure out if I&amp;#39;m being too harsh or if he&amp;#39;s just upset that not everything goes well for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I want some other GM's opinions on what you would do in this scenario.

Overview: I am running my first live campaign (ie not on Roll20) of the Giantslayer AP. Currently in Book 1. My 4 players are all pretty green to tabletop RPG's generally, and is the first campaign ever for 3 of them. I'm still at the stage where my players are still developing agency in looking up rules/always putting me on the spot to know what can be done when they do something unexpected. It's not bad, but I get overwhelmed by stuff like the following:

The party made the very foolish decision of splitting the party during the most significant combat portion of the book. Being the kind of GM that I am, I don't want to pull punches, so 2 members (the ranger and the cleric) of the party get backed into a burning building by 3 orcs, an encounter which they are overmatched (because the book is written that assumes the party won't split in a war zone).

The cleric, feeling she doesn't have alternative, runs out past the lead orc to get out the burning building and corner they have gotten themselves backed into. The lead orc crits on his AoO with his falchion – which mathematically should have killed the cleric (damage in excess of their CON) and, because the players agreed to subscribe to my rather lethal critical hit/fumble charts, removed her shield arm at the wrist.

It was at this point, that our session last week ended, as one player had to go catch a bus.

Now, the cleric will expend Hero Points (following RAW in their use), at the start of next session to not die/keep their hand. At this point, Paizo says it is at my discretion how I enable the cleric to cheat death.

&amp;#x200B;

There some factors that I am having difficulty weighting:

1) The players are new, including the cleric. They are still learning the rules, and have no concept of Pathfinder's metagame (ie splitting the party at such a critical time is always going to be a poor choice).

2) I made the ruling because of the split, that it will take another 2 rounds before the rest of the party catches up (the bard and fighter were dealing with a different conflict, which they actually succeeded brilliantly at).

3) I am concerned that if I let the cleric go unconscious here (with all the party's heals), as suggested by the Hero Points rules, that it will lead to a death spiral, as the players are not great at tactics and managing action economy, and are basically going to end up coming up to the orcs one at a time.

4) At the same time as all this, I want to be fair and honest, and teach them that their decisions have consequences.

5) my inclination immediately following the end of last session was to let the cleric avoid death and dismemberment, but drop them to dangerously low hitpoints, effectively using their Hero Points to make the orc fail to confirm the crit. Then say something at the time, or after the fight, about how the campaign is designed around them staying together to avoid situations like this in the future (they haven't done anything this foolhardy so far), and then be unforgiving about such errors in the future.

I am a sorcerer(Djinni bloodline) 9 in an Emerald spire campaign.

Recently, I have taken the feat Eldritch heritage(Arcane) to get a monkey familiar with the elemental(Fire) archetype.

At 11th level, I will take the improved familiar feat but I still want a fire monkey. Therefore, I have created a custom familiar based on the faery dragon's stat block. I would really like it if someone could tell me if it is balanced and witch things should I change to make it balanced.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Elemental Projectile(Ex)**

As a standard action, a scorching capuchin can instantly ignite a small object in its hands and throw it at a target within 30ft. as a ranged touch attack. Upon impact, it deals 1d6 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has and can ignite flammable objects. This ability can be used once every 1d4 rounds.

**Burning Bond (Ex)**

As a move action, a scorching capuchin can enter the skin of a willing creature that has no resistance or immunity to fire. He then transforms into a burn on the skin of that creature. When doing so, he deals 1d4 fire damage to the host creature upon entering his body. In this form, the scorching capuchin can not be targeted or attacked directly and only takes half damage when the host is damaged by an area of effect spell.  Also, he cannot take any action except to exit the host creature as a move action.

The scorching capuchin can also use this ability offensively. In this case, it takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the scorching capuchin must also succeed at a melee touch attack to enter an unwilling creature with no resistance or immunity to fire. If the scorching capuchin succeeds, he may enter the skin of the creature and deal 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has to the creature. Each round the scorching capuchin stays in the skin of the creature, the creature must make a DC 14 fortitude save. If it succeeds the scorching capuchin is expelled from it’s skin. If it does not succeed, it take 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has. The scorching capuchin may also exit the creature as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Fire-like Fur(Ex)**

The scorching capuchin’s body is covered in a special fur that has many fire-like properties. First, the fur glows as if the scorching capuchin were affected by the light spell. This effect does not work if the scorching capuchin is using his Burning Bond ability. Second, the scorching capuchin can produce heat with its fur. Anyone striking the scorching capuchin with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of fire damage.

**Spells**

Harsk meanwhile, doesn’t just look like a *shorter, stouter human* the deep brow and large nose ridge along with the sharp cheek bones leave him with a visage that is close but defined enough to look like a separate race of beings. Hell it’s almost like depictions of Neanderthals.

Ezren and Kyra don’t look to have changed all that much in my opinion and Fumbus is completely new since Damiel...is apparently having something canonical occur to him at the end of Tyrant’s Grasp.

####Ecology  

The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.

A hippogriff’s feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff’s torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.

Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.

Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature’s wings—these saddles are always exotic saddles.

Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young—as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff’s egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load.

I’ve recently become interested in playing a dark tapestry mystery oracle and have been having some difficulty choosing the right curse.

These are all class features of the two weapon warrior archetype: I was considering adding them as feats considering that the archetype is generally considered trash.  


  

Double Strike

Prerequisites improved Two weapon fighting, Bab +6

As a standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.  


Improved Balance

Improved Two weapon Fighting, bab +8

The attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by –1 for a two-weapon warrior. Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties.

  
Equal Opportunity

Improved Two Weapon fighting, Double Strike, Bab +11

when You make an attack of opportunity, you may attack once with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.

I'd appreciate any feedback and thanks for looking.  


Questions to consider:  
Does adding these as feats add to or take away from the game in general?  


What are fair prerequisites? I put in placeholders that I think are fair on the surface but I didn't put in too much thought  


And finally should it be a BaB prerequisite or a fighter level prerequisite? Would it be broken to add these to the two weapon fighting combat style for rangers?

There is also mention of being able to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; a spell to alchemical use, be it support/offensive spells, how can I know which spell is actually convertible?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for my possible uneven english. and thank you in advance!  &lt;/p&gt;
