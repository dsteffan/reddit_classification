They were wary of the obelisk, and would have avoided it until they inspected it a little more closely.  They saw an additional bit of writing saying ""You might be lucky to win a prize!"" Bait set.

The Dwarf of the team stuck her entire arm in the hole.

The obelisk also has writing around it saying things like &amp;quot;Bet you&amp;#39;re too scared to stick your arm in!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Only REAL adventurers are brave enough to stick their hands in!&amp;quot; They also heard the odd sound of &amp;quot;Cheep cheep cheep&amp;quot; like a chicken calling out to them from some unseen shadow. They were wary of the obelisk, and would have avoided it until they inspected it a little more closely.  They saw an additional bit of writing saying &amp;quot;You might be lucky to win a prize!&amp;quot; Bait set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dwarf of the team stuck her entire arm in the hole. The obelisk glowed a magical yellow starting from the bottom to the top. the moment it glowed around the arm their was a stinging sizzle and pop. No more right arm for the dwarf. She did get lucky though, and won a half-off coupon to &amp;quot;Glitter&amp;#39;s Prosthetic&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly drowning in the bathroom department, the party found Glitter&amp;#39;s shop in the kid&amp;#39;s section of the store, where the dwarf got a new arm from Glitter, a kenku who looked a bit like a toucan, for the low price of 20 gold thanks for the coupon (they started with 25 gold each).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dwarf enjoys her new arm a lot, for it punches well. Glitter enjoys her newly collected coin, cooing &amp;quot;cheep cheep cheep&amp;quot; as she counts it.&lt;/p&gt;

As our characters level, how do we thematically explain how our characters obtain these new fancy skills and abilities?

In regards to divine casters I think its a bit easier, for example:

You awake the next morning after a dream of your god (or what may have you) coming to you and blah blah you realize you have access to this new spell with the ability to know the somatic and verbal parts needed to cast it.

In regards to my future Kensei monk however, how would I explain that after X amount of weeks traveling with this group of people, he wakes up the next day and realizes he can speak and understand all spoken languages (Tongue of sun and moon)? Or the fighter realizing he can shoot an arrow that literally banishes the creature to another plan of existence (Banishing Arrow)?

Maybe I'm over thinking it but I feel that maybe the back story is supposed to cover these aspects? If thats the case, doesn't that kind of rob the DM of some creative aspects? 

All I wanted to do was create a cool middle aged monk (never played a monk), then my mind went to:

Wait... how do I go from a 30 something year old level 1 monk.. to learning how to use katanas... to unlocking cool monk stuff? So wait... my character is in his 30s... then all of a sudden over the course of several adventures he gets super strong?! 

Now all my mind can think of for a back story is that Chow Yun Fat movie Bulletproof-Monk where he just has some secret knowledge in him that unlocks intermittently. GRR!! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going through the process of creating a new PC (one of my favorite parts of DnD honestly).  So whilst on my creative journey of creating a Kensei Monk and coming up with his back story, it hit me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our characters level, how do we thematically explain how our characters obtain these new fancy skills and abilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to divine casters I think its a bit easier, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You awake the next morning after a dream of your god (or what may have you) coming to you and blah blah you realize you have access to this new spell with the ability to know the somatic and verbal parts needed to cast it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to my future Kensei monk however, how would I explain that after X amount of weeks traveling with this group of people, he wakes up the next day and realizes he can speak and understand all spoken languages (Tongue of sun and moon)? Or the fighter realizing he can shoot an arrow that literally banishes the creature to another plan of existence (Banishing Arrow)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m over thinking it but I feel that maybe the back story is supposed to cover these aspects? If thats the case, doesn&amp;#39;t that kind of rob the DM of some creative aspects? &lt;/p&gt;

My group had been playing Storm King's Thunder for almost a year and a half now, and after some crazy shenanigans we fought the last battle today against Iymrith, her two kids, and a bunch of purple wormlings today.  

Before the final battle, we got the Wyrm Claw and a potion of Giant Size.  Our leader, the Druid, got the Claw and my Sun Soul Monk, who does the most damage in melee, got the Potion of Giant Size.  So my DM really hates the Sun Soul Monk class.  He loves Monks, but the Sun Soul makes him angry because it can be a ranged monk, keeping the monk out of front line combat.

He played the Way of the Fist Monk in another campaign and he loved that character in combat.   He said it was high risk but high reward.

So, I'm pretty sure he did things to persuade me to go up and punch shit instead of spaming Hadoukens from 30 feet away.  Things like my character finding the Ilde Rune and him ruling I could add that extra D6 of fire damage to my punches (but specifically not the Hadoukens) and the Charm of the Slayer to my punches as well. I'm pretty sure that was because that feature annoyed of the class annoyed him so much.

Because of this, with Flurry of Blows, my damage was averaging about 45 per turn, out damaging the casters, fighter, rogue, and ranger at level 12 because it was consistent damage (20 points automatically if I make all four punches didn't hurt and my rolls are generally pretty decent). 

Now back to the Potion of Giant Size.  Normally it increases Strength, but he changed it due to my character being a petite wood elf, upping her Dex to 25 instead as well as tripling the amount of dice for each strike.

We got an army together and Harshnag (my monk's buddy - she was one of two people in the party who could speak giant, she actually knew what Force Gray was due to a good roll, was the one to first approach him to talk to him, and probably had the most interactions with him) to fight the dragons.

It was suggested that I didn't just gulp the potion right away (which in hind sight I should have, it would have made the entire battle easier).  So we killed the two adult blue dragons.  It was a fairly easy fight considering we were fighting two dragons (and I happened to double crit on a round of Flurry of Blows, which didn't hurt either).

Then of course Iymrith is pissed because we killed her kids, bursts out of the ground, and wrecks the party, knocking us back.  Poor Harshnag falls underground with the wormlings and we can't get within 20 feet of her because the ground around her is pretty much gone from her bursting out of it.  My now Giant Sized Wood Elf Monk has to throw some hadoukens, which was kind of hilarious when you think about it because they still did the normal amount of damage.

However, our druid leader had a great plan and managed to give us ground underneath the dragon again, bringing Harshnag into the fray once again as well.  Iymrith is still wrecking shit.  She kills our sorcerer to the point where he's failed two death saving throws.

Finally it's my turn again and Harshnag, our Fighter/Bard, an NPC Ranger (who is the GREATEST, but that's a story for another time), and I have flanked her, and our table has ruled that gives us Advantage if we're flanking an enemy (also gives enemies the same advantage as well).  I do Flurry of Blows with advantage on each of the four strikes.

Every one of them hits.

After I roll a lot of fucking dice I end up doing 141 points of damage, which was enough to finish the dragon.

But holy fucking shit, 141 points of damage as a giant elf literally beating a dragon to death with her fists.

I don't know if I'm ever going to top that in combat again.  I might have to retire as a melee player and switch to casters for a while, because holy shit I had a Kaiju Battle with a Dragon And Kicked Her Fucking Ass.

And, even more hilarious, my elf is super young.  She is literally just 18 years old.  Everything else is just going to be downhill from that. 

She is totally making a cape out of Iymrith's scales though to wear.

Things like my character finding the Ilde Rune and him ruling I could add that extra D6 of fire damage to my punches (but specifically not the Hadoukens) and the Charm of the Slayer to my punches as well. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that was because that feature annoyed of the class annoyed him so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, with Flurry of Blows, my damage was averaging about 45 per turn, out damaging the casters, fighter, rogue, and ranger at level 12 because it was consistent damage (20 points automatically if I make all four punches didn&amp;#39;t hurt and my rolls are generally pretty decent). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the Potion of Giant Size.  Normally it increases Strength, but he changed it due to my character being a petite wood elf, upping her Dex to 25 instead as well as tripling the amount of dice for each strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got an army together and Harshnag (my monk&amp;#39;s buddy - she was one of two people in the party who could speak giant, she actually knew what Force Gray was due to a good roll, was the one to first approach him to talk to him, and probably had the most interactions with him) to fight the dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was suggested that I didn&amp;#39;t just gulp the potion right away (which in hind sight I should have, it would have made the entire battle easier).  So we killed the two adult blue dragons.  It was a fairly easy fight considering we were fighting two dragons (and I happened to double crit on a round of Flurry of Blows, which didn&amp;#39;t hurt either).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then of course Iymrith is pissed because we killed her kids, bursts out of the ground, and wrecks the party, knocking us back.  Poor Harshnag falls underground with the wormlings and we can&amp;#39;t get within 20 feet of her because the ground around her is pretty much gone from her bursting out of it.  My now Giant Sized Wood Elf Monk has to throw some hadoukens, which was kind of hilarious when you think about it because they still did the normal amount of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, our druid leader had a great plan and managed to give us ground underneath the dragon again, bringing Harshnag into the fray once again as well.  Iymrith is still wrecking shit.  She kills our sorcerer to the point where he&amp;#39;s failed two death saving throws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally it&amp;#39;s my turn again and Harshnag, our Fighter/Bard, an NPC Ranger (who is the GREATEST, but that&amp;#39;s a story for another time), and I have flanked her, and our table has ruled that gives us Advantage if we&amp;#39;re flanking an enemy (also gives enemies the same advantage as well).  I do Flurry of Blows with advantage on each of the four strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every one of them hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I roll a lot of fucking dice I end up doing 141 points of damage, which was enough to finish the dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But holy fucking shit, 141 points of damage as a giant elf literally beating a dragon to death with her fists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ever going to top that in combat again.  I might have to retire as a melee player and switch to casters for a while, because holy shit I had a Kaiju Battle with a Dragon And Kicked Her Fucking Ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, even more hilarious, my elf is super young.  She is literally just 18 years old.  Everything else is just going to be downhill from that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is totally making a cape out of Iymrith&amp;#39;s scales though to wear.   &lt;/p&gt;

My party likes dungeons a lot, or bases or any type of complex they can infiltrate/invade and I don't wanna get a module that doesn't cater to that at all.

I guess what I'm looking for is a way to see what the various campaigns emphasizes, are they sandboxy, are there plenty of dungeons(with maps) etc. Googling doesn't seem to help me much tbh.

Can some arch DM who ran them all (or most) give me a quick rundown of them all and the style they use? Or at least throw me a link to a similar post?

Game

You are level 8 characters, and your goal is to kill the enemy team. Each team has a dragon egg that hatches into a young dragon (young black dragon stats, but they’re black/white in color). One egg is black, one egg is white. The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.

4 Zones

Forest:

Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a lightning storm. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 3d6 lightning damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Caves

A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled at the beginning of the round, acid begins to leak from the ceiling of the tunnels. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 3d6 acid damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Rocks

This area has a rocky surface with massive boulders jutting up from the ground. When a 3 is rolled at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the area. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 3d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Tower

The tower sits on a grassy surface, but the tower itself is 50 feet high and made of solid steel. The north and south sides of the tower have a hemp rope from top to bottom, and the east and west sides of the tower have metal chain ladders. A random level 6 spell scroll spawns at the top of the tower, and refreshes every three rounds. When a 4 is rolled at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a flames. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 3d6 fire damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Other stuff

Fountains

In each forested area, there is a fountain of regeneration. It has a pool of 100 health it can restore to those who drink from it. You can only heal at the fountain on your original side. You can damage the fountain to drain the remaining pool of health it has left. Fountain is immune to psychic damage, and has resistance to all damage besides magical bludgeoning damage.

Flames

In the white team side, a magical black flame exists in the rocky region. In the black team side, a magical white flame exists in the rocky region. This flame cannot be extinguished. Each player holds a magical bottle to capture some of this flame. When the flame is brought back to the egg of its respective color, it reduces the turns to hatch by 1. Players cannot hold more than one bottle at a time.

Death Slaad

The Death Slaad begins the game on top of the tower. It will begin the game pursuing the closest player it can see. The Death Slaad knows if someone is touching his tower, and will pursue them and ignore others for as long as they are touching it.

Actually becoming a fly is probably not worth it, as 8 levels of Druid is a big drain just to be able to Wildshape into a fly. However the idea still works if you were an ant or other non flying insect.

Monk (sunsoul) x/ Druid 2 (circle of spores)

The main idea here is to create utter chaos and confusion by wildshaping onto something very small, like and ant or spider, and then throwing monk sunbolts that seem to come out of nowhere.  Circle of spores has the best monk synergy in my opinion.

You could do things like creep onto a cave ceiling as a spider, rain down sunbolts, and drop down on an enemy once they figured it out or hit you with an AOE. If you could get to the enemy, you could transform back into a monk actually ON them.

They regularly appear low on everyone's tier list, and they are empirically the least played class. But they are fantastic. There are 3 reasons for this.

1. Wild shape is incredible. As a Moon druid it makes you the best tank and disabler in the game, edging out barbarian depending on opinion, and definitely at level 20. For any other circle it gives you an insane amount of flexibility anyway. You are now the best scout in the party, you now have every movement option (burrow, climb, fly, swim), you now have possibly the best disguise in the game outside a shapeshifter, you have an escape skill, you can break into places by turning into a spider without even needing to pick locks, and you can do it all twice on a short rest. Your very existence invalidates the party role of half the other classes. It is also the reason that Druids are probably the best one man party.
2. You are a full caster with a solid spell list for support.
3. Depending on DM ruling/on how kind your DM is in letting you influence, they have access to probably the two best spells in the entire game: Conjure animals (for 8 stags) and Conjure Woodland beings (for 8 pixies). This is a bit questionable, but even if your DM gives you other animals this can still be incredible, particularly as a circle of the Shepard giving them magic attacks and tripling their health with bear spirit.  


The only thing that they aren't good at is blasting. Their damage is fine (almost on par with fighters at low levels minus action surge) but not phenomenal (unless your DM is kind with animal selection for summon animals). But almost every other class does that to some degree. Further, I would encourage you to consider damage not in terms of damage/turn but rather in terms of damage before you die. Druids win the second hands down, even if their nova isn't so good.

In terms of subclasses, Moon and Sheperd are incredible. Moon makes you a godly tank. Shepherd makes everyone a godly tank, including the 8 minions you summoned at level 5 (looking at you bear spirit).  

Some of you are probably thinking ""derr druids are great this is such a pointless post."" This post isn't about you.

&lt;li&gt;Wild shape is incredible. As a Moon druid it makes you the best tank and disabler in the game, edging out barbarian depending on opinion, and definitely at level 20. For any other circle it gives you an insane amount of flexibility anyway. You are now the best scout in the party, you now have every movement option (burrow, climb, fly, swim), you now have possibly the best disguise in the game outside a shapeshifter, you have an escape skill, you can break into places by turning into a spider without even needing to pick locks, and you can do it all twice on a short rest. Your very existence invalidates the party role of half the other classes. It is also the reason that Druids are probably the best one man party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a full caster with a solid spell list for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on DM ruling/on how kind your DM is in letting you influence, they have access to probably the two best spells in the entire game: Conjure animals (for 8 stags) and Conjure Woodland beings (for 8 pixies). This is a bit questionable, but even if your DM gives you other animals this can still be incredible, particularly as a circle of the Shepard giving them magic attacks and tripling their health with bear spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that they aren&amp;#39;t good at is blasting. Their damage is fine (almost on par with fighters at low levels minus action surge) but not phenomenal (unless your DM is kind with animal selection for summon animals). But almost every other class does that to some degree. Further, I would encourage you to consider damage not in terms of damage/turn but rather in terms of damage before you die. Druids win the second hands down, even if their nova isn&amp;#39;t so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of subclasses, Moon and Sheperd are incredible. Moon makes you a godly tank. Shepherd makes everyone a godly tank, including the 8 minions you summoned at level 5 (looking at you bear spirit).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably thinking &amp;quot;derr druids are great this is such a pointless post.&amp;quot; This post isn&amp;#39;t about you. This is just a post for anyone who hasn&amp;#39;t played druid or who thinks they are bad. They are not. They are fantastic, and you should try one.&lt;/p&gt;

We've played a lot as players in a campaign in the last year, so now that I have a feel for 5e I thought I'd take out the boxed set and try to DM again. I've done a LOT more prep, including reading lots of amazing posts on running LMoP here on Reddit and I think we're ready to go. I figured I probably put in six hours of reading and prep for the first section, which should probably take the players two to three hours to get through (to the end of the Cragmaw hideout.)  I'm assuming DMing gets a little easier as you go, but would you say that's about right? A couple of hours of DM prep for every hour of player game time?  I think I might be a little over-prepared, actually - I wrote up combat blocks with key stats and spots to track initiative and hit points for all the expected encounters, plus a bunch of other cribbed notes from various posts I read. Then again, I don't know anything about the spells my wizard and ranger players can cast, so I'll have to be looking them up on the fly. Does it ever get so second nature that you can fly by the seat of your pants?

(Leaning towards taking 14th level Rogue for the Blind sense, but I don't know if it would be good spell slot-wise, and if it's needed since I may take 'Alert' as a feat instead of an Ability Score increase)

**1st question:** Can I have 2 archetypes at once? (College of Whispers and Arcane Trickster)

**2nd question:** How would I do spell slots? I have no idea what the grounded rules are, and if possible, I would love a solid explanation and/or source material for spell slots with a multiclass.

**3rd question:** Should I start as a Bard, reach 6th or 7th level, then switch to Arcane Trickster for the remaining 13 or 14 levels? Should I do the reverse?

**4th question:** Are my priorities stat-wise correct? What about which Features and Ability Score increase I should take? Which chosen Proficiencies and Expertise? (Definitely taking Stealth Expertise)

Extra Information: I have access to most books, but can easily find PDF's for the obscure ones.

I am playing a Lightfoot Halfling (+2 Dex +1 Cha after rolls)

Since we can sacrifice ability score increases for Features, I'm thinking about taking 'Lucky' and 'Alert'.

Lucky: (Can Reroll up to 3D20's per long rest)

Alert: (+5 Initiative. Cannot be surprised while conscious. Not affected by surprise attack bonuses)

I've googled around a bit and saw a couple other people have subbed in a drider and messed with other things as well to make the Nezznar fight less underwhelming. I've decided to make this a two-stage fight with Nezznar transforming into a magic-enabled Drider after he and his spiders (making this a phase spider and giant spider instead of 4x Giant Spider) are killed.

The party consists of 5 players who will likely be level 5 by this fight. If they're level 4 I'll tone down the fight a bit

### Phase 1:

Nezznar (CR 2)

Phase spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/phase-spider) (CR 3)

Giant spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider) (CR 1)

Quasit Familiar (still debating whether or not to have this, might be a bit tricky) [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit) (CR 1)

If I do include the quasit I'd have it disguised as a tarantula tracking the party throughout the dungeon with a couple opportunities to spot it and eliminate it for this fight. Additionally, it will void the contract with Nezznar as soon as he goes down (doesn't matter if the spiders are still up).

### Phase 2:

Magic-enabled Drider [stat block](https://i.imgur.com/QE2ZT39.png)

Any spell slots spent in previous stage remain spent. Kept his ""mental"" stats the same as the previous stage.  I've been debating nerfing the HP, or possibly keeping him at lvl 4 spellcasting instead of upping it to 5 (a little worried about vampiric touch, but counterspell would be fun). I'll probably give the party a very brief respite between the two phases (not a short rest but the cleric *could* cast cure wounds once or twice).

My players have also been both a bit loose with their resources and quick to flee and rest so I imagine they'll find a way to get to this fight with either much more or much less resources than expected of the fight.

### DMG CR Estimate for drider vs modified drider

Drider:  
Defense CR: 10 (19 AC: 17, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (28.5/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13: 0)  
Overall CR: 6  

Magic-enabled Drider:  
Defense CR: 7 (17 AC: 10, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (21-32/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13 &amp; concentration: 0)  
Overall CR: 5 (maybe a bit lower because of the lack of spellslots from the first wave and dependence on keeping vampiric touch concentration up for the higher damage output)

Nezznar could put out 32 damage per round if he can keep concentration on vampiric touch, but damage falls pretty quickly without that (down to offensive CR 3). I'm not too worried about it being too easy because they'll have just survived the previous fight so they should be pretty haggard by this point.

So that leaves me with one CR 6 (maybe 7) and one CR 5ish encounter right after the other with very little downtime. Is this okay? Any advice? Am I going to kill my party with this or is it relatively balanced?

&amp;#x200B;

In my upcoming campaign the party is investigating the underground depths of a massive superstructure known as the Citadel. After grinding through a planned 5-floor-deep dungeon, they will end up triggering an eldritch seal on the Citadel that causes them to be transported into a different realm. There, they will meet an ancient warrior who essentially guards this primordial force of death, a mass of the souls of everything that has died in this world, keeping it trapped underground beneath the Citadel, and that their breaking of this seal will cause this primordial force of death to eventually break free and wreak havoc on the world (dun dun DUN!).

In short, they learn of a ritual where those who trigger this seal are able to get a shot at taking the power of this force of death for themselves if they manage to get their hands on sacred artifacts held by the previous adventurers who broke the seal. However, as punishment for breaking the seal, the party members are also branded by a curse that grants them immortality, at a cost. Every time they die, they resurrect after 1d8 + (number of deaths) hours. However, each time they come back they suffer a temporary stat penalty which can be cleared by taking a long rest, though with enough deaths these penalties become permanent, with the seventh and final death causing them to go permanently insane and die for good. 

I'm wondering if anyone's tried a mechanic like this in the past. My main worry might be restricting the players from playing new characters, or the difficulty of meshing in a new character in with the party if one of the cursed members dies for good. Any thoughts? Suggestions? I'd appreciate them all.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

Stats (Each)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make with these magic weapons. On a hit with these weapons, the target takes an extra 2d4 piercing damage and 2d4 elemental damage.(fire, ice) 

Soulbound 
These weapons are soulbound to you during a ritual cast by an other worldly being. To work; this ritual requires the sacrifice of two magic weapons and the owners soul. As a result the magical weapons are destroyed and the owners soul is scarred, reducing one of their stats by 1.
Once complete the weapon's binding will leave a bonding point (rune/mark), with no fixed point, on the character's body as proof of the ritual. The weapon will be made of soul stone after this point, consisting of any color, texture and shape the owner wishes. All magic imbued into the original weapon is carried over to the soul-bound form.
Any Soul-bound weapon can be summoned instantaneously, in hand, as a Reaction, at the will of the owner. The owner may disband the item and have it return instantaneously to the void or bonding point where it's rune/mark is left on the owner. The weapons may be any distance from the owner and still respond to their call. They must remain on the same plane as the owner or they will be returned to the bonding point. Soul-bound weapons can never damage their owner, if such an opportunity occurs the weapon returns to the bonding point.While you wield this weapon, you also have resistance to the relevant damage type.

Ravens flight 
While wielding one dagger, the user may throw the other as a bonus action, after which the user will instantly teleport to its location, catch it, and attack the nearest creature. If you hit with this attack, the dagger deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage. A flurry of raven feathers are left at the previous location.

Dragons Breath
You imbue yourself with the power to spew magical energy from your mouth twice a day(once fire once cold). Until the spell ends, you can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Scaling 
Because these weapons are bound to your soul they get more powerful as you do!
Level 1: Soulbound Perks. +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with Sol. 
Level 2: +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with lua. 
Level 3: An extra 1d4 piercing damage with Sol. 
Level 4: An extra 1d4 piercing damage with lua. 
Level 5: An extra 1d4 fire damage with Sol.

The weapons may be any distance from the owner and still respond to their call. They must remain on the same plane as the owner or they will be returned to the bonding point. Soul-bound weapons can never damage their owner, if such an opportunity occurs the weapon returns to the bonding point.While you wield this weapon, you also have resistance to the relevant damage type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ravens flight 
While wielding one dagger, the user may throw the other as a bonus action, after which the user will instantly teleport to its location, catch it, and attack the nearest creature. If you hit with this attack, the dagger deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage. A flurry of raven feathers are left at the previous location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragons Breath
You imbue yourself with the power to spew magical energy from your mouth twice a day(once fire once cold). Until the spell ends, you can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling 
Because these weapons are bound to your soul they get more powerful as you do!

Level 2: +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with lua. 
Level 3: An extra 1d4 piercing damage with Sol.

Hello fellow adventurers,

I'm looking for players and DMs of all kinds. People taking their first step forward, to ancient veterans. We're a D&amp;D server with multiple types of games as we like variety. Unfortunately, players and DMs alike tend to flake out at random times, so we prune regularly to remove inactive people. So we're all pretty active. Fun conversation and exciting revelry await for those who are interested. We're all from different timezones so people are always available around the clock. If this sounds like your kind of adventure, please click the link below. Please be communicative and serious players. I don't mind busy schedules, but at least give prior notice before leaving.

To be frank, this isn't a plea to min-max my character per se, I am not looking to do the most damage or outshine my party..just be competent in the Curse of Strahd setting while not crippling my own character progression.

At the table we have a Paladin, Druid, Cleric who are confirmed, with me and another PC with TBA character sheets. I am heavily leaning towards a rogue but I haven't really figured out how best I can build my character to complement my teammates let alone if this class is viable in CoS. We are all starting at Lvl 1 and our books are limited to the PHB.

My current thinking was to:

* Take the stout-halfling for the +2 dex and +1 con (also get the trait lucky)

* Skills in: Stealth, sleight of hand, perception, deception,  

* Expertise in Stealth and Slight of Hand

* Background: Criminal

* Weapons &amp; armour: Rapier and leather armor 

* At lvl 3 and beyond : Take the Assassin archetype. No idea about feats and such (any advice would be appreciated)

Basically, an NPC ""holds the party prisoner until they entertain him"", and they get a reward for it.

I like this, and sort of want to use it as a possible option for an NPC encounter in my upcoming campaign.

They aren't too pleased to entertain visitors, and as an Neutral Evil Evoker, a certain fondness for watching people crumble to ash is present. Still, the party catches our master-evoker on a ""good day"", and they are given a chance to earn their safety. Play a song, do some tricks, whatever, just entertain their ""host"" (three successful DC 25 (expected level 13+) skill checks before three failed checks), and be allowed to leave, without getting incinerated.

The catch here is I assume that *just* getting their safety is sort of jerkish of me, so I think if they did well, said wizard should maybe actually REWARD them for their efforts. Here's where we come to my problem; I can't hink of anything. ;)

In particular, ""You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some  kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature."" This is stronger than the language requiring other spellcasters to have a focus if they want to avoid needing other material components: an artificer *needs* a focus for *all* spells, even ones that don't have a material component, and including cantrips. Also, ""After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.""
* Infuse Item: No tools required, but you need a target: ""Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.""
* Tool Expertise: Useless without tools.
* Arcane Armament: Requires a magic weapon.
* The Right Cantrip for the Job: Useless if you can't cast cantrips because you have no tools.
* Spell-Storing Item: Requires either a weapon or a spellcasting focus.
* Soul of Artifice: Relies on magic items.
* Alchemist:
   * Alchemical Homunculus: Requires alchemist's supplies to summon or revive.
   * Alchemical Mastery: Requires alchemist's supplies.
   * Chemical Savant: Resistance always works. *Greater restoration* requires alchemist's supplies.
* Artillerist: Note that you can now use rods, staffs and wands as spellcasting focuses.
   * Arcane Turret: Requires smith's tools.
   * Wand Prototype: Requires woodcarver's tools to imbue a wand.
   * Fortified Position: Enhances Arcane Turret.

Now, I actually think that this is a good thing. If any class is going to be in trouble without their equipment, it's the artificer. I think it's interesting that they're even worse off than a wizard if they get thrown in a dungeon without their stuff.

Anyway, this has some interesting tactical implications. Firstly, it removes one of my usual reasons for taking an attack cantrip, that being ""I want to be able to fight even if I lose all my stuff"". Very few attack cantrips have material components, the exceptions being Infestation, Thorn Whip and Word of Radiance. But as an artificer, I can't cast anything at all without my tools, and if I still have my tools, I probably still have my crossbow, so attack cantrips lose some of their utility there.

Secondly, it behooves an artificer to have some kind of recovery strategy for if they lose their gear. One approach is to make sure you choose an infusion that works on a common item, since infusions don't require tools, and an infused item can be used as a spellcasting focus. The obvious way is to choose Enhanced Weapon, which many artificers will do regardless. Then, if you lose everything, you can bootstrap your way back to spellcasting by finding or making a weapon - even if that means turning a tree branch into a club - and then taking a long rest, then imbuing the weapon and using it as a focus to prepare and cast your spells. That won't let you use Magical Tinkering or any of your specialty abilities, though.

Another approach is to be proficient with a tool kit that is easily obtainable. I recommend Cook's Utensils - you can find cooking supplies in the kitchen of the nastiest orc fortress or kobold warren, and they cost one whole gold piece in the marketplace. It won't be enough for your specialty abilities, but you'll get your spellcasting back immediately.

In theory, at high levels, you could get hold of a focus (cheap tools or an imbued weapon) and then use Fabricate to create whatever tools you want, as long as you have the right proficiency to make the tools. That's probably a better bet for the Artillerist, since smith's tools would be the proficiency to make most tool kits, including more smith's tools. I can't think of any other way to obtain tools magically *ex nihilo* \- Leomund's Secret Chest requires you to have the replica chest on hand. Maybe your GM will let you use the Many-Handed Pouch infusion to add a new pouch (looted from your goblin jailer) to an existing pouch network, in which you've stored the LSC replica chest, allowing you to summon your chest which contains backup tools and other emergency supplies, but I don't think that's quite RAW.

Anyway, I just think the tool aspect of the artificer is interesting, and makes for an entertaining and intriguing new approach to spellcasting and other class features. Any thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just created a level 1 artificer for a new game, and I&amp;#39;ve noticed that they&amp;#39;re really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dependent on their tools to use their class features. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magical Tinkering: Requires thieves&amp;#39; tools or artisan tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spellcasting: Requires a focus. In particular, &amp;quot;You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some  kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature.&amp;quot; This is stronger than the language requiring other spellcasters to have a focus if they want to avoid needing other material components: an artificer &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a focus for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; spells, even ones that don&amp;#39;t have a material component, and including cantrips. Also, &amp;quot;After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Alchemist:

A little background first, our group consists of 6 people, 4 of them have previous DnD experience (however afaik it's the DMs first time, well, DMing). I don't but I have a background in RPing in MMOs, the latest being ESO with a system similar enough to DnD to compare the two. With that being said I'll jump right into it

A) Barely any IC action during combat  


What I mean by that is that player characters don't really talk during combat, like we don't come up with strats, don't communicate our next action so our allies can act with us on it. In ESO it felt a lot more dynamic with players interacting with each other, examples I remember from the top of my head would be;  

A1) In the middle of a bloody fight our Barbarian (obviously it wasn't called that in ESO but he was pretty much a textbook Barbarian) told me (a Spellblade Dark Elf - probably akin to Arcane Trickster/Hexblade) to back him up as he wanted to rush the head of the group we were fighting to put an end to it so I went with him expended my last few spells to clear a line for him and then hold off his allies while the Barbarian engaged in one to one combat.  

A2) Mages conjuring up a powerful spell and yelling at the party to get out of the way before unleashing it or 
putting a status debuff on an enemy and then yelling ""Go! Now!"" or something similar to indicate the priority target.



B) ""Bosses"" show clear signs of intellect but behave like video game bosses  


So far we're only 2 sessions in but what struck me as odd is that the Kobold Captain we fought never bothered to command his underlings. He made deragatory remarks towards our party so he was clearly intelligent yet seemed perfectly content to have his underlings spread out and die while just hitting the ""tank"" himself. Another example would be a conjured Manticore grinning at someone missing an attack but also falling into the pattern of just hitting the ""tank"" when there's much bigger threats in our party.  
This makes it feel a little underwhelming since our party set up is far from optimal; we have 2 sorcerers, one wizard, a fighter archer and a paladin who's the only melee. I feel like bosses should move around more and if they have allies should command them in a more efficient way to either punish us for our poor party set up and also for our complete lack of tacticts. 

With the points mentioned above combat feels a lot like we're just repeatedly rolling die until the thing is dead and should we ever lose a fight it's because we didn't roll the die well enough, not because we were poorly prepared or for a lack of strategy.  
It's also annoying because I don't get to flesh out my character during combat situations, which, considering it's DnD, are rather frequent so a pretty big part of the game.

With all that being said I'd like to point out that I'm not necessarily having a bad time, the RP outside of combat feels adequate and I like the people I'm playing with, I just feel like it could be a lot more lively at certain points.

The most recent adventure we just finished was White Plume Mountain...which they kind of breezed through, casually bypassing most of the major dangers.

The party was a tempest cleric, a lore bard, a shepherd druid, and a war wizard 6/fighter 2

First they took the left path. When they reached the super tetanus room, fearing floor traps the cleric used control water to raise the water level from the hallway above into the chamber.  He then dropped water walk on the party and they strolled right across.  When they found the floating river, the druid shifted into an octopus, went against the current, saw the waiting knights, and decided not to fuck with them. Finally when the reached the inverted ziggurat, the party threw out a couple shatters, left the room, and decided to let the monsters fight each other and come back in a few hours. On their way back through the tetanus room the water had receded, but there was still water filling the pits. One ritual water walk later and even though they slid across the hall they walked right across the pits.

Next they reached the middle path. When they reached the giant crab in the boiling bubble they 1) intentionally burst the bubble, 2) retreated through the doors, 3) let the crab boil, 4) cleric used control water to red sea the boiling lake, and 5) sent in the wizard (a fire ganasi) to loot the chest.

Finally they took the right path. After water walking over the hidden green slime they reached the glass orbs room. The cleric dropped spirit guardians and just maintained it for 10 minutes, killing all the monsters in the orbs. When they broke the orb with the talking ring, the instantly distrusted it and mage handed it out of the room with nobody putting it on. In the bit with the flesh golems they got the right answer, then proceeded to name their new companion Gregory.  

Then they reached the geysers and chains room.. Immediately forgoing trying to actually brave the chains and discs, they went back into the hallway as the wizard ritual cast floating disc. When that was done, they waited for both geysers to burst, loaded the golem and bard onto the disc, wizard used fly on himself, flew across the chamber, and lowered a rope to the 2 on the disc. Meanwhile the bard shrunk himself and took a ride on the wild shaped druid.

When they finally reached the vampire the tempest cleric, who entered the dungeon already worshiping sea gods, used wave to create a cube of force to keep the vampire out. They then spammed spells at the vampire while the flesh golem beat the vampire senseless. On a side note, why the fuck does a cr5 flesh golem have magical attacks but a cr 13 fucking vampire not?

Hello r/dndnext! I have DMed a few one-shots in my time, but I have had some grand plans and am now setting up my first long-term game, which will be happening over this summer, and hopefully future summers to come. One of my players has decided to be a Warlock, which is already fantastic. To make things better, he let me choose the subclass he would be playing (with his input as well). Here's the sparknotes of his backstory:

\- A Dragonborn found, abandoned, by a human/elf couple (the mother was human and in her mid to late thirties)

\- Mother was a priest of Erathis (the Lawbearer), so he worked as a priest as well

\- Eventually, he began clerical training under a childhood friend of his: Birel, a female elf

\- The High Priest had to interrupt their training to send her on a mission that she hasn't returned from

\- Upon asking about her, the High Priest simply tells him that the mission was confidential, and that he should pray for her return

\- He also essentially indefinitely put his training on hold, never assigning a new trainer to him

\- The PC is now in his 40s, and his mother has died of old age

\- The PC is going through a bit of a crisis, feeling as though his loved ones are all starting to disappear, and is angry at the Lawbearer and High Priest for their complacency

\- He decides to intensely research other avenues of power, specifically Celestial power

Long story short, he makes a pact with a being whom claims to be a Celestial; Loviana. Loviana *was* her name, at least. She is an Empyrean, a daughter of Erathis. However, she was influenced by the chaotic nature of Erathis' lover, Melora, and was also a more rebellious soul. She and Erathis had a falling-out and she fled from the Celestial plane she inhabited, instead choosing to wander the planes. She finally encountered the Abyss, and the plane that Tharzidun, the Chained Oblivion, had been sealed away in. She was slowly corrupted, changing her name to Sifrilana and becoming something close to the Forgotten Realms' Loviatar -  an intermediate goddess of punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, given the PC's current attitude, what would be some ways to mess with him via his patron? As far as he's convinced, he has made a pact with a Celestial who, after a decent Religion check, determined her to have a faint link with the Lawbearer. His real class is Hexblade, so I have pretty free reign as far as flavoring. 'Loviana' has spoken to him once, when he made the pact, and I intend their interactions to last and change up through level 20, if I can keep the game going as long. **In conclusion, what are some ways I can both challenge his PC, mess with his mind, and slowly reveal his patron's true nature?**

The DM then uses the backstories to build an adventure that incorporates all the PCs stories and ideas and some NPCs. 

For example, one player has a mentor that disappeared, last seen with a mysterious figure. They want to find the mentor. 

Another player has an old, close friend who made some bad choices and is in a nearby town probably being evil. They want to try to save the friend. 

Etc. 

The DM then works to find a way to tie these stories together (mentor was taken in by the old close friend, for example). 

This way everyone in the party feels they are following their PCs goals and stories. They are motivated by PCs own story. They’re not just going to check out the goblin caves in the nearby forest because that’s what adventurers do.

But it was necessary. Shortly after saving the children from the Piper, wanted posters had started appearing all over town; wanted posters that obviously described Cassandra. The only thing that didn’t match was the white dress; Cassandra never wore white.

It must be the changing Etna taking on Cassandra’s form so that she might more easily wreak havoc upon the land.  

The decision was made that she had to get out of town. So she, Two-Penny, Emmalite, and Percy, set out on the Great West Road to Dagger Falls. 

After nearly a month and a few bounty hunters later, they finally reached the Green Walls of Dagger Ford. The wanted posters had gradually decreased in frequency as the traveled until finally they hadn’t seen one in over a week. Time for a well-deserved rest. 

After a hot bath and hearty meal of fruits, vegetables, and a few too many potatoes (the Dalelanders were obsessed with potatoes), Cassandra was ready for her first night sleep in a bed in over a fortnight. 

She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. A deep, sweet repose full of dreams of music and sunlight, and better days. A perfect sleep. Until . . . 

Suddenly rough hands were pinning her down. An acrid smell, unwashed bodies, tobacco, cheap beer, filled the room. Cassandra was able to let out one shrill scream before a cloth covered her nose and mouth and the room started to spin. The last thing she remembered was being roughly shoved into a bag

She came to some time later, gagged, blindfolded, and bound. She could tell she was in a wagon moving fast. But not her wagon. Her wagon was home. It smelled of flowers and sunshine.  This wagon stank of rotten meat, stale clothes, and filth. 

After a few hours, the wagon stopped. She could hear men’s voices, rough and crude, an accent not unlike Two-Penny’s. 

“We’s gots to feed the bitch. If’n she dies ‘for Crumpet gets his prize, there’ll be hell to pay,” one of them was saying. 

“We’ll just take out the gag . . . she’ll swallow anything we put’s in her mouth!” the other replied. The both got a laugh out of that.

The gag was removed, “Here lady, You’s got a keep up yer strength. Have some of this fine salted pork,” A lump of cold pork was shoved into her mouth. 

“Stop it you!” she screamed, spitting it out, “I can’t eat meat!” Cassandra sobbed. 

“Fine. More there is fer us, then. At least have something to drink. Hold her mouth open, I’ll pour.” Strong, rough hands, took hold of her hair and chin and pried her mouth open. She could feel a bottle against her lips and a burning liquid poured into her throat. Then her mouth forced shut until she swallowed. The thugs repeated this several times, until the will to fight back drained out of Cassandra and she passed out drunk.

They spent at least two days on the road like this, until they arrived at what turned out to be a large town. After a time on cobbled streets, every bump a knife in her sore back, they stopped and she was lifted out of the wagon and carried into a building. The smell of cooking food told her she was in a kitchen. 

She was laid out on a table, like a sacrificial feast, held fast at the wrists and ankles. The sound of boots on flagstone striding into the room filled her with dread.

And then, an elegant but cold man’s voice, “Good work my lads. You’ll be handsomely rewarded for this. Now, let us have a look at my bride-to-be . . .”

The blindfold was removed, the gag taken out. “Ah, she is quite the beauty. My dear, you have the honor of soon becoming Lady Crumpet,” he looked her up and down. Spread out on the table like this, with that leer in his eye, it was surprising he didn’t lick his lips. “You are allowed to show your pleasure.”

Cassandra was barely able to speak, “Pleasure? I’d rather spit in your face, you loathsome troll!”

His response was immediate, a hard backhand across the face. “I like a bit of defiance in my women. But I’ll soon tire of that then you’ll have to be broken just as one of my horses.”

Turning to the thugs, “Give her to the maids to get cleaned up . . . the wedding is at dusk.”

The gag and blindfold were put back in place and a cloth again covered her nose. In just a few moments, Cassandra was unconscious. 

When she woke, she was strapped to a chair in front of a dressing table, a large mirror before her. She had been bathed, her hair had been braided and coiled on her head in the shape of cone with a white tassel crowning it. 

Her face had been powdered white, her checks rouged, her lips painted red. On most any other woman, this would have been beautiful. On Cassandra, it made a mockery of her wild, untamed splender. 

She was dressed in what some women would say was a beautiful white gown. To Cassandra, it was uglier and more constraining than the leather straps binding her to the chair. 

As her head cleared, she began to take in her surroundings. She was in an elaborate dressing room, pink and frilly. Silver and lace adorned every surface. 

And then, in the mirror, she saw Her . . . she saw the Witch. 

Most people wouldn’t have known she was a witch. But Cassandra knew. Her people knew witches . . . they were haunted by witches. 

To the casual observer, she was a tall, lithe, elegant lady with a lordly bearing and a sophisticated air about her. But Cassandra saw through it all. To Cassandra, she was an aged, withered hag. 

“Ah my dear. Within the hour, you shall become my daughter. I know you resist. And I know also that it is in vain. When my spell takes you, your will shall writhe and struggle and fight. But it will be of no use. Your body will do as it’s told. The more you fight it, the sweeter your surrender.”

Not many would have missed her laugh was the cackle of a witch. 

She leaned in and whispered words into Cassandra’s ear, words that could only be heard but never remembered. Words that melted on the memory as snowflakes in the palm of your hand.

“Smile, my pretty,” she said when the spell was complete, “your wedding day is upon you.”

Cassandra fought not to smile but it was useless. She beamed into the mirror the most beautiful of smiles as the Witch removed the straps that held her down. 

“Come my dear, go to the altar and marry my son. The honeymoon bed awaits.”

Cassandra rose and followed her to the door, still smiling, a single tear running down her cheek. 

As she reached the door, the wedding march started to play. 

As she approached the altar and lord Crumpet, five young women dressed in gaudy gowns, fell in step behind her. At the altar, he heard Crumpet, saying to the priest “Let us hurry this up, shall we? After this is consummated I have card game to get to.”

It was like a nightmare that she couldn’t wake up from. It was happening so fast. All hope was lost . . . there was no way out.

“Dearly beloved,” droned the priest, “We have gathered here this evening to witness the joining of this couple in wedlock.”

Cassandra’s eyes were pleading with the priest to stop but she knew it was to no avail. 

But then, as the priest continued, he looked at Cassandra with a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes and he winked. Then blew a kiss to someone in the audience. A glimmer of hope shot through Cassandra. 

“Does anyone here tonight, have cause why these two should not marry?” asked the priest of the crowd.

“What, other than he being a complete bastard? I can’t think of thing.” It came from the stage, from one of the musicians. 

Crumpet stammered and turned, obviously shocked that anyone would dare to do such a thing. When he saw who had dared, his eyes narrowed and he screamed “TWO-PENNY!!!”.

Jack “Two-Penny” Rasp stood defiantly on the stage, a broad and smug smile on his face. Handing his fiddle to one of the musicians, he jumped down to the ballroom floor.

“Two-Penny! I’ll have your hide for boots you scamp!” Crumpet was apoplectic, frothing at the mouth, eyes bulging.

If anything, Two-Penny’s smile got broader. “Doomsdale?” he called out and from the ample bodice of one of the bridesmaids’ gowns, pop went the weasel. Doomsdale was flurry of furry fury. A terror to behold. First, in one of the women’s hair, then climbing up the leg of another. Biting, growing, hissing. She sent the bridesmaids into a shrieking panic, blocking the path between Two-Penny and Crumpet. 

As Crumpet tried to force his way through them, Two-Penny called out again . . . “Oh children?” 

Four of the baker’s assistants, actually ruffian urchins hired by Two-Penny, knocked over the table holding the wedding cake. The cake wasn’t a normal cake. Magics cast by Emmalite had rotted it to the core. When it broke apart, a foul stench filled the room.

The children then rushed into the guests, molesting them heartily . . . grabbing at anything that looked valuable . . . rings, necklaces, silverware, gold teeth. The crowd went mad. 

One of the guests, a Halfling noble, leapt on to a table and yelled out “A Pestilence! A Plague! Run for your lives!”, and then turned towards Cassandra. The Halfling “noble” was none other than Percy Starkadder, the Scourge of Balder’s Gate. Percy gave Cassandra a smile and a thumbs up, before rushing after the crowd and locking the door behind them. He then bolted up the stairs to the balcony. 

A familiar voice was  whispering in Cassandra’s ear, “This way, dear. Let’s break that witch’s spell.” Cassandra turned, it was Etna, dressed in the vestments of a priest. She led Cassandra to the one remaining bridesmaid . . . Emmalite, the weasel bearer. 

Crumpet finally broke through the bridesmaids. Pointing his sword at Two-Penny he yelled “YOU!”.

Two-Penny smiled at him and replied mildly, “Who? Me? Crumpet, you great festering tit. Are you familiar with the term ‘Je Tuche’? Here, maybe this little song will help me explain…”

He then turned to the band, who was obviously in on the plan and said “What say you me lads? Play us a tune? Let us dance into battle, shall we?” 

At this, Two-Penny began beating out a cadence, striking sword to dagger as he stalked across the room. The band struck up a tune and Two-Penny began to sing:

""Je Tuche is old Elf for ‘I touch’""

""To a dumb fuck like you that don’t mean much""

""It means that I hit""

""You stupid git""

""It’s what I’ll say whenever I touch""

""Je Toche!""

On those final words, the air distorted and flowed from Two-Penny’s blade towards Crumpet. As the wave hit him, Crumpet recoiled in pain . . . Two-Penny’s spell had struck home.

As he reeled from the power of the spell, suddenly, Etna was upon him, a sword slash across the gut.

Emmalite took Cassandra by the arms, leaned forward and kissed her gently on the forehead. A shimmer, a spark, a very loud silence. And the spell was broken. Rage filled Cassandra’s eyes and Emmalite offered her a crossbow . . .

Two-Penny hadn’t missed a beat:

""It comes from the art of fencing""

""Where with swords not words we’d be mincing""

""So you’re shit out a luck""

""You stupid dumb fuck""

""‘Cause I’ve studied the art of fencing""

""Je Tuche!""

Again Crumpet fell back before Two-Penny’s spell. Before he could even begin to recover, two crossbow bolts drove into his chest. Cassandra smiled. Of her own accord this time.

Waving his sword wildly, trying to find space to recover, Crumpet backed against the tapestries covering the wall. Suddenly, a flaming arrow sank into the tapestry just above his head, setting it ablaze. The dry, ancient tapestry burst into flames, setting alight Crumpet’s cape. On the balcony, Percy let out a triumphant “High Ho!”, as he knocked a second arrow.

Screaming, Crumpet jumped forward to avoid the flames and right into Etna’s blade, she slashing his shoulder to the bone. In a flash, she was gone. 

Two-Penny jumped back on to the stage with the musicians, motioning for them to stop their tune. As they did:

""I prey to the gods who watch from on high""

""To please have mercy on this guy""

""Yes he’s real dumb""

""And he’s looking real glum""

""But the time has come for him to die . . .""

""Je Tuche!""

As the spell struck, blood began trickling out of Crumpet’s ears. But he stood defiant ready for the fight.

As another crossbow bolt buried itself in his groin, Cassandra’s golden laugh rang out through the hall as she began to reload.

Two-Penny leapt from the stage and charged forward towards Crumpet. Running his blade through his gut, he spun, flinging Crumpet off his sword and against the flaming wall. Before he could react, another of Percy’s arrows, struck him in the shoulder, followed quickly by a bolt from Cassandra’s crossbow.  By the time Crumpet had regained his footing, Two-Penny was across the room.

Staggering forward, Crumpet stumbled past the altar and turned to face Two-Penny and fell to his knees. Two-Penny’s smile was that of predator. “You might have bested me 15 years ago, you great spotty muldune, but I’ve learned a thing or two and you seem to have forgotten what little you knew. Say goodnight Crumpet . . .” and he started to charge . . . 

But, in a flash, there was a hooded figure, rushing from an alcove. A woman’s voice called out, “No! You can’t! You can’t kill him.”

The woman knelt beside Crumpet, and eased him to the floor with a loving touch. Cradling his head in her hands, she said “I won’t let you kill him . . .” Kissing him deeply, she plunged a dagger into his chest. Pulling back her hood, revealed a beautiful, older woman, beautiful red hair flowing like a river of sunlight. “That’s my job!”

Two-Penny stopped in mid stride, as if he’d been struck a mighty blow. “Siobhan . . .” his words were choked out just ahead of wail. “I had no idea you’d stayed with him.”

“My dear, sweet Rasputin. I had no choice. He said he’d kill you if I didn’t marry him. But Crumpet, that bastard, he got tired of me. And as I got older, just a few wrinkles, he tried to have me killed so he could marry her” she cried, pointing to Cassandra. “And he thought he’d succeeded, too. But I got away from the goons he’d sent to do the deed.” 

All this time,Percy had begun splashing lamp oil liberally around the room.

Two-Penny regained his composure and walked up to the dying man.

“It seems that years ago a die was cast . . .”

He rolled Crumpet’s writhing body over onto his stomach. 

“When I stole this sword, a spell was cast . . .”

He lifted Crumpet by the belt, hefting his buttocks into the air.

“But with on last hack, I’ll give it back . . .”

Thrusting the sword as he spoke the final words . . .

“Stuck right up your manky ass”

And Two-Penny let Crumpet fall. He turned to his friends, bowed deeply, and said in quiet voice “Je Toche.”

He turned to Siobhan, stroking her hair, looking deeply into her emerald eyes. “Bloody hell, you have gotten old. Fuck a bunch that. I’m out.” And he turned and strode towards the door. 

“Children…” he called out. And the urchins fell into line behind him. “What say you, we take our ill-gotten goods and drink ‘til we’ve gotten good and ill?” The urchins cheered. 

“Doomsdale . . .” and in a flash, his ""cat"" was sitting pretty on his shoulder. 

“And I can’t forget the band . . . gentlemen, I promised you 10 gold pounds. What would you say to 10 pounds o’ gold?” And he tossed them Crumpet’s purse. 

The band struck up a tune as they marched from the burning castle, Cassandra nibbling a carrot. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long ride from Water Deep to the Dales. But it was necessary. Shortly after saving the children from the Piper, wanted posters had started appearing all over town; wanted posters that obviously described Cassandra. The only thing that didn’t match was the white dress; Cassandra never wore white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be the changing Etna taking on Cassandra’s form so that she might more easily wreak havoc upon the land.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision was made that she had to get out of town. So she, Two-Penny, Emmalite, and Percy, set out on the Great West Road to Dagger Falls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly a month and a few bounty hunters later, they finally reached the Green Walls of Dagger Ford. The wanted posters had gradually decreased in frequency as the traveled until finally they hadn’t seen one in over a week. Time for a well-deserved rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a hot bath and hearty meal of fruits, vegetables, and a few too many potatoes (the Dalelanders were obsessed with potatoes), Cassandra was ready for her first night sleep in a bed in over a fortnight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. A deep, sweet repose full of dreams of music and sunlight, and better days. A perfect sleep. Until . . . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly rough hands were pinning her down. An acrid smell, unwashed bodies, tobacco, cheap beer, filled the room. Cassandra was able to let out one shrill scream before a cloth covered her nose and mouth and the room started to spin. The last thing she remembered was being roughly shoved into a bag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She came to some time later, gagged, blindfolded, and bound. She could tell she was in a wagon moving fast. But not her wagon. Her wagon was home. It smelled of flowers and sunshine.  This wagon stank of rotten meat, stale clothes, and filth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few hours, the wagon stopped. She could hear men’s voices, rough and crude, an accent not unlike Two-Penny’s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’s gots to feed the bitch. If’n she dies ‘for Crumpet gets his prize, there’ll be hell to pay,” one of them was saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll just take out the gag . . . she’ll swallow anything we put’s in her mouth!” the other replied. The both got a laugh out of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gag was removed, “Here lady, You’s got a keep up yer strength. Have some of this fine salted pork,” A lump of cold pork was shoved into her mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop it you!” she screamed, spitting it out, “I can’t eat meat!” Cassandra sobbed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fine. More there is fer us, then. At least have something to drink. Hold her mouth open, I’ll pour.” Strong, rough hands, took hold of her hair and chin and pried her mouth open. She could feel a bottle against her lips and a burning liquid poured into her throat. Then her mouth forced shut until she swallowed. The thugs repeated this several times, until the will to fight back drained out of Cassandra and she passed out drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They spent at least two days on the road like this, until they arrived at what turned out to be a large town. After a time on cobbled streets, every bump a knife in her sore back, they stopped and she was lifted out of the wagon and carried into a building. The smell of cooking food told her she was in a kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was laid out on a table, like a sacrificial feast, held fast at the wrists and ankles. The sound of boots on flagstone striding into the room filled her with dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, an elegant but cold man’s voice, “Good work my lads. You’ll be handsomely rewarded for this. Now, let us have a look at my bride-to-be . . .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blindfold was removed, the gag taken out. “Ah, she is quite the beauty. My dear, you have the honor of soon becoming Lady Crumpet,” he looked her up and down. Spread out on the table like this, with that leer in his eye, it was surprising he didn’t lick his lips. “You are allowed to show your pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra was barely able to speak, “Pleasure? I’d rather spit in your face, you loathsome troll!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His response was immediate, a hard backhand across the face. “I like a bit of defiance in my women. But I’ll soon tire of that then you’ll have to be broken just as one of my horses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the thugs, “Give her to the maids to get cleaned up . . . the wedding is at dusk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gag and blindfold were put back in place and a cloth again covered her nose. In just a few moments, Cassandra was unconscious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she woke, she was strapped to a chair in front of a dressing table, a large mirror before her. She had been bathed, her hair had been braided and coiled on her head in the shape of cone with a white tassel crowning it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her face had been powdered white, her checks rouged, her lips painted red. On most any other woman, this would have been beautiful. On Cassandra, it made a mockery of her wild, untamed splender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was dressed in what some women would say was a beautiful white gown. To Cassandra, it was uglier and more constraining than the leather straps binding her to the chair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As her head cleared, she began to take in her surroundings. She was in an elaborate dressing room, pink and frilly. Silver and lace adorned every surface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in the mirror, she saw Her . . . she saw the Witch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people wouldn’t have known she was a witch. But Cassandra knew. Her people knew witches . . . they were haunted by witches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the casual observer, she was a tall, lithe, elegant lady with a lordly bearing and a sophisticated air about her. But Cassandra saw through it all. To Cassandra, she was an aged, withered hag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah my dear. Within the hour, you shall become my daughter. I know you resist. And I know also that it is in vain. When my spell takes you, your will shall writhe and struggle and fight. But it will be of no use. Your body will do as it’s told. The more you fight it, the sweeter your surrender.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many would have missed her laugh was the cackle of a witch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She leaned in and whispered words into Cassandra’s ear, words that could only be heard but never remembered. Words that melted on the memory as snowflakes in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smile, my pretty,” she said when the spell was complete, “your wedding day is upon you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra fought not to smile but it was useless. She beamed into the mirror the most beautiful of smiles as the Witch removed the straps that held her down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come my dear, go to the altar and marry my son. The honeymoon bed awaits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra rose and followed her to the door, still smiling, a single tear running down her cheek. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she reached the door, the wedding march started to play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she approached the altar and lord Crumpet, five young women dressed in gaudy gowns, fell in step behind her. At the altar, he heard Crumpet, saying to the priest “Let us hurry this up, shall we? After this is consummated I have card game to get to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was like a nightmare that she couldn’t wake up from. It was happening so fast. All hope was lost . . . there was no way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dearly beloved,” droned the priest, “We have gathered here this evening to witness the joining of this couple in wedlock.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra’s eyes were pleading with the priest to stop but she knew it was to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, as the priest continued, he looked at Cassandra with a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes and he winked. Then blew a kiss to someone in the audience. A glimmer of hope shot through Cassandra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does anyone here tonight, have cause why these two should not marry?” asked the priest of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What, other than he being a complete bastard? I can’t think of thing.” It came from the stage, from one of the musicians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crumpet stammered and turned, obviously shocked that anyone would dare to do such a thing. When he saw who had dared, his eyes narrowed and he screamed “TWO-PENNY!!!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack “Two-Penny” Rasp stood defiantly on the stage, a broad and smug smile on his face. Handing his fiddle to one of the musicians, he jumped down to the ballroom floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Two-Penny! I’ll have your hide for boots you scamp!” Crumpet was apoplectic, frothing at the mouth, eyes bulging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, Two-Penny’s smile got broader. “Doomsdale?” he called out and from the ample bodice of one of the bridesmaids’ gowns, pop went the weasel. Doomsdale was flurry of furry fury. A terror to behold. First, in one of the women’s hair, then climbing up the leg of another. Biting, growing, hissing. She sent the bridesmaids into a shrieking panic, blocking the path between Two-Penny and Crumpet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Crumpet tried to force his way through them, Two-Penny called out again . . . “Oh children?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of the baker’s assistants, actually ruffian urchins hired by Two-Penny, knocked over the table holding the wedding cake. The cake wasn’t a normal cake. Magics cast by Emmalite had rotted it to the core. When it broke apart, a foul stench filled the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children then rushed into the guests, molesting them heartily . . . grabbing at anything that looked valuable . . . rings, necklaces, silverware, gold teeth. The crowd went mad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the guests, a Halfling noble, leapt on to a table and yelled out “A Pestilence! A Plague! Run for your lives!”, and then turned towards Cassandra. The Halfling “noble” was none other than Percy Starkadder, the Scourge of Balder’s Gate. Percy gave Cassandra a smile and a thumbs up, before rushing after the crowd and locking the door behind them. He then bolted up the stairs to the balcony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A familiar voice was  whispering in Cassandra’s ear, “This way, dear. Let’s break that witch’s spell.” Cassandra turned, it was Etna, dressed in the vestments of a priest. She led Cassandra to the one remaining bridesmaid . . . Emmalite, the weasel bearer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crumpet finally broke through the bridesmaids. Pointing his sword at Two-Penny he yelled “YOU!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-Penny smiled at him and replied mildly, “Who? Me? Crumpet, you great festering tit. Are you familiar with the term ‘Je Tuche’? Here, maybe this little song will help me explain…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then turned to the band, who was obviously in on the plan and said “What say you me lads? Play us a tune? Let us dance into battle, shall we?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this, Two-Penny began beating out a cadence, striking sword to dagger as he stalked across the room. The band struck up a tune and Two-Penny began to sing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Je Tuche is old Elf for ‘I touch’&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To a dumb fuck like you that don’t mean much&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It means that I hit&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You stupid git&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It’s what I’ll say whenever I touch&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Je Toche!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On those final words, the air distorted and flowed from Two-Penny’s blade towards Crumpet. As the wave hit him, Crumpet recoiled in pain . . . Two-Penny’s spell had struck home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he reeled from the power of the spell, suddenly, Etna was upon him, a sword slash across the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmalite took Cassandra by the arms, leaned forward and kissed her gently on the forehead. A shimmer, a spark, a very loud silence. And the spell was broken. Rage filled Cassandra’s eyes and Emmalite offered her a crossbow . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-Penny hadn’t missed a beat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It comes from the art of fencing&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where with swords not words we’d be mincing&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So you’re shit out a luck&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You stupid dumb fuck&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;‘Cause I’ve studied the art of fencing&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Je Tuche!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again Crumpet fell back before Two-Penny’s spell. Before he could even begin to recover, two crossbow bolts drove into his chest. Cassandra smiled. Of her own accord this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waving his sword wildly, trying to find space to recover, Crumpet backed against the tapestries covering the wall. Suddenly, a flaming arrow sank into the tapestry just above his head, setting it ablaze. The dry, ancient tapestry burst into flames, setting alight Crumpet’s cape. On the balcony, Percy let out a triumphant “High Ho!”, as he knocked a second arrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screaming, Crumpet jumped forward to avoid the flames and right into Etna’s blade, she slashing his shoulder to the bone. In a flash, she was gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-Penny jumped back on to the stage with the musicians, motioning for them to stop their tune. As they did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I prey to the gods who watch from on high&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To please have mercy on this guy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes he’s real dumb&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And he’s looking real glum&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But the time has come for him to die . . .&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Je Tuche!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the spell struck, blood began trickling out of Crumpet’s ears. But he stood defiant ready for the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another crossbow bolt buried itself in his groin, Cassandra’s golden laugh rang out through the hall as she began to reload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-Penny leapt from the stage and charged forward towards Crumpet. Running his blade through his gut, he spun, flinging Crumpet off his sword and against the flaming wall. Before he could react, another of Percy’s arrows, struck him in the shoulder, followed quickly by a bolt from Cassandra’s crossbow.  By the time Crumpet had regained his footing, Two-Penny was across the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staggering forward, Crumpet stumbled past the altar and turned to face Two-Penny and fell to his knees. Two-Penny’s smile was that of predator. “You might have bested me 15 years ago, you great spotty muldune, but I’ve learned a thing or two and you seem to have forgotten what little you knew.

&lt;p&gt;And Two-Penny let Crumpet fall. He turned to his friends, bowed deeply, and said in quiet voice “Je Toche.”&lt;/p&gt;

Hello fellow adventurers,

I'm looking for players and DMs of all kinds. People taking their first step forward, to ancient veterans. We're a D&amp;D server with multiple types of games as we like variety. Unfortunately, players and DMs alike tend to flake out at random times, so we prune regularly to remove inactive people. So we're all pretty active. Fun conversation and exciting revelry await for those who are interested. We're all from different time zones so people are always available around the clock. If this sounds like your kind of adventure, please click the link below. Please be communicative and serious players. I don't mind busy schedules, but at least give prior notice before leaving.

 Link to compressed version for easy preview: [Lost Temple of the Monkey King C](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1epkwnGZ_Ar8eG2B-u1V_3IdYJIszeDlL) 

It’s basically 3 digital maps, and a 19-page guide to a series of puzzles, traps, tricks and encounters that you could use within your own games to fill the space I provide. It’s only a bunch of suggestions and by no means do you have to use it, in fact I suggest you take a look and tailor it to your own needs. The guide is aimed at ‘Tier 1 play’ but it does tier into 3 levels of difficulty by using my CIA system.

**The guide also contains a new ‘creature’ and 2 new magic items (that can be used as a set).**

You can find my original VTT maps here: [Maps](https://www.deviantart.com/zatnikotel/gallery/68760870/Temple-of-the-Monkey-King)

**Please note that all of my stuff is completely free** (I don’t do Patreon, marketplace etc.), and a way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 35 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible). This map is not available on other sites and therefore contains only images of my own creation. All content is original.

I appreciate your feedback and I hope you enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi folks.

I now did a homebrew school in order to do said thing, and I'm posting it here for advices in order to make it more balanced, nerfing its aspects that might be too strong or buffing it if too weak.

I admittedly took a few features from existing classes, mixing them in a way that i think is thematic to what I'm trying to do.

So, here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

**School of the Flying sword**

The School of the Flying sword is a magical tradition that allows wizards to effectively control weapons - traditionally swords - with their minds, making them fly and using them to attack enemies.

More martial-minded than wizards of other schools, wizards of this arcane tradition are frequently found on the battlefields, often in the role of commanders, using their superior intellect to control the flow of the battle while fighting with their swords at a distance relatively safe.

&amp;#x200B;

*Flying sword:*

When you select this school at 2nd level, you learn a 1-hour ritual that bonds you to a single, one-handed melee weapon of your choice. You must be touching the weapon for the time of the whole ritual.

Once you have bonded the weapon, you gain proficiency with it and you can contol it with your mind, giving it the power to fly.

It constantly, effortlessly hovers next to you as long as you wish; when taking an attack action you can command it to attack a target in the range of 30 feet. After the attack, the weapon immediatly returns to you.

When you use your bound weapon to attack (both in melee and ranged) you add your intelligence modifier to the attack roll, but not to damage. If using it ranged you add no modifier to damage at all, and if using it in melee you add your strength or dexterity modifier to damage, as appropriate.

When you cast a  cantrip or a spell with a range of touch or that requires a melee spell attack or a melee attack, you can instead use your bound weapon to deliver it as part of the same action, effectively giving it a range of 30 feet. When you use your bound weapon in this way, you can't add the weapon damage to the damage of the spell, unless the spell or cantrip requires an attack with a weapon. 

Starting from level 12 you can bond with 2 light melee weapons or 1 two-handed melee weapon. If bonding with 2 light weapons you can control both with the same action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Spellsword:*

Starting at level 6, whenever you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one attack (either ranged or melee) with your bound weapon as a bonus action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Greater spellsword:*

Starting at level 10, whenever you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one attack (either ranged or melee) with your bound weapon as a bonus action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Keen mind, keen sword:*

Starting at level 14, whenever you use your bound weapon to attack or deliver a spell you add your intelligence modifier to the damage. This additional damage is of the same type of the weapon used and it's multiplied in case of a critical hit.

In case you're bound to 2 light weapons, the additional damage is applied only once per attack, not once per weapon. If the 2 weapons deal different types of damage, you can choose the additional damage to be of either type.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is it. I'll be grateful to anyone giving any advice.

Setup is a river flowing through a canyon (think the grand canyon) but with less room around the river/walkable areas.

&amp;#x200B;

The first one ended up being a really fun few minutes where the level 5 party very intelligently decides NOT to fight a zaratan and just let it do its thing. Quesion for yall- The paladin did cast BANE on it, since it had no 'harmful/noticable' affect I had the creature ignore it. Another PC swam along side it (30' away) and I had that ignored as well. That pc cast speak with animals, which I had not do anything since its a monstrosity, did I rule that correctly? In retrospect I think I should have let it work for RoC if nothing else.

&amp;#x200B;

Second one occurred when they tried to swim around a blockage of debris swept onto the trail from the river. The lizardfolk tied two players to himself and tried to swim them around, while 2 others tried to swim themselves and the last stayed on shore waiting for his turn on the 'taxi'

Obviously they now have to fight in the water... against a school of Quippers and 2 water elementals. This should be a DEADLY fight. (2 cr 5s plus the fish). Note I realized this was a little too hard so ignored the dmg resistance from teh MM.

The Sorceror instantly fireballs the school of quippers wiping them out, which makes her targeted by the elementals who like their fish pets! She goes unconscious fairly quickly but doesn't sink all the way to the bottom due to being tied to the wizard and the druid.

One elemental goes down fairly quickly after being concentrated on, and the other retreats after taking a ton of damage back down to the river bottom amid a large mass of seaweed.

THe paladin says... I Can hold my breath for 5 minutes IM GOING IN and dives down. Most of the rest of the group is fixated on getting the sorceror breathing again.

Unfortunately for the Paladin that mass of seaweed was a SEAWEED MONSTER (A Roper that was a PLANT and had Underwater Breathing). So he struggled for a bit before his friends realize he needed help. The Paladins OOC response- ***WTF its like NEMO and that thing he lives in!!!!!!!!!*** which is what I was going for so :P:P:P

Note during the fight I ruled anyone without a swim speed making an attack roll at disadvantage. Thoughts?

No PC deaths! Just 1 went unconscious :(

&amp;#x200B;

A bit later the path opens into a sinkhole the party needs to figure out how to scale the cliffface around ti (they are too scared to go into the water).

THe druid summons 2 giant chameleons and shifts into one. Everyone mounts up! The canyon has dense vegation growing across it somehow, blocked any view of the sky, so when the river splits into two the Chameleons grab vines and start crossing above the river to where they see a landing, light is dim so there's just some shadowy movement... they go for it!

Wizard casts GREASE on the landing hoping to trip up whatever is on it. Unfortunately the Barlgura makes its save after casting ENTANGLE on the party and leaps into the Vines giving off weird challenging HOOTs. INstantly the cleric of Pelor says... plants are flammable right? Me- Yup if you do enough dmg to em. Ok FIREBALL THAT FUCKER AND ALL TEH VINES HE's Hanging from.

The barlgura get's singed but makes his con save on the entangle and after falling 20' is able to grab the cliff behind him to not fall to the river below. He HOOT HOOTS angrily... and there is an answering HOOT HOOT from just out of sight range as another Barlgura ;Tarzans; his way in by violently swinging (i took their 'long jump' ability and applied it to swinging through vines to get into melee range quickly was a fun narrative). He immediately starts beating on the sorceror who firebolt cantrips the vines holding him but not enough to break the vine (i gave vines 10hp-she rolled way low for dmg)

The wizard is now panicking and says FUCK IT I""VE GOT A FIREBALL STILL and kabooms the second Barlgura who fails his save (because nothing was around I gave him Disadvantage on trying to find something to grab) and splashes into the river below after getting burned a bit.

Weird HOOTing is heard and splashing as the river carries it away. As they are debating whether or not to chase him down the river the HOOTs changed cadence and the Barlgura mysteriously disappeared. (these guys have Invis).They loot the Barlgura's cave and we end the night there.

So, RAW, critical ability checks just aren't a thing. A lot of people houserule that they are.

I like the idea of rewarding nat20s on ability checks, but I dislike the attitude that often accompanies allowing criticals on them, where players feel like a nat20 should just be an automatic success, regardless of their character's abilities and the context of the situation. Even if it doesn't lead to flat out arguing, it often leaves some ruffled feathers when a DM has to shut that down.

So here's my idea for players attempting the next-to-impossible.

When you roll a Nat20, you take 5 off the DC of the check. Thematically, some external force, magical or non, ""coincidentally"" helps in some way, shape, or form (a lucky break, so to speak).

DCs go as high as 40, to signify the absolute most implausible attempts. (At DC40, the check would drop to DC35, allowing only someone with at least +5 Prof, expertise, and +4-5 in the related stat to succeed.)

The real goal, however, is to have checks over DC25 to be outright impossible for a character with a negative modifier in that ability. (Since it doesn't seem to be clear, this would allow any character that *does* have *literally any talent* in that skill to pass this check on the 20. A lot of character's would pass not even on crits. But it would still let a character who isn't good at doing that roll if they really want to without the chance for their character to do something it shouldn't really be able to do, while allowing the characters that can to do so.)

How do you feel about this?

Edit: People don't seem to like it very much. I will be asking DMAcademy simply for ""Ways to make Nat20 ability checks exciting"", or something of the like.

Everyone is way too focused on me saying that this would make certain rolls impossible for a player, when that would generally mean it would make a roll that was otherwise impossible for 3/4 of the party to only be impossible for 1/2 the party instead, without allowing anyone and their grandmother to crit check success something.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy all, just looking for opinions on this.&lt;/p&gt;

* I threw in some random abilities and proficiencies for the example.
* I had to be vague with the descriptions in order to serve as many basic classes as I could.
* Not everything from the original character sheet is included, just the items that are most urgent when playing to help keep the flow going.

I thought of making a good-aligned Conquest paladin without breaking the tenets; by improving (changing) the concept.

**Douse the Flame of Hope**: even though my paladin is not made for redemption, I still like to give enemies their second chances (pretty much surrendering) by asking of their surrendering motives (but I think /u/Souperplex 's idea of using Zone of Truth is a more viable action; insight is good, too); because I think denying or breaking second chances are more regrettable than the first ones. So once they did deny or break them, the last thing they see is my warhammer in their faces.

**Rule with an Iron Fist**: I think of this as ""controlling"" your enemies (aside from casting command) through instilling fear on them; and by being frightened, your party can have advantage on battle, as others are minding their own business by cowering. Or it can be that you dominated or killed their leader and you used it as an example to them not to try to defy you.

**Strength Above All**: I was confused at first, but then I watched How To Train Your Dragon and heard Drago said ""So, he who controls the alpha, controls them all."" So, I thought overpowering the leader, or killing them, might not be so bad for the iron fist part. Controlling the leader by casting command (thinking about using it on battle to command their minions is confusing; one day they told them to kill, the next they told them to hug) is one thing; killing them is another thing, in which you can actually douse their flames out.

The trait allows them to change into any beast or humanoid of CR equal to or less than their own.

&amp;#x200B;

Change Shape. The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl's choice).

In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.

&amp;#x200B;

The ability seems fairly straightforward when looking at beasts, but when changing into humanoids little is explained. The description states that class features aren't gained from the new form but doesn't clarify what class features are. In the Monster Manual spellcasting is called out as ""the Spellcasting class feature"" making a fairly solid case to remove spellcasting from any humanoid stat block and I'd be inclined to remove anything that shares a name with a class ability like cunning action and sneak attack, but beyond that I'm lost.

&amp;#x200B;

A bear has proficiency in perception because of it's physical form but a spy's proficiency in deception is a learned skill. Would you treat these the same?

&amp;#x200B;

Would multiattck be considered a class feature due to it's similarities to extra attack?

&amp;#x200B;

Is gear part of a humanoid? Because you're a Knight does that mean you now have plate and a greatsword?

&amp;#x200B;

Would something like a lycanthrope or a deep scion even be considered humanoid for the sake of this ability?

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would something like a lycanthrope or a deep scion even be considered humanoid for the sake of this ability?&lt;/p&gt;

My Dragonborn Cleric it's a cleric for the last one the Dragonborn God's. All of the ancentrian celestial dragon fight in the last Celestial war and won.

But they lost so much power, that they lost their mayor influence in the mortal plane.

Not long afterwards, the Dragonborns forgot them and just keep fighting and moving away from them.

So ALL celestial Dragonborn ancestrals are desesperated to win some more power or they will disappear.

My Cleric just found out one of the last relic's of them, and contact them, get giving him a mission, one thousand normal souls praying for them or one real big long maybe enough.

But he needs to bring back dead tradition's and basically re-construct an entire church.

So we are playing Mines of Phandelver and they are currently inside Cragmaw Castle. They entered the castle using the side door without alerting anyone and entered area 12 from area 11. Inside they found 2 hobgoblins and combat errupted. Since players retreated instead of trying to deal with them quickly and the way to the kings room was blocked by the players, the hobgoblins ran to warn the others of the intruders. I gave the players 4 rounds to prepare and they blocked some doors they hadn't explore yet and prepared for battle against almost all forced of the castle.

&amp;#x200B;

So the Druid in bear shape protected the upper side of area 12 and the rest were in the room with the beds. As they were fighting they start to hear something trying to open the door from area 14 (the kings room they blocked with some furniture) because of all the noise from the fighting. As the fight drags on, the druid looses all HP from the bear and retreats to where the other players are and the hobgoblins finally open the door to the king.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, there is only 3 hobgoblins alive and 1 goblin, the king and it's pet and the doppleganger. At this point they hear the King tell them to surrender or the dwarfs dies. The players abide and are escorted into area 14 and asked to surrender their weapons or  Gundren Rockseeker dies. After some negociating they decide to drop their weapons and the seassion ends.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think the next reasonable thing for the king to do? One thing I'm thinking of doing is put some shackles on them and have droop come help them (yea they have been with droop all this time but he was too afraid to enter the castle) since they have been very good to him, but any ideas are welcome !! 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a little background of one of the reasons they decided to drop weapons. In session 0 I asked players to tell me a story  of how they met  Gundren Rockseeker and 2-3 little storied of how the dwarf helped them. This was to create some connections with the players and the dwarf.

I've been DMing for a few years now and my current campaign for nearly a year. I'm really happy with how it's going and everyone is having fun, but I think not as much as they could be.

But my players never talk about their characters lives or ambitions or anything with the other players or NPCs.

It's not like I don't give them the chance, just the other day they had about a week of down time and I asked everyone what their character wanted to do for the next few days and you could have heard a pin drop. Another time, the party was performing a raise dead ritual on a party member (I have some house rules for this where players can contribute to the ritual making it more likely to work properly if they do something meaningful to convince the dead characters soul to return). Problem is, nobody talks about their characters story or personality, so besides what that character can do in combat, they knew almost nothing about his life even though they've been traveling together for a while.

Currently we have 6 party members, but I'm not sure if our Wizard is just joining us for this particular adventure of the **Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan**, or if he's here to stay.

&amp;nbsp;

The Party consists of:

**My Lore Bard** who is mainly full support, and as a characteristic would rather persuade people with his charm, instead of deceit or intimidate them.

Cantrips: *Vicious Mockery*, *Mage Hand*, *Minor Illusion*

1st lvl Spells: *Healing Word*, *Faerie Fire*, *Dissonant Whispers*, *Bane*, and *Thunderwave* (in case enemies get close)

2nd lvl spells: *Heat Metal*, *Shatter*

3rd lvl Spell: *Hypnotic Pattern*

&amp;nbsp;


**Moon Druid**: Who sometimes plays tank, and other times plays support. Also has *Healing Word* and *Healing Spirit* (might only be allowed during combat or can target one person outside of combat).

**Champion Fighter** Who has been really bad at rolling, and has only done her critical 3 or 4 times at most.

**Hunter Ranger** Who has *Two-Weapon Fighting* and *Colosus Slayer*. Also has *Cure Wounds* to heal, and *Ensnaring Strike* for crowd control suport, when needed. But is also notoriously bad roller.

**Assasin Rogue** Who tends to be our main damage dealer due to bad rolls from other players.

**Wizard** Which is still unknown if he will stick around after this dungeon.


&amp;nbsp;


My problem comes with the upcoming *Additional Magical Secrets* and what to pick with it.

For my character I think that I've narrowed it down to 3 spells, which are:

**Bless**, to further aid my teammates. It will also help me to amplify multiple allies instead of just one, since I've been using most of my *Bardic Inspiration* on the Ranger and Fighter, to make up for their bad rolls.

**Spiritual Weapon** Which will allow me to attack as a bonus action in those times when my *Concentration* is already being used and there is no need to use or have run out of Bardic Inspiration. Currently I have *Thunderwave*, *Vicious Mockery*, and *Shatter* as my only spells that don't require concentration or a bonus action.

**Counterspell** I've heard people talk about it a lot, and how the Lore Bard is the best counter-speller of all classes, and it's one of those spells that you probably will rarely use, but you'll be glad that you have, when you do.


&amp;nbsp;


I mainly use *Bardic Inspiration* rather than *Cutting Words*, because my DM seems to look down on *Cutting Words* and still isn't quite clear on the times that I can use it. I don't argue it, and besides, *Bardic Inspiration* seems more of my character's trait than *Cutting Words*, and has proven to be a lot more useful on my allies.

Although he does play musical instruments, my character is less of a typical bard, but more of a devoted scholar and explorer with a lot of charm (Think Jean-Luc Picard mixed with Indiana Jones). He has become a master of words, and through his studies has learned to weave and manipulate sound waves in a manner that can alter emotions or even bend light. As a player (not as my character), I even bring a small leather bound looking journal and am the one that is always taking down notes and drawing doodles of our adventures, for the party and seemingly stuck to my book. I'm hoping that by the end of our game, which will be a little past lvl 10, I will have filled the journal with notes and doodles for the players to be able to see.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My party is currently at level 5 and I&amp;#39;m trying to plan my next level to help mend some rough edges in our group. 3 of the players, including myself, were new to D&amp;amp;D (when we started at level 1), and this is everyone&amp;#39;s first go at 5th Edition.&lt;/p&gt;

My first pg was a dwarf paladin, didn't really know how to play so he died pretty quickly. Now with some more experience with me i'm trying to create a new pg, and i have to try the barbarian class. I'm not really sure about the race though. with the d6 i rolled i got pretty high stats, and by adjusting them (my DM lets us get a -2 in a stat to get a +1 in another stat) i have to chose between:

* HALF-ORC: STR 20; DEX 15; COST 20; INT 10; WIS 15; CHA13
* HUMAN: STR 20; DEX 16; COST 20; INT 11; WIS 14; CHA 14

If i look at stats only i think human is the right choice, i will have 18 AC (Half orc 17AC) with same HP (17), +3 initiative (+2 half-orc). 

If i look at proficiencies and abilities i lose so much by switching to human that i don't know if it's worth it (i would lose proficiency in INTIMIDATION, Relentless endurance, Savage Attack)

I have a bard band serving an evil person. The person is going to monologue and then cue the band. I will describe the band as the intro to Thunderstruck plays. Then on the bands turn I will play some of the song, describing the power growth as they play. On the words ""Thunderstruck"" I want the spell to do something. 

I want the spell to go off each time the word ""Thunderstruck"" is said. 

I am not sure what the spell should do though. It needs to be impressive enough that 3-5 high level bards are casting it instead of their own spell.

I've been looking everywhere for something to fill exactly what I was looking for. I wanted adventures, articles, monsters, traps and a whole grab bag of fun stuff. And I wanted something physical, but also something that I'd enjoy even if I didn't end up running the adventure. I've found it in the monthly ""Comic Book"" [Rolled &amp; Told](https://www.rolledandtold.com/). It can be bought or ordered from most friendly neighborhood comic shops.

&amp;#x200B;

It's so perfect and I haven't seen anyone talking about it on reddit so I wanted to advocate for it. If you scroll down to the bottom of this post I've attached an album of photos from the two books I just picked up.

&amp;#x200B;

The book is monthly and each contains a big adventure. I've read two of them and they're exactly the kind of adventure I'm looking for. I'm pretty particular, and I like lots of roleplay but also lots of mechanics and the kind of fun stuff that I'm too lazy to build myself like maps and complex traps/dungeons. The stories are unique and super fun.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a lot of other stuff in the book, which you'll see in the attached album. Beautiful art and maps. A few pages of comic spread throughout that is based on the included adventures or articles. There are articles about homebrew, or DM advice. Roll tables, Monsters, NPCs. And a mini adventure that isn't as big as the Main adventure at the beginning of the book. Plus it seems like there are other things that can be included. One of my books contains a super cool custom character sheet with a crystal ball and all sorts of interesting imagery.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this for $7.99. I really don't want to fall in love with this book so much and have it be unsuccessful, so I've made this post hoping I can give it some attention. Plus I'm hoping to start some discussion with anyone who may have heard of it already, but I'm expecting most people haven't.

My question for y'all is how to progress. I would like to get to HW level 11 for Distant Strike and the increase damage on Planar warrior, but but there is a choice between delaying Cleric levels or not happening until very late. I also know that not all campaigns go to level 20, so I want to get the most out of each level without waiting for level x to come ""online"". I don't think I have to worry too much about that but it's always a concern with multiclassing.

Below is a rough idea on what I imagined a decent progression is:


Level | Class | Class Level
---|---|----
1-5 | Ranger | 1-5
6, 7 | Cleric | 1, 2
8-10 | Ranger | 6-8
11,12 | Cleric | 3, 4
13-15 | Ranger | 9-11
16-19 | Cleric | 5-8
20 | Ranger | 12

Updates for v1.1

1. Changed name from Speaker to Soulspeaker because it’s cooler.

2. Changed from a Charisma Half-Caster to a Wisdom Half-Caster.

3. Cleaned up the wording of the Shaping feature, and now shaped objects can be anchored to a nearby surface.

4. Added two unique Fighting Styles: Affection and Empathy.

5. Changed their spellcasting focus from a druidic focus to a simple or martial weapon or shield that they are proficient with.

6. Joining now lasts for 10 minutes, to give it more use as a limited ability to find invisible or hidden creatures.

8. Aggression’s Weapon Shaping now prevents you from being disarmed of a joined weapon weapon or shield.

9. Patience’s Delicate Shaping has been changed to Sturdy Shaping, and the tools or vehicles created now last until you use your Shaping again.

11. Added the spell Tiny Servant to the Soulspeaker’s spell list.

12. Weapon Betrayal now costs an action to cast and adds your Wisdom modifier to damage rolls made with the weapon.

So many good things to say about it. After several games and looking at many 1-20 builds, I had a few thoughts on what I'd do to improve it. I'd be curious to hear from others too.

I'll stick to what I want to see most; for the spell-storing to be a bit more of a core mechanic. Something that is present from lower-mid levels to the very end. Here's how I'd do it:

# 1) Move Spell-storing to lvl 7 but only allow it for lvl 1 spells

**Reasoning:** Levels 7-11 are fairly slow. Magic weapons, wands, and potions of health are starting to become fairly easy to come by, so the benefit you bring to the group by offering access to those things is waning. In combat, you've either been running arcane weapon since lvl 1 OR using cantrips and a few spells (on very limited slots).

# 2) Add 'Improved Spell-storing' at lvl 11 to allow lvl 2 spells

**Reasoning:** This was a cool ability. Very defining, very versatile. But it doesn't seem to me to stack up with what other classes can do at lvl 18. I also wouldn't want to wait until the game is almost over to get to try it out with all the fun lvl 2 spells (enlarge, levitate, etc). Lvl 11 feels right to me.

# 3) Add a 'Master Work' sub-class ability at lvl 18.

**Reasoning:** I see the Artificer as a half-caster that leans more towards the casting-side of things (while paladins and rangers, lean more towards the martial side of things). By level 18, your paladins are smiting for numbers that make your head hurt and giving there auras to everyone in 30'. Your casters are dropping 9th level spells. And rangers... erm... well... nevermind them.

At this level, it's ok for classes to occasionally break the game a bit.

My idea is to give the Alchemist something similar to magical secrets. It has a few limitations though; (1) you can only have one spell, (2) it has to be of a certain school of magic depending on your subclass, and (3) it has to be an 8th level spell or lower. However, similar to spell-storing, you can give the item to a party member and allow *them* to cast it.

**Design (for alchemist):** ""After honing your specialization for years, you're ready to create a master work that is truly unique. You are inspired to create an object capable of replicating the effects of one transmutation or necromancy spell of 8th level or lower.

Select a spell of either school from any class spell list. Once per day, your invention may be used to cast the chosen spell as if it were cast using an 8th level slot. Aside from the spell slot consumption, the casting has all the same requirements and limitations as the original spell to cast. Once cast, the object cannot be used again until after a long rest.

These objects require a bit of maintenance every morning by the artificer who created it to remain in working condition. If it is broken or stolen, you remember everything needed to recreate it. However, only one object can exist in working condition at any time.""

I've never DMed a full game before, just a session or two years ago. I'm looking for advice as a new DM and advice on running this particular module.

The only specific questions I have are:

What are the players and their characters supposed to know ahead of time? Is there a specific section for that in the book? Anything that is meant to be read to them to give them stuff to base their characters on? I don't think any of them know anything about Waterdeep.

I'm going to be running the game with 5, probably 6 and maybe occasionally 7 players. Will the encounters work as is like this? I figure I'll let the first 3 or so levels play out and then adjust the encounters up a bit if it seems like things are too easy.

Other than that, I'll take any hints or suggestions that people have.

My name's Jeph and I run a yearly RPG livestream charity called [JephCon](http://www.jephcon.org). We've raised money for various suicide prevention and mental health organizations in the past, most notably the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in memory of my younger brother who lost his battle with depression back in 2012. 

This year we're raising money for To Write Love On Her Arms, a suicide prevention and self-harm reduction charity. They do a lot of amazing work and I'm thrilled to be working with them. 

This is our third year, having raised $3350 (2017) and $3860 (2018) in previous years. We're aiming to blow past both of those totals this year, but we need your help. 

This year we'll be playing:

* D&amp;D 5th Edition (""The Fantastic Five"" and ""We're Not Critical Role"")
* Star Wars: Edge of the Empire (""Let's Steal a Star Destroyer"")
* Pathfinder 2E (""Go For The Gold"")
* A D&amp;D 4th Edition Battle Royale

The full schedule (and Donate link) can be found at [JephCon.org](http://www.jephcon.org) and a list of raffle prizes is available at [prizes.JephCon.org](http://prizes.jephcon.org).

If you feel like watching a bunch of folks play tabletop games, swing by. We'll be active from 12:00 ET to 22:00 ET on Saturday and Sunday (March 30th and 31st, 2018).

(Gore-related descriptions ahead)

Prerequisites to know:
1. The PC’s don’t know each other yet.
2. Players may die at the beginning, though it isn’t designed for them to.
3. This will take place in a homebrew world.
4. Scenario CR may be Hard to Deadly.

So, I start with some ominous, ambient music, wait a moment, then say “[PC Name], [PC Name], PC Name]... I want you all to make a DC 14 Constitution Saving Throw.”

Upon a success, PC’s resist a paralyzing/sleeping poison they were subjected to and wake up to one of their legs or arms in the process of being sawed off (narrative describing the sound and their vision fades in and they regain feeling) on a wooden table by a cult member while they are tied down by rope. There are other tables with the other party members on them, who are all in the process of being sawed into.

Those who don’t wake might lose a limb if the ones that did wake can’t untie/break themselves free and save the others. Though each sleeping PC makes a waking Con Save for every limb the cultists get to (a chance to save each limb).

If they all wake, great! They can fight a bunch of cultists and try to escape. Otherwise, their body parts are going to be used to resurrect and piece together some sort of ancient fiend/devil-like necrotic entity (evil, previously dead deity maybe?). If they lose a limb, they have to make another constitution saving throw to not pass out. If everyone passes out, they’ll wake again later without the 1 limb and will be in separate wooden cages in a room together. Awaiting the next round/next part of the ritual (lest they escape their cages).

If they end up fighting and losing to the cult members, I’ll have the cult stabilize them and put them in the cages again. Perhaps poisoned with paralysis/sleep poison again, requiring more Constitution saves or Strength rolls if they don’t completely resist the poison (partial paralysis). Maybe I’ll add levels of exhaustion as they lose each limb/pass out.

I’ll have a series of pass out&gt;Constitution Save&gt;wake up and cult progress scenarios in case they end up not being able to escape repeatedly. If this happens enough (by possibly semi-rare chance) then eventually they won’t have any limbs, but will still be alive (the cult wants them alive for the ritual).

Also, if they escape without killing, destroying or completely foiling the plans of the cult then I’ll have the cult end up resurrecting their Fiendish entity (later on using other people’s bodies perhaps) and have that play out later in the campaign.

As you can tell, I really prefer the hard intro. Though for this, I’ll let them know that they might all die at the very beginning or become permanently debilitated, though won’t give them any details or hints as to what awaits them. I plan to allow ways for them to compensate for their potential limb loss going forward (ex. Magic legs, peglegs, etc.,). Though I won’t make it obvious or immediate. I’ll just know what options they have at their current levels if they pursue and inquire about them in-game.

- What thoughts, ideas and feedback do you guys have on pursuing this intro?
- What do you think about running this for newcomers vs experienced players?

**EDIT**: Perhaps there’s a lack in my description of this idea, though as railroaded as it sounds, I do plan to provide plenty of agency being available for the player, and will be heavily role play dependent as to the outcome.

**EDIT**: As it seems there are a lot of people absolutely opposed to the possibility of being dismembered, I ask this. If the possibility of not only prosthetics was available, but upgradeable, weaponizable and eventually (level dependent) magic enhanced prosthetic armaments were available to compensate for such a loss, how would you guys feel about that in this scenario?**

**EDIT**: Perhaps I’ll do One-Shots with each person individually before this session with their characters, and I could have them battle a higher level cultist at the end of their One-Shot as they are leaving. Fast forward to the start of the aforementioned intro, and everyone has been captured, tied and is about to be cut up into bits.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about running a new campaign and I really love to basically traumatize my PC’s at the start to really set the intensity level of the campaign.

But their biggest weakness, IMO,  is their absolute lack of self-buff combat spells. Haste, Shadow Blade, Enlarge/Reduce, Shield, Absorb Elements, Mirror Image, Blur, Magic Weapon and the like are all absent from their spell list. Greater Invibility seems like their first real self-buff and that comes in at level 7.

My first thought is that a level of Hexblade helps in getting shield proficiency, Armor of Agathys and Shield as well as all the usual Hexblade goodies including SCAG cantrips.

But of course, Blade Flourishes are incompatible with SCAG cantrips, otherwise Booming Blade and Mobile Flourish would actually be useful.

I’m thinking that Glamour might actually be better as a melee gish.

Glamour could get that Hexblade dip for Booming Blade, then go BB-&gt;bonus action Command: Flee, then use Warcaster to get another bonus action BB in. This would net (2d8+4+2d8)*2 = 44 avg damage without spending any resources and taking an enemy out of the fight for a turn.

This version would probably be concentrating on Bane.

The PAM Swords Bard/Hexblade could do 2d6+10+1d4+5 = 24,5 avg damage. Using flourishes could boost that by 13,5 but that’s it before the next short rest. I don’t know what spell they’d be concentrating on, maybe Hex? That would close the damage gap. That leaves them without Armor of Agathys though.

You could also go Whispers Bard with CBE and do 2d6+6+6d6=34 avg damage and use only two inspiration dice.

I know, they’re supposed to be caster first, melee fighter distant second, but I just wish they were, you know, even kinda good at melee.

Edit: I’m more trying to get suggestions on how to play and build Swords Bard as a gish rather than bashing the Bard as a class. As a class it’s super nice, I just feel like Swords Bard is lacking in tools that make gishes great.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really want to do a boastful, flamboyant braggard-type caster-fighter who is actually pretty good at fighting, and the Swords Bard with their high Charisma and melee skills kinda pops out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But their biggest weakness, IMO,  is their absolute lack of self-buff combat spells. Haste, Shadow Blade, Enlarge/Reduce, Shield, Absorb Elements, Mirror Image, Blur, Magic Weapon and the like are all absent from their spell list. Greater Invibility seems like their first real self-buff and that comes in at level 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought is that a level of Hexblade helps in getting shield proficiency, Armor of Agathys and Shield as well as all the usual Hexblade goodies including SCAG cantrips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, Blade Flourishes are incompatible with SCAG cantrips, otherwise Booming Blade and Mobile Flourish would actually be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking that Glamour might actually be better as a melee gish.&lt;/p&gt;

And I see it crop up often whenever people are talking about games they've been in. For those unaware, Critical Success and Critical Failures are the rules that a 1 is an auto-fail with usually extra bad consequences, and a 20 is a auto-success with usually extraordinarily good consequences.

I myself feel that these rules themselves are not bad. In fact I believe they give a bit of extra depth to the system. A bad guy, no matter how powerful, has the potential to miss the party or fail their impossible to fail save. While the good guys always have a shot, even a slim one, to land a hit on an enemy no matter how impossible. This itself means that players are always encouraged to try. Players are encouraged to not give up, and just quit the encounter. And those moments when a last ditch effort pays off is usually extremely memorable. Additionally, they can add a lot of fun into an rping event, especially in social circumstances. The bard trying to swoon some ladies in a tavern and rolling a natural 1 is amusing and usually worth a good laugh in the night. Which imo, is one of the most important elements in a collaborative-story-based-game like this, to have people have fun.

However, the flip side with this is that there are no established 5th edition tables for fails. Many of the charts in circulation right now are ones that are ones adopted by older editions, where the DM was encouraged to combat the players more often, and with a greater voracity. This means the Critical Fumble Tables used are moreso based on older mechanics, and do not have easy solutions in this edition. 

But more important than this, is I think people take Critical Success and Critical Failure, and give them far too much weight in how they impact a story. Getting a 20 and hitting an enemy, and describing it as a lucky strike that by the sheer grace of the gods, hits at the monster dead center of its blind spot, is fine. Getting a 20 in a skill check and describing how the PC seems to show an almost supernatural knack for this thing, is also fine. Likewise describing how a Natural 1 hits the monster, but at a bad angle and thus bounces off the monster tough hide. Or a natural 1 in which a person trying to woe a suitor ends up with a glass of water splashed in their face, are all fine.

Because the consequences aren't that big. Many dm's tend to make the effects of a critical success or failure too big. An enemy critically fumbling auto-kills one of its allies, dramatically shifting the fight. Likewise a player who rolls a nat 1 can drop their weapon at best, making them waste a round picking it back up. Or to some highly debilitating injuries such as Losing a Limb, dropping to 0 hp, killing a comrade, etc. Some people even turn Critical Successes into failures for fun, like a person getting a Natural 20 stealth roll ""Can't find their own character lul"". While okay in a situation where there isn't danger of characters dying, some Dm's do this kind of thing in very serious, life or death scenarios, and it really detriments the games and the players enjoyment. 

IMO, there's a case to be made for both sides.

&lt;p&gt;IMO, there&amp;#39;s a case to be made for both sides. And Im curious to see where you fall within this debate.&lt;/p&gt;

9th | destructive wave, control winds

I especially like the addition of Thunder Step, as it's painfully thematic for the tanky, combat mage role the Tempest Cleric is built for.

I've had a lot of fun with Storm Sphere, though it really just acts like an improved version of Call Lightning. Which is fun, but I wonder if there are better options.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on an original campaign setting book, and would greatly appreciate your feedback. I'm looking to accomplish 3 things:

1. Provide an incredible amount of resources and ideas to help someone bridge the gap between Adventure Module DM and Homebrew DM (Maps, tables, story hooks, factions, NPC's, etc.)
2. Share my diverse setting which incorporates a large variety of themes and play styles (trad fantasy, low magic, high magic, urban, military, steampunk, gothic, etc.), complete with a framework and general tips on how to bounce between them to keep the campaign fresh and increase player agency
3. Create a solid, high value product that people genuinely enjoy and helps them on their D&amp;D journey. Will be launching a kickstarter at some point, with flex goals including additional adventure modules, minis, dungeon tiles, and who knows what else lol

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your thoughts and feedback! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is this something you would buy? What would you like to see in a resource like this that would make it a worthwhile addition?
2. Art will be cruical to this project, what would draw you in more: A consistent style throughout or a different artist/approach to each province? Would commissioning more recognized fantasy artists in the community ie. Bob Kehl or taking a more crowd-sourced community submission process be more appealing to you?
3. What kickstarter flex goals or ideas would you like to see? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading!  My 5e group and I have had a blast with our campaign over the last 2 years in the setting, and although I still constantly struggle with impostor syndrome about most things I create, with the urging and support of my players behind me I'm putting myself out there.

The party is 6 level 14s - Light Cleric, Swords Bard, Ancestral Barbarian, Rogue, Fighter, and Wizard.  They haven't rested in a while and are pretty low on spell slots, but I don't know their exact numbers.

The Cleric succeeded on a Divine intervention and temporarily became the avatar of his god, with the following effects:

**Avatar Benefits:**

-Fully recovered HP and spell slots

-Proficiency bonus goes to 6

-20th level caster with full spell slot schedule

-can casts spells at 3rd level and below without expending spell slots

-no limit on uses of Warding Flare or Channel Divinity

-can ignore all material components of spells

-have every spell on the cleric list prepared

-gain a 60 ft fly speed

-gain 50 temporary HP when the effect starts

**Downsides:**

-every 60 seconds and when the effect starts, gain 1 level of hollowing (homebrew rule, means he dies at the 2 minute mark if it's not over by then)

-after avatar state ends, DC 20 Con save against 5 levels of exhaustion (3 on a success)

The Cleric is about to fight the BBEG, a 20th level wizard with pretty standard wizard spells.  The BBEG also has 3 legendary actions to use on: Cantrip, Melee Attack, Spell (Costs 2), and Teleport (60ft).  He has lair actions that the Cleric doesn't know about, and hes a 60ft fly speed.

In order for your party to gain surprise on a group of enemies, all of your party members must remain undetected (usually by stealth) up to the point where you initiate combat. If any party member is detected before you attack, surprise is lost. [At least that's my impression from the last point of this sage advice.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/05/17/suppose-i-hide-in-combat-and-im-not-found/).

&amp;#x200B;

NO Multiclassing allowed.

I would like to look at an approach to make a 5th ed character.

&amp;#x200B;

I must admit I do like the look of an Arcaane Archer. (However I 

can only use three books to create the character) 

which alas does NOT contain Xanathars.

&amp;#x200B;

I have at our disposal 

&amp;#x200B;

PHB

Evil Elemental

Tal'Dorei

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All I know at the moment in regards to what I'm seeing in my head is 

an older grumpy man.  Possibly a Bounty hunter, Ranger or just plain 

fighter class. 

&amp;#x200B;

Armed with some form of archery/crossbow.

Two hand axes or large axe (similar to a Viking axe in style)

The axes could be dual wielded or have axe and shield, can be thrown of course.  Add one large Bowie knife.

&amp;#x200B;

Unsure on spellcaster, unsure on pure fighter class, but definite that he can handle himself in battle/fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Options below please including 

&amp;#x200B;

Stat options, top three chosen.

Possible Race

Possible Class (open to anything that is a single class).

Possible feats and when to take them if applicable would be handy.

So could be magic, might not be magic.  Just got this old man in head sitting around the campfire being grumpy.

Why you ask? Because I'm the only one in my current group that's played before, and a lot of them were having trouble with combat so I figured I'd make the encounters a little easier.

And as a ranged battlemaster fighter, it's worked splendidly. I didn't know how much damage I *wasn't doing* in my other characters until I played this fighter. And don't get me wrong, I love being awesome in combat. But, out of combat, there's just not much I can do.

In our current game, I've recently founded an adventuring guild after a few heroic quests accompanied by my party. We're the founding members, and years later, our little guild has grown. Before I made this character, I purposefully dumped a lot of points into CHA and took persuasion as a skill because I wanted to be a leader of sorts. It's been nice, but I just feel like I'm missing something roleplay-wise.

So I took a look at the bard. I've never played in 5E before, and I have to say, the features and spells all look a lot of fun. Bardic inspiration fits my leader role perfectly and gives me something to do with bonus actions, illusion cantrips help me give off resounding speeches and tell harrowing tales, buff and debuff spells both look like a lot of fun and can be pretty helpful during combat.

We're about to hit Level 6, and at that point, I was originally just gonna go fighter again--maxing about my dex, which as a human fighter with sharpshooter would be ideal. But I feel like this is the high point of a fighter, the next big advantage really doesn't happen till 11, which is a looong way off. On the other hand, if I start taking bard, I'll still be a beast in combat and have some support features and a ton of out-of-combat roleplay to boot.

Thoughts?

TL;DR: Level 5 fighter/guild leader with high CHA thinking of going bard for a few levels for fun and flavor.

Proteusus

Transfiguration cantrip.

Requirements: S, M (1 gold piece if using the secondary function)

Cast Time: 1 Action

Duration: 1 minute

You may add decorative detail to a crafted item, carving runes, images, symbols, or crests into the item. The item must be no larger than a 5 foot cube, and the relief is only deep enough for the carved image to be visible. The carvings are permanent unless the Mending Cantrip is used on them to remove them.

In addition, you may spend one action using 1 Gold piece worth of materials to make a small mechanical device that you choose from the options below. The device is non-magical, though magic does power it, and ceases function after one minute. If the device’s function is not used before the duration ends, it loses its function and becomes mundane. 
•	Clockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or Soldier. This Toy can move 5 ft. on your turn for 1d4 rounds, moving in a random direction. Afterwards, it becomes inanimate, but maintains its shape.

•	Fire Starter: The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a Candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

•	Music Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end, when it is closed, or when the duration has completed.

•	Scribing Quill: This small quill automatically transcribes your words onto a piece of parchment, needing no ink or hand to control it. It knows the languages you know, and can only hear the voice of its creator. If the quill runs out of space to write on a piece of parchment, it stands still and no longer takes dictation until another piece of parchment is provided.

•	Sketching Quill: This small quill, over the course of one minute, can transcribe a small image in black ink onto a piece of parchment, needing no ink or hand to control it. The quill will start to sketch a scene the caster can see, so long as the caster continues looking at the scene, as if you were concentrating on a spell. The quill can only sketch a still scene, and cannot sketch a creature or object in motion. If the image is too large for the piece of parchment, the quill will fill in as much of the parchment as possible before standing still, and will no longer sketch until more parchment is provided.

Lemme know what you think!

First off, hoping none of the people from my group wil be reading this, if so, /shoo.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I did my very first oneshot (We Be Goblins) as DM for a part of my D&amp;D group. This saturday, I will be doing my second oneshot, this time I am writing my own oneshot after feedback given since the last session. The feedback consisted, among others, of one or more members feeling like they didn't have enough options to choose their own path.

So now, I decided to basically have them pick one of 3 quests and let them have at it.

When asking for input what the players would like to encounter, they answered GIANTS. Fair enough, lets toss some giants into it.

The party consists of 6 lvl 5 PCs; Paladin, Blood Hunter, Moondruid, Bearbarian (Moondruid 2/Ancestral Guardian Barbarian 3), Drunken Master Monk and Lore Bard.

&amp;#x200B;

Now however, I am running out of inspiration as to what mobs they are to encounter.

The premise of the quest: They are asked by one of the teachers from the Mages College to find 3 missing students. The 3 Goliath students ran off with an artifact from the Mages College and went back to their town. The town is an ancient ruin on top of a long abandoned mine and consists of various outcasts from other Giant-clans/herds (Ogre, Ogrillon, Hill Giants and Goliaths). They live somewhat isolated from the other races as the perception of Giantkin is not too favourable (racism because giants are stupid and violent, the usual).

The mine beneath the town is abandoned for about 30 years after the Duergar that resided there delved too deep and awakened something. Now I can find plenty of cave dwelling, underdark lurking, not-too-keen-on-sunlight type of monsters to fill such a mine, but I want to give the party some giants to fight as well. Problem is, I am having difficulties finding giants that might live there that can provide a challenge for the 6 lvl5 partymembers without resorting to the Hill Giant/Ogre/Ogrillon.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on Gianttype monsters that would provide a challenge to these people or something that can make a fight more challenging in the setting they are in (dark damp cavern)?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow Redditeers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I did my very first oneshot (We Be Goblins) as DM for a part of my D&amp;amp;D group. This saturday, I will be doing my second oneshot, this time I am writing my own oneshot after feedback given since the last session. The feedback consisted, among others, of one or more members feeling like they didn&amp;#39;t have enough options to choose their own path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, I decided to basically have them pick one of 3 quests and let them have at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asking for input what the players would like to encounter, they answered GIANTS. Fair enough, lets toss some giants into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party consists of 6 lvl 5 PCs; Paladin, Blood Hunter, Moondruid, Bearbarian (Moondruid 2/Ancestral Guardian Barbarian 3), Drunken Master Monk and Lore Bard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now however, I am running out of inspiration as to what mobs they are to encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the quest: They are asked by one of the teachers from the Mages College to find 3 missing students. The 3 Goliath students ran off with an artifact from the Mages College and went back to their town. The town is an ancient ruin on top of a long abandoned mine and consists of various outcasts from other Giant-clans/herds (Ogre, Ogrillon, Hill Giants and Goliaths). They live somewhat isolated from the other races as the perception of Giantkin is not too favourable (racism because giants are stupid and violent, the usual).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mine beneath the town is abandoned for about 30 years after the Duergar that resided there delved too deep and awakened something. Now I can find plenty of cave dwelling, underdark lurking, not-too-keen-on-sunlight type of monsters to fill such a mine, but I want to give the party some giants to fight as well. Problem is, I am having difficulties finding giants that might live there that can provide a challenge for the 6 lvl5 partymembers without resorting to the Hill Giant/Ogre/Ogrillon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on Gianttype monsters that would provide a challenge to these people or something that can make a fight more challenging in the setting they are in (dark damp cavern)?&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the players are very experienced and very patient with me. We usually have around six lvl 7 players which can be a challenge.

I am basically running a modified version of ""Out of the Abyss"". It has been a lot of fun because the party has very little knowledge of the UD. They are murder hobos' which works well in the UD because most of the monsters and NPC's want to kill them. 

The party is currently in Gracklstugh and has decided to join an attempted coup to overthrow the Mad King. The party has an assassin that is dead set on killing the King.

My main question is how should I handle the party's encounter with the King's Stone guard? 

The duegars will be invisible and will be around 50 of them. Seems like an easy TPK especially if you add the King. My thought is too add some of their duergar allies in the battle but that is where I am at a loss.

How do I incorporate Mass combat and traditional small scale Pc v NPC combat? 

 I want to create the sense of battles throughout the streets and an overall sense of all out war. I feel somewhat comfortable with the mass combat mechanics and plan on using duergar messengers/runners to keep the party in the loop of the ongoing battle as they proceed thru the city.

Also, last session the only dwarven PC sucker punched one of their duergar allies during an argument. The duergar let it go at the time but he is planning to kill the PC if the opportunity arises during the upcoming battle. Duergars hold grudges and hate surface dwarves so it is completely justified. My concern is the PC will think I am singling him out.  
Maybe he is knocked unconscious and taking as a prisoner to be used as leverage if the party turns on their duergar allies?  

Hopefully this makes some sense and appreciate any advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a new, and probably too nice, GM that has been running a weekly campaign for the last 4 months.

So I'm fairly new to D&amp;D and had been thinking about creating a homebrew Samurai class before noticing there was a Samurai Fighter archetype in XGtE. It mentions that the intention for this archetype was to recreate the cinematic feel as closely as possible while remaining within the perimeters of the game world. Upon reading through the features, I wasn't left very impressed by it. This did get me to pay more attention to the Fighter, however, as a class to base my samurai on. The Battle Master archetype already gets way closer to my vision of a samurai than the XGtE archetype seemed to be. It just requires a additions and tweaks. I've based these additions mostly off of my favorite Japanese styles – Iaido. I'm asking for everyone's help in ensuring the wording and balance are correct. Also, feel free to offer up names you think would be better.

These are my homebrew additions to the Fighter's ""Battle Master"" archetype.
Thanks for the suggestions. Please keep them coming. Presenting **Sword Release v0.2**

&gt; ***Sword Release*** (Optional subclass feature)
&gt; 
&gt; If you choose to take this feature once you enter the Battle Master archetype, you forfeit your current Fighting Style and lose any of the benefits it provided. Instead, you learn the Iaido Fighting Style. 
&gt; 
&gt; Using this feature, you learn to dispatch your foes before they ever see you draw your blade. You may use a bonus action on your turn to stow your melee weapon and enter a low fighting posture, ready to release your weapon and strike at a moment’s notice. This is your Sword Release stance. While in this stance, you gain +1 AC and are granted +1 to the next melee weapon attack you make from this stance. If the attack hits, you may also add +1 to the damage roll. You leave this stance once you attack, if you are knocked prone, or if a suitable weapon is not accessible to you. Additionally, the Maneuvers you may use while in this stance are limited to those which utilize this feature.
&gt; 
&gt; To use this feature, both hands must be free until you attack. Your melee weapon must deal slashing damage and must not have the Heavy weapon property. When you make a melee weapon attack from this stance with a Versatile weapon, you may calculate the attack’s damage as if you were holding the weapon with two hands.

.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; **Fighting Style**
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;**Iaido**
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;You may use a bonus action to enter the Sword Release stance.
 
***Maneuvers***

&gt; **Arterial Strike.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack from your Sword Release stance, you can expend one superiority die to deeply wound the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you have inflicted a bleeding effect on the target. At the start of each of its turns until the effect ends, the bleeding target takes damage equal to your Dexterity modifier. At the end of its turns, a bleeding creature can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends for that creature. The effect also ends if the target receives any magical healing. Bleeding does not effect undead or constructs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vanishing Strike.** When you are within 10 feet of a creature you can see while in your Sword Release stance on your turn, you may expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, you instantly appear in the space immediately opposite your target. You do not expend movement or provoke an attack of opportunity using this maneuver. If that space is occupied or inaccessible, you remain in your space and can continue your turn as normal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Blunt Edge.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack from your Sword Release stance, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to stun the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn. Your weapon deals bludgeoning damage for this attack.
&gt; 
&gt; **Riposte.** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. (Homebrew Addition:) You may use this maneuver from your Sword Release stance.

.

^Still ^waiting ^on ^improvements ^for:
&gt; **Defensive Posture.** If you are holding a melee weapon on your turn, you may use your action to expend one superiority die and enter a balanced stance until the start of your next turn. This stance ends early if you move or are knocked prone. While in this stance, you cannot take any of your normal reactions. Instead, whenever another creature damages you with a weapon attack, you may roll your superiority die and reduce the damage by the number rolled + your Dexterity modifier. You may then make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within your melee weapon’s range. If you hit, the damage you deal is equal to the number rolled on your superiority die. Repeat this process each time you take weapon damage during this stance. 

Defensive Posture is based on kendo’s chudan-no-kamae posture where strikes may often occur simultaneously, also known as ai-uchi, and result in mutual death during actual combat.

I'm choosing Tinker's Tools, which the Artificer is proficient in.

Under Spellcasting, the Artificer's description also reads:

You	produce	your artificer	spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s	tool—in	hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.

And the Artificer's Spellcasting Ability is Intelligence. DC and Attack Mod are calculated by adding 8 + Int Mod + Proficiency Mod.

All these facts together seem to \*imply\* that this character could add double its proficiency modifier for the sake of Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Modifier, but nothing I've found says it explicitly, and no other class works this way (AFAIK).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m choosing Tinker&amp;#39;s Tools, which the Artificer is proficient in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Spellcasting, the Artificer&amp;#39;s description also reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You produce your artificer  spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s    tool—in   hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Artificer&amp;#39;s Spellcasting Ability is Intelligence. DC and Attack Mod are calculated by adding 8 + Int Mod + Proficiency Mod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these facts together seem to *imply* that this character could add double its proficiency modifier for the sake of Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Modifier, but nothing I&amp;#39;ve found says it explicitly, and no other class works this way (AFAIK). Obviously a DM could allow this if they liked the flavor (and I do!) but do the rules actually back up my conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Wow! That seems pretty definitive. Too bad, but I appreciate your help!&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to bounce a quick idea I have for a Homebrew sandbox campaign where most magic items have limited charges, and once those charges are spent the item turns mundane.

I'm mostly thinking of armor and weapons right. An example: a +1 longsword has 50 charges. When you make an attack roll (hit or miss), you use a charge. After all charges are spent it turns into a normal longsword. 

Same for armor, whenever an enemy makes an attack against you, whether it hits or misses, you subtract a charge.

Perhaps all items lose a charge at midnight regardless to prevent magic hording items with low charges for that ""just in case"" moment.

I'm mostly looking for a fun factor. Would people consider this fun if it was fully fleshed out? I realize losing a cool magic affect on an item might be a drag but I'm hoping it gives a lot more incentive to dungeon delve and explore.

I'm currently playing a Cleric, and a few sessions ago we had a really rough battle where my PC died and another was abducted, then also killed.

There were 4 of us at level 5 (at the time) and we were fighting 3 Cambions, which are apparently CR 5 fiends. We got overconfident and separated a significant distance over the battlefield (a market square in a city in the dead of night) trying to chase down 2 of the Cambions at once, and the Bard and Warlock were soon out of range of my healing spells.

The Cambion that myself and our EK fighter were taking on got in some nasty hits despite us both having heavy armour, and the third Cambion was flying around in between us getting free fire rays off on everyone. I went down first, and all 3 Cambions then dived on the other two. I got a nat 1 on my first death save, then the EK failed a medicine check to stabilize me, and I failed my next death save as well, so I died.

The Warlock and Bard both got taken down as well, and the Cambions circled around the Bard and vanished with him while the EK was running over, thinking it was going to be a TPK.

The Bard then had some solo RP with the DM, announcing about 5 minutes later that he was dead as well. Luckily, we had just saved the political leader of the city we were in from an illness that was being caused by another fiendish presence, related to the Cambions, and she had some ties with the temple of Chauntea, so my PC got resurrected, but the Bard had been killed on another plane after refusing to make a deal with Graz'zt, so he rerolled a Fighter.

Seeing as I am now the only source of healing (we also have a Rogue and a Monk, who weren't at that session - we usually only have 4 or 5 players available on any given weekend), I want to roll a backup PC who can heal in case I die again in the middle of nowhere.

I don't want to just make another Cleric though, as that would kind of feel like the typical scenario of Bob the barbarian dying only for his previously unmentioned brother Rob with an identical character sheet rocking up to replace him.

I decided on a Gnome Theurgy Wizard, taking Life domain, and that's where my question comes in... has anybody else noticed that the Gnomish pantheon has no Life domain deities? The only other pantheon that doesn't have one is the Drow pantheon. I know I can just ask the DM to let me choose one of the other Gnome gods, or choose one from the main Faerun pantheon, but I think it's kind of strange that there just isn't one, period.

I am already playing a divine soul / celestial warlock in my other main group, and druid doesn't really appeal to me.. I've wanted to play a support wizard for quite a while so I figure I can make him as my backup, but also have it ready to go if I happen to find a third group that I can fit into my schedule (in which case I will make something else as my backup for the Cleric PC).

I'm writing because I'm in need of advice: I'd like to play a wizard (or other spellcaster) that uses a ""flying sword"" in combat, controlling it with the mind in order to make ranged attacks. I'd also like to be able to ""transmit"" the (offensive) spells that require a touch through the sword (not too differently from what familiars do).

I'd like to have the sword constantly hovering next to me, and be able to use it to attack without daily limits, if possible.  
If possible, I'd like for this to be a skill of the class itself, not because of spells or magic items.

In order to do this I'd like to find, homebrew or reflavor a class or subclass of DnD 5e; problem is, I'm not too knowledgeable about DnD 5e, so I'm not able to do a homebrew alone - at least, not a balanced one.

I already know about Mordenkainen's Sword and dancing swords and they're not what I'm looking for (although I'll probably use them as well). 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, this is a wizard archetype from Pathfinder that almost does what I'd like to do in 5e, only problem being that it has a daily limit for the usage of the sword:

I&amp;#39;m writing because I&amp;#39;m in need of advice: I&amp;#39;d like to play a wizard (or other spellcaster) that uses a &amp;quot;flying sword&amp;quot; in combat, controlling it with the mind in order to make ranged attacks. I&amp;#39;d also like to be able to &amp;quot;transmit&amp;quot; the (offensive) spells that require a touch through the sword (not too differently from what familiars do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to have the sword constantly hovering next to me, and be able to use it to attack without daily limits, if possible.&lt;br/&gt;
If possible, I&amp;#39;d like for this to be a skill of the class itself, not because of spells or magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this I&amp;#39;d like to find, homebrew or reflavor a class or subclass of DnD 5e; problem is, I&amp;#39;m not too knowledgeable about DnD 5e, so I&amp;#39;m not able to do a homebrew alone - at least, not a balanced one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already know about Mordenkainen&amp;#39;s Sword and dancing swords and they&amp;#39;re not what I&amp;#39;m looking for (although I&amp;#39;ll probably use them as well). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, this is a wizard archetype from Pathfinder that almost does what I&amp;#39;d like to do in 5e, only problem being that it has a daily limit for the usage of the sword:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/archetypes/paizo-wizard-archetypes/sword-binder-wizard/""&gt;https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/archetypes/paizo-wizard-archetypes/sword-binder-wizard/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always for reference, this is a video of a videogame character (Guild Wars 2) that kind of does what I&amp;#39;d like to be able to do:  &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMEGRzwPvuY""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMEGRzwPvuY&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a couple of images:  &lt;a href=""https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/pages/2017/september/immortaljourney/img/imm-yi-full.jpg?v=1""&gt;https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/pages/2017/september/immortaljourney/img/imm-yi-full.jpg?v=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d really appreciate if anyone could help me in this. &lt;/p&gt;

Below is the text explaining the change for my players at the outset of a new campaign - I think it explains what I'd like to do, why, and the mechanics behind it. It's inspired by Burning Wheel but I think still sufficiently D&amp;D that I'm not totally trying to have my cake and eat it too. All my players DM as well so they know their stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quest and Goal-based experience**

I’m adjusting the milestone experience model for this campaign to encompass the completion of quests I give you as well as achieving goals characters set. I don’t have much to say about Quest-based experience – if you complete a quest or reach a milestone, I’ll award the party experience.

Goal-based experience is more complex so I want to share why I’m doing this, the mechanics of how it will work, and provide some examples.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why use Goal-based experience**

I think the biggest problem with D&amp;D is that characters are painfully static. The only real mechanics used to express character growth is increasing level, gaining better loot, and becoming infinitely wealthy. That’s fun and simple, but I think it makes characters really two dimensional.

Goal-based experience is about making characters dynamic. What they think and feel about the world – and how they grow and change from interacting with it – isn’t mechanically in the game. The number one reason I’m introducing this system is to try and change that.

Briefly there are a few other benefits;

* Your goals are a way for you to communicate to me and other players what interests you about the game – it presents avenues for exploration, ideas for quests I can develop, and can deepen relationships with players as you get into the habit of collaborating on goals.
* It cuts down on the amount of preparation the DM needs to do dramatically. I’ll know what you care about, want to pursue, and get ideas from you – it makes us co-creators of a shared narrative rather than me trying to railroad you into an adventure you may only be partially interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does it work?**

1. Everyone advances level at the same rate. Goal-based experience doesn’t mean you’re fighting to get your way or lead the party every session – it’s an opportunity to share the spotlight.
2. We’ll explicitly talk about your Goals before each session, or over the pre-game dinner. We want people to be clear on what everyone wants to do so you can decide as a group what to pursue.
3. You can abandon or change goals between sessions. Just like a real person your characters perspectives and priorities will change often. This is a good thing – it’s representative of your characters evolving thoughts, feelings, and priorities.
4. If you’re changing goals, you need to post that to our Campaign Forum by noon on Saturday. Not changing in a given week is totally fine – it’s okay to take the back seat for a session or two. See (1) in this section.
5. Goals are a conversation between the DM and the players. I do, however, reserve the right to approve, deny, or suggest changes to them – but this will always be done in the spirit of fairness and good narrative!
6. You each start with two Goal slots.

a. **Current goal:** These relate to either the situation the party is in or a story thread you want to explore. I’ll describe, with examples, below.

b. **Character goal:** These relate to either a PC or NPC that shine a spotlight on the relationship and how it should change. They exist to deepen bonds and manage conflict in interesting ways. I’ll describe, with examples, below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current goals in play**

These relate to either the situation the party is in, or a story thread you want to explore. They explicitly tell me what to prepare between sessions and to help all the players understand how your character thinks and feels about current circumstances.

Here are some examples:

Lets say we have a session after the PCs have returned to a major city after completing a quest. You have no immediate quests on the horizon and I have a blank slate from a planning perspective. We’re a few weeks into the campaign though and I’ve dropped any number of hints about different storylines you could pursue.

* The party cleric might think about a rumour I mentioned in a previous session about Demon worship among the local aristocracy. The cleric thinks that’s an awesome idea and wants to include it in the next phase of our story. \*\*So they write a goal: “\*\****I will discern the truth of these rumours and learn who among the aristocracy are worshiping dark powers.”***

Current goals can also relate to a specific quest if you have one. And it's not a bad thing if you try to ""double dip"" and get Quest and Goal XP - so long as they're good goals that enhance the narrative. With that in mind lets say I’ve given you the quest to kill the Mad Mage of Undermountain.

* The Rogue character might decide their family was killed by the Mad Mage. This could be existing cannon from their backstory, or something that’s proposed between sessions. They like the idea of this bringing out a vengeful side of their character, a side that will take risks to strike the killing blow against this enemy. They write the goal, ***“the Mad Mage will pay for what they did to my family – they MUST die by my hand.***
* The Wizard, who plays a mostly stereotypical power-hungry type, might decide that while they support this quest they also want to steal the Mad Mage’s terrible arcane secrets. They decide to propose an additional element to the quest and canon about the Mad Mage by writing the goal of, ***“I will uncover the mysteries of the Mad Mage’s hidden laboratory!”***As a DM I can now go off and make a map and encounter with whatever Frankenstein/Flesh Golem monster the Mad Mage was perfecting in their hidden lab. I can choose to go a step further and decide this is a hidden location and that you’ll need to first figure out where it is before it can be raided.

From these examples I think it’s obvious how helpful it will be for the DM of a sandbox-style game to get a snapshot of what the PCs care about before any given session. With goals you help create the story and lessen my burden and chance of burnout.

&amp;#x200B;

**Character goals in play**

Character goals relate to either a PC or NPC that are meant to put you in your characters mindset. They exist to deepen the bonds between characters and make for a richer story. They’re also a way of heightening drama and managing conflict between players.

Lets continue the stories from above for our examples.

* The Cleric, who is intent on uncovering demonic influence within the aristocracy, knows that uncovering these cults will require subterfuge and connections they don’t have. They know the Rogue character has a Noble background and is estranged from their family. They write the goal, ***“I will help the Rogue reconcile with their father and convince them to help us purge evil influences upon the aristocracy.”***
* Before the session the Rogue character agrees this will make for a great story, but they want to expand on it and flavour it more to their feud with the family. They write the goal, ***“It’s time my father and I talked about how he squandered my inheritance. I’ve seen the good in him and he can atone by helping us uncover the cult.”***

I now have queues for an awesome adventure that includes character backstory, a chance for a meaningful NPC interaction, and a quest to infiltrate an aristocratic cult. This is awesome!

For those not familiar with the system, after creating a broad stroke character concept each player comes up with an origin story or pivotal, defining moment for their character. This should be no more than a few sentences.

Then, two other players (chosen arbitrarily or at random) have to somehow cross paths with each other player. They could be a rival, an old friend, a random chance encounter and now they're meeting again, etc. This should also only be a few sentences. It ensured that nobody knew everybody in the party beforehand but everybody knew somebody else and they all shared mutual acquaintances. 

We spent the majority of our session zero on this, leaving everyone to handle their mechanical character creation on their own time. 

We ended up with a well fleshed out party that was ingrained into the city of Waterdeep. There were some really satisfying connections made in the party that we never would have thought of without being forced down a given path. 

Constraint breeds creativity. And being nudged to non-obvious and non-cliche connections bore wonderful fruit.

&amp;#x200B;

The two ways that spell slots work in 5e from what I've been told and from what I've gleamed from research has been:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Spell slots are essentially mana, meaning that if you have five level 1 spell slots then you can cast any level 1 spell five times per day, i.e. one level 1 spell multiple times or a combination of level 1 spells over the course of the day as I see fit.

or

&amp;#x200B;

2. At the start of each day, I have to pick which spells I assign to whichever spell slots, meaning that if I have eight level 1 spells, and only five level 1 slots, then I have to pick which of the eight that I think I'll need to use that day, and have to assign multiple slots to the same spell if I feel I need to use it multiple times. (i.e. if I want to use, say, burning hands multiple times in a single day, then I have to preemptively assign it to a few of my limited spell slots at the start of the day and can't change my choice until the next long rest)

&amp;#x200B;

The general answer that I've found from research is that it's the first method that's used in 5e, but from what I've heard in my circle of friends, the show Critical Role uses the second system so we're a bit confused on the ruling, despite what the book says. I haven't watched Critical Role so I don't know if the claim about them using the second method is true and if it is, whether or not it's one of their house rules. I'm asking here to get clarification.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find conclusive answers to this, where I&amp;#39;ve heard conflicting reports about how spell slots work for the wizard class, so I&amp;#39;ve come here to see if my luck will be better.&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short, my warlock is searching for a new patron because of story reasons.

I need some helpt not screwing up my character and making it fun and effective (its a meatgrinder campain, so optimization is kinda important)

Rules:  
Keep all the spells and invocations I already have that are not related to my current patron. The other ones can be swapped out. I can choose a new pact if I so choose

I used to be a hexblade bladelock with stats:  
Level 5  
STR: 11  
DEX: 14  
CON: 16  
INT: 12  
WIS: 14  
CHA: 18  
Polearm master (from variant human)

The invocations I now have are:  
Thirsting blade (can be swapped out)  
Tomb of Levistus  
Agonizing blast

Notes:  
The options are basically Celestial and Fey (because of the setting).  
I'm losing my medium armor proficiency and shield proficiency aswell.  
We have a sorcadin that is blind, so something around darkness/devil's sight can be a strong combo with her (she has blind sight in 15 feet so she'd get advantage too).

Any ideas to make myself relevant in the party (mostly as a damage dealer preferably)?

(5e) Human (Mark of Passage), Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron


&gt;Shared Passage


&gt;As a bonus action you can teleport a distance up to your walking speed, ending in an unoccupied space that you can see. You can bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you use this trait. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


This ability seems like an all-round better version of Misty Step. Is that true, or am I missing something? 


&gt;Misty Step


&gt;2nd-level conjuration, Casting Time: 1 bonus action, Range: Self, Components: V, Duration: Instantaneous


&gt;Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.


---


The improvements seem to be:


- Doesn't require level 3 to use


- Doesn't cost a spell slot


- Doesn't need to be prepared (Wizard only)


- Doesn't need to be a selected spell (Sorcerers/Warlocks/Wizards pick spells on level-up)


- Isn't a spell for the sake of mechanics (such as Rage or Counterspell)


- Doesn't require a Verbal component


- Scales with walking speed / speed (as opposed to a flat 30 ft)


- Doesn't spend your ""one spell per turn"", allowing you to cast another spell


- **You can bring one willing creature**


Downsides to this are:


- Requires a specific race


- Once per long rest


---


Is it just me, or is this ability really situationally good? 


I've played a Wizard recently, and always prepared Misty Step, and the only times I've ever *wanted* to spend the 2nd-level-spell-slot on mobility, there's always been a more appropriate spell for the situation, which means out of all the sessions I've had, I never ended up using Misty Step (despite it costing me the prepared spell slot this whole time). 


This, combined with another noteworthy ability:


&gt;Intuitive Motion. When you make a Strength (Athletics) check ~~or any ability check to operate or maintain a land vehicle,~~ you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.


Adding a d4 to grapple attacks? Yes please.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t require level 3 to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t cost a spell slot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t need to be prepared (Wizard only)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t need to be a selected spell (Sorcerers/Warlocks/Wizards pick spells on level-up)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t a spell for the sake of mechanics (such as Rage or Counterspell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t require a Verbal component&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scales with walking speed / speed (as opposed to a flat 30 ft)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t spend your &amp;quot;one spell per turn&amp;quot;, allowing you to cast another spell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can bring one willing creature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downsides to this are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requires a specific race&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once per long rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or is this ability really situationally good? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve played a Wizard recently, and always prepared Misty Step, and the only times I&amp;#39;ve ever &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to spend the 2nd-level-spell-slot on mobility, there&amp;#39;s always been a more appropriate spell for the situation, which means out of all the sessions I&amp;#39;ve had, I never ended up using Misty Step (despite it costing me the prepared spell slot this whole time). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, combined with another noteworthy ability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitive Motion. When you make a Strength (Athletics) check &lt;del&gt;or any ability check to operate or maintain a land vehicle,&lt;/del&gt; you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a d4 to grapple attacks? Yes please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you made use of the Shared Passage ability? Any thoughts on how it stacks up to Misty Step? Is there another noteworthy teleport ability that I should compare them to? (Far Step is 5th level and requires Concentration)&lt;/p&gt;

The building itself is a mimic, all the staff and other patrons are part of the facade and the mimic waits for everyone to go to sleep for an easy meal. 

The other idea; They’re actually taking part in a stage production which is taking place in a tavern. Something terrible happens after introductions and the like play gets interrupted. Could make for a somewhat more interesting beginning.

I want to give them a different option, a moral choice of bring the giants together, competing quests for them and having them all return to King Hekaton's court. Once all together, all the giant lords and the players will go kill a suped up Iymrith. In the other option, they kill all the giant lords, then Iymrith and the party go kill a betraying Slarkrathel together then finish off Hekaton.

I am DM'ing a game right now and things are about to get wild for my party. The setting is at a summer camp, with a deep dark secret, and each player is in a cabin based on one of the 6 skills (STR/DEX/CHA, etc.) They had a team challenge that required the team to be assigned an NPC named Hank, a human bard from the Charisma cabin. The next leg of the campaign takes them into a dungeon of a powerful necromancer lich which hides the dark past about the camp and the previous headmaster.  The party broke into the current headmasters house and found clues about the previous headmaster and escaped without being caught, but the headmaster did detect the Wizard of our group (the party doesnt know that.).    

They will face a variety of challenges all based on the skills they are gaining while at camp, and all VERY dangerous. Since none of my players are bards (or particularly skilled in charisma) I'm sending Hank along with them as there is a musical-based obstacle that I seriously dont think the party will get through without a bards help, if they will accept his help. My assumption is they will.    

During our last game, I secretly gave the wizard in our party a note at the end of the session that was addressed from the headmaster of the camp that just said ""when the time comes, trust Hank."" I do not know his feelings about the note.    

I want to give the party some  ownership of including or not including Hank, either before or during the dungeon encounter. My party already doesnt like bards.

Does anyone have any experience in trying to do this, and can give any tips?

I figured the most logical way to condense the rest of the adventure down into 5 sessions would be to take out part 4, the Wave Echo Cave, and change some stuff around to make the campaign end naturally when they save Gundren Rockseeker. This especially feels right because the main complaint I hear about LMoP is that the last section of the adventure is pretty anticlimactic, and after reading through it I have a tendency to agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any experience in trying to do this, and can give any tips? The party hasn&amp;#39;t heard the name &amp;quot;the black spider&amp;quot; yet, should I keep him in and just make him appear in Cragmaw Castle, or take him out altogether? Any general advice about how to run the next two chapters would be appreciated too; this is my first time DMing.&lt;/p&gt;

History:

This temple once was use to worship Umberlee The Bitch Queen. She saw it fit to house her most valuable treasure within this temple (female sphynx on top floor) However, as time went on and steam came into production people started fearing her less and less. This lead to fewer and fewer pilgrimage from those seeking her blessing. Eventually the temple stopped recieving visitors. Eventually a Medusa moved in with some lizardmen.

Seeing this as the perfect place to house it's aquariam, a Morkoth moved into the lowest level, and has been collecting aquatic, and undead creatures within it's depths. No one has dared venture out to the temple since it fell into the lake, fearing reprisal.

A group of undead found this temple to be the perfect place to hold a dimensional tether so that they can gather their forces before attacking and corrupting the world above. They have no knowledge of the Morkoth beneath, and are unaware that they have become a part of his collection.

### Characters

**Aukan ”Uvenkrig” Thullaga, Goliath Conquest Paladin.** A goliath who lost his tribe and family when another tribe conquered them. Made a deal with a devil (not the last time) to gain enough power to free his people.

**Aelmara, Wood Elven Sure Shot Monk.** An old elf who lives in the Underdark hunting creatures who upset the balance of the world. Found the party after their biggest defeat at the hands of a Dracolich. Little was known.

**Clovis, ~~Half-elf Necromancer~~ Undead Lich.** A young half-elf who searched for everlasting life, since earlier generations died to an uncureable disease. A... complicated relationship with the rest of the party.

**Hel ""Barrivilli"" Torsdottir, Mountainborn Human Hexblade Warlock.** A human who almost lost her life at a young age, she took this as divine intervention and entered in service to Bahamut. She later realized that the Raven Queen was the one who had taken an interest in her life... and service.

Note: Heavily modified Hexblade class.

&lt;p&gt;If yes, how much healing, and how often do you think makes sense?(I am guessing 1d4, maybe a number of uses equal to wisdom modifier).&lt;/p&gt;

For example, take a look at all of the weapons that do 1d4 damage, the dagger is obviously the best, light, thrown, finesse, then the strength version of the dagger, the light hammer. Then there’s the dart, finesse and thrown, with the only upside probably being that you’d be able to carry a bunch for throwing compared to daggers. Then there’s the whip, which has a new damage type (slashing, as opposed to piercing), with reach and finesse, so at least it has reach to make it have use, but it’s also a martial weapon!! Who with martial proficiency would use a whip for 1d4 damage when you could use anything else, like darts. Then you get to the disappointing end, with the club, which is only good if you use shillelagh which isn’t even in the phb, and the sickle, which is just the worst and has no reason to be picked, not finesse (which to me should have been obvious for it to have), can’t throw it because ofc, and only a d4 of damage.

Yea different damage types but there aren’t enough enemies with resistance to only one type of physical damage to warrant having multiple of these for he variety, why not just pick the best option? Why should you be penalized for wanting a Character to be quirky and use a different weapon, pretty much everyone funnels into dagger and rapier for finesse weapons. The only class of weapons I feel aren’t that big of a problem are the heavy two handed weapons, the main difference is how they add up damage (I.e. 2d6 v 1d12) or trading off a little damage for reach (glaive v greataxe)
And the versatile weapons feel kinda bad too, like the quarterstaff being pretty much the same as the trident, except the trident gets thrown property at the cost of martial proficiency which to me is a lot.
And there are weapons like the mace that have absolutely no use, it does the same damage as a one handed quarterstaff. Think about that, a mace and a quarterstaff, a hunk of metal and a small wooden pole do the same amount of strength based damage.
The easy way out in all of this is just using one weapons stat block and just flavor it like it’s another weapon but I don’t like that, I hate having to switch everything around and just use my one generic weapon statblock because only one of the weapons is worth it. 
giving more enemies resistances to one type or two of physical damage would make it worth it, or buffing weapons that are just objectively worse would also help.

Dragonlance, even with its ownership issues under Margarat Weiss/Tracey Hickman I still think will eventually get something in 5E eventually, as Tracey collaborated with Wizard's for Curse of Strahd.

But Dark Sun and Dragonlance have some funny timeline issues. When initially released as campaign settings they started as well-defined lands with governments, alliances and power structures. But since that initial release, they've had their ""timeline"" greatly expanded.

In the case of Dark Sun, what started with I think about eleven city-states and sorcerer-kings was the main draw and struggle of the setting. But Dark Sun got itself a whole set of novels, and some adventure modules, that last left off with leaving only six sorcerer kings left alive, two of them being sort-of good and a third trapped in Ravenloft.

With Dragonlance, the author and co-creator Weiss kept churning out novels bringing the settings story a several massive wars ahead of its initial launch, with some pretty world-defining changes on the way. There been a War of the Lance, War of Souls, and the two big gods Paladine and Takhisis have lost their divinity.

So the dillemma is essentially this; do you release a campaign book for these settings by establishing a retcon, essentially saying ""That stuff in the novels/modules isn't really canon, the setting hasn't moved."" Dark Sun has done this in the past. Or do you do the Forgotten Realms path, and say ""That stuff did happen, you play in the present and everything detailed in previous modules/novels is the setting's history.""

In my point of view, I think these new campaign books should put a foot in both camps. They should detail the events of the past from novels and modules as a brief outline, and explain enough details that DMs could feel comfortable replaying those events/modules if they so choose (so you can fight the dragon Borys or Verminaard if you want). But lso detail the present, so that DMs can also feel free to create their own world-shaking events, characters and plotlines within the setting's present if they choose.

So for example, in the case of Dark Sun, do a brief overview of the history of the sorcerer-kings (all of them), explain the conflicts in the modules/novels in which some of them perished, and give some background for how DMs could set games in that previous age. But then also give details about the ""current"" year, and the current status of cities and their kings, so that DMs can take the remaining threads and run with them (instead of feeling boxed to replay what has already been made). There should be some new details added to the ""present"" year for adventure hooks to be devised (like the Thri-Keen Empire, or about Daskinor's rumored actions).

Same with Dragonlance, in that they should give details on the War of the Lance and the War of Souls, and the key players in those events so DMs can feel like they could play in those timelines. But also add enough details to the current year so that DMs can run games post-novels as well, with some flavor pieces (maybe Kitiara is rumored resurrected as a servant of Chemosh or something, I dunno).

So those are my ideas. Is everything I wrote just total bunk and they should retcon it all, or completely move forward like Forgotten Realms does, or am I onto something?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So since Ravnica has been released, I&amp;#39;m thinking it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time (even though it may be a LONG time) that Dark Sun and Dragonlance get a campaign book of their own.

There should be some new details added to the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; year for adventure hooks to be devised (like the Thri-Keen Empire, or about Daskinor&amp;#39;s rumored actions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same with Dragonlance, in that they should give details on the War of the Lance and the War of Souls, and the key players in those events so DMs can feel like they could play in those timelines. But also add enough details to the current year so that DMs can run games post-novels as well, with some flavor pieces (maybe Kitiara is rumored resurrected as a servant of Chemosh or something, I dunno).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are my ideas. Is everything I wrote just total bunk and they should retcon it all, or completely move forward like Forgotten Realms does, or am I onto something?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Ability Score Increase (12).** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

**Age.** Individual Xkrith live around three months, though through replacing lost of drones, you are effectively immortal.

**Alignment.** A complex relationship with mortality and physical existence leads most Sha'rax Ti to be Chaotic, often tending towards evil alignments.

**Size.** Though your swarm's total number varies considerably from day to day, you require enough drones to fill a Medium Humanoid to maintain consciousness.

**Speed (-2).** The restriction of inhabiting a body reduces the speed it would normally be capable of. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Aberrant Nature (0).** You have two creature types: aberration and humanoid. You can be affected by any game effects that target either of these types.

**Buzzing Swarm (0).** You can perform verbal components for spells through the chittering, writhing and quivering sounds of your bodies.

**Cyclic Rest (4).** You rotate the time when your drones are resting, keeping many awake at all times. You do not need to sleep and can complete a long rest by performing 6 hours of light activity.

**Infested Host (6).** You survive by infesting the corpse of a medium humanoid. This corpse is considered your *Host*. While the swarm can replace the drones lost from injury or time, it cannot repair the corpse it inhabits. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, your *Host* will become damaged. While your *Host* is undamaged, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary member of your *Host's* race, though your actions may give you away. While your *Host* is damaged, other creatures are more easily able to recognise you as Sha'Rax-Ti.

If you have access to a medium humanoid corpse, you can choose to infest it over the course of a Short Rest and make it your new *Host*. You must complete a long rest before you can infest another corpse.

**Mental Touch (6).** The collective mental prowess of your swarm allows you to reach out to the minds of others. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

**Psychically Unstable (-8).** The psychic connection that holds your swarm together is a fragile thing. You have vulnerability to psychic damage.

**Purge the Infected. (6)** By removing weakened drones from the swarm, you can prevent the spread of dangerous substances. You have resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.

**Languages (0).** You are not capable of speech yourself, but you can understand, read and write Common and one other language of your choice.

I' really happy about this, but it leaves me with two potential issues, so I thought I'd ask here on them, as people here can help save me from myself, when my changes, and stupid ideas take root.

1. Railroading: I've added a secondary batch of things to the ""typical"" CoS campaign, to try and make each of the characters feel like they were chosen for a reason, by Barovia's Darklord, and while the players sort of know that, and several of the ""triggers"" have been done, there is one more big one, and I am thinking of hitting it tonight. The problem is, once it is tripped, the party probably shouldn't leave the castle, and beating Strahd/staying alive becomes the only goal. He's been keen to let them screw around, but at that point, he's set to do them in, and get his reward. If I don't hit the trigger, though, and they run into Strahd, anyway, it would be pretty hard to later drop it in; this might be the best time to do it, and also maybe end this campaign, so people can maybe win, and play something else. There are still locales of Barovia they haven't checked, but they might never, and have found most of the goodies. How much ""railroading"" should I risk? Most campaigns have a ""and we're going to fight the BBEG, but not CoS, and even going to the castle isn't guaranteeing you don't leave; several events only happen if you *did* go to the castle, do some stuff, and then go other places. What might be the best way to handle this?

2. Optional Battle: I hate the Heart of Sorrows. Strahd sort of *needs* it, especially with my party, but it's so easily destroyed. Even with some spawn in the room, it's nothing but a big ""crush me!!!"" item, and they will, causing Strahd to lose another combat-advantage. As much as I've whined about that, and people have given opinions on it, I *really* want Strahd to feel CR 16. I thought of spicing it up with a battle; they break the Heart, they find an Atropal inside. I really like the stat block, and they have so much Radiant damage output they still probably won't suffer too hard for it, but it could just LA-Wail every turn, tossing out Exhaustion levels, and Life Drain on its turn, to sort of tank damage. They are about the same level as one would expect for the campaign you are expected to fight one in, so that doesn't really worry me, and it fits, for me, protecting Strahd's ""healing"" power. Again, with all the radiant damage they can dish out, I think they could even kill it, but the problem is the exhaustion. As much as I like the idea of the rest of the castle getting a break from their weakened state, they might feel they *have* to leave, to recover those Exhaustion levels, and then have to agree to go back later. That might be bad, but if #1 is implemented, this becomes even worse, as they might *have* to stay in the castle, with 2+ levels of exhaustion under their belts. They could flee from it, and there'd be a roving Atropal in the castle, maybe even getting out, and drifting down to the towns below, or stand and fight; their call. Should I skip the fight, and just say ""yep, Strahd will be that much easier to beat"", or give them an option to have a really cool encounter? ToA doesn't feel bad about it, when they *can't* retreat, and death is permanent, so should CoS?

Because it makes me think. When I think I see flaws.  Bladesinger is my target right now.

Your expected to be in melee.  Even with high ac you have low hp *and your in melee*

Every time your hit you have to make a con save.  Starting at DC 10.  If your in blade song you can add your int modifier.  For me this would give me a total of +5 (2 from con and 3 from int)

So if I roll a 5 or less I fail.  Higher if I take over 20 damage.

This becomes a big problem at high level.  Average hp 6 per level.  6x15 is 90 hp.  If I get hit for 30 that's a DC 15 (probably a light hit too at 15).  That means I have to roll a10 or higher.

That haste /web or whatever super important spell is gonna get dropped that was saving the parties ass.

You essentially have to invest into resilient con and warcaster.  Getting proficiency with concentration and advantage.

Issue.

As a blade singer you need to max dex/int to stay relevant.  That means at best you have room for 1 feat.  Can't pick both. 

Pushing this further survival really depends on mobile feat.  Ability to remove someone's ability to attack you.  Dash through difficult terrain.  50ft movement during song. 

No way you have room for 3 feats.

So this means web/haste /even shadows blade *are trap options* unless you have much faith in your dice worship.

Question is can you make an effective non concentration bladesinger?

The DM texted each of us recently and asked us what we wanted for our characters.  As in, what are our intentions for further developing their personalities and desires as unique characters.  The DM is looking to provide us with opportunities throughout the quest to expand upon the lore from our backstories, and bring us through character arcs that will affect our PCs.

&amp;#x200B;

I love this kind of stuff, and have several character this would be perfect for, but with my half-orc, I'm having some trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory-wise, he's a half-orc that used to be in the army as a high ranking officer, but was medically discharged due to an injury that blinded him.  Because of the blow to his ego and the lack of a job, he fell from grace, eventually becoming homeless and hated by the community.  On the verge of death, he was taken in by monk, who nursed him back to health and taught him to take hold of his life and health through meditation and yadda yadda monk stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

After years, he left the monostary because of the cult activity in Horde of the Dragon Queen, deciding that now that he was 'healed' and ready to take action with his new skills, it was his duty to take up the mantle of a warrior once again and combat evil that threatened the land.

&amp;#x200B;

SO.  This guy has kind of already been through his defining character arc.  He's already hit rock bottom and has pulled himself up to a functioning state and is content.  He's also old for a half-orc.  Not quite elderly, but getting there.  I'd love to challenge his character but I'm not sure what kind of change I want him to go through.  I don't know what a realistic flaw to exploit for a disciplined, ex-soldier, now-monk would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I considered his old unit requesting for him to rejoin, which I think in a novel or short story would be great, but in a DnD game the threat of him going back isn't realistic since I would never actually have him leave the campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years, he left the monostary because of the cult activity in Horde of the Dragon Queen, deciding that now that he was &amp;#39;healed&amp;#39; and ready to take action with his new skills, it was his duty to take up the mantle of a warrior once again and combat evil that threatened the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO.  This guy has kind of already been through his defining character arc.  He&amp;#39;s already hit rock bottom and has pulled himself up to a functioning state and is content.  He&amp;#39;s also old for a half-orc.  Not quite elderly, but getting there.  I&amp;#39;d love to challenge his character but I&amp;#39;m not sure what kind of change I want him to go through.  I don&amp;#39;t know what a realistic flaw to exploit for a disciplined, ex-soldier, now-monk would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered his old unit requesting for him to rejoin, which I think in a novel or short story would be great, but in a DnD game the threat of him going back isn&amp;#39;t realistic since I would never actually have him leave the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just kind of hitting some writers block here, so looking for some ideas or advice from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

Also help on deciding between 3 classes.

Greetings all! I wanted to get some advice and ideas on a few things. Im going to roll a half elf who has obtained magical power through a deal with an archfey. I want this character (Khal Venrie) to be a cute cinnamonbun that needs protecting from the dangers of the world. I haven't really looked into fey stuff and so i wouldnt know what would be appropiate in terms of the backstory. What it boils down to is that Khal didnt really have any magic power in him to the dismay of his loving mother. Many of the kids would pick on him with their own magic and just be a step ahead of him in life. To be fair, Khal didn't really mind and was content in cheering on his friends and just having fun with other things essentially.

&amp;#x200B;

His mom however believed that he desperately needed to gain some sort of magical essence in order to protect himself and be happy. And so she made a deal with an archfey entity and got to the agreement that once Khal reached a certain age (20) she would come with this entity to the feywild to act as a servant for the rest of her days in exchange for ""Protection"" in the form of the unearthing of the innate magical abilities that was burried deep inside him as well as just keeping a loose eye on him over his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Khal wasnt okay with losing his mother but knew better than to challenge an archfey thanks to the tales he grew up with. After a tearful goodbye, He set out immediately to find a way to free his mother from this deal wether it be through some sort of trade that would please this Archfey lord or just becoming strong enough to free her himself.

&amp;#x200B;

This is basically the backstory for my character, i will be fleshing it out more obviously but i wanted to ask if these seems like an okay interaction between a mortal and an archfey lord? Khal's mother is a very powerful witch so it's not like she is a random peasant so it would make sense that the archfey would be okay with this ""trade"". Any lore on the archfey to keep in mind would also be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

The other part of my question would be what class would make the most sense for Khal to be?  
I have 3 possible choices in mind:  
A) Wild Magic Sorcerer- One of the possible origins that the Book recommends is in fact being blessed by a fey creature which would fit the bill quite nicely.

B) Fey Origin Sorcerer- Homebrew Sorcerer Origin from [dmsguild](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/250669/Four-new-Sorcerer-Origins). This one im the most on the fence about since it's kind of less of a blessing  and more of innate Fey powers. It still mixes nicely with the fey aspects of my character's powers and i can just reflavor stuff to better suit me.

C) Archfey Warlock- While This character didn't willingly go into this pact with this entity, i think that the bonuses and abilities obtained through it might work out rather well with the roleplay.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again thank you very much for helping out in any way you can.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Need help on how Archfey react to mortal deals and how they would look after one as part of this deal. Also help on deciding between 3 classes.&lt;/p&gt;

made in light of the new [Artificer's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#Alchemist) Homunculus. I am using the PHB Ranger after it has been updated with all the errata.

- Your beast companion has not 4 but 6 times your Ranger level in hp

- You can add your proficiency bonus to any ability saving throw the beast makes (in addition to AC, damage,  and attack rolls)

-  If the Beast has multiattack, it doesn't anymore. (ninja edit: it regains it at 11th level Ranger with Bestial Fury!)

- Certain CR 1/2 creatures, like the Ape and the Black Bear are acceptable options.

- While bonding to a new companion still takes 8 hours and requires the beast to be non-hostile, you can also resurrect your beast by spending 1 hour within 5 feet of its body and expending a 1st level spell slot to resurrect it, bringing it back with 1 HP. (this is the one I want most discussion on - should I allow resurrection without the body? I'm pretty happy with the lack of a GP cost and use of a spell slot at the moment)

- Regardless of the stat block, your beast has a pool of d10 hit dice equal to your Ranger level, which it can expend during a short rest per the Errata.

- In addition to the Ranger's Companion ability, you gain the benefits of Exceptional Training at 3rd level, however it doesn't grant the ability to overcome resistances and immunity to damage.

- At 7th level, you gain the following ability:

&gt; **Superior Beast Defense:** When your beast is forced to make a saving throw, it has advantage on the saving throw as long as you are within 30 feet of it. In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical weapons.

- Lastly, whenever you gain an ASI from the Ranger class, your Beast receives one as well. Your DM may permit your beast to take feats, such as Savage Attacker or Athlete. Of course, certain feats can become available in the correct circumstances; such as an Ape taking Weapon Master to how use a hammer or sword, or an Awakened Owl taking the Linguist feat.

The problem of have for artificer is that it’s base class feels incomplete. Yes it has cantrips and rituals but you traded martial weapon, heavy armor, and fighting style, if you compare to other half casters paladin and rangers. Infused items have only 5 unique things and the other option is to replicate a magic item. I feel it is lacking because you could get armor or weapon that is +1 or +2 or pick up a magic item. The armor of resistance can be replace with ring of resistance, the pouch is a better version of bag of holding when its with small items. The returning is nice but you have to remember is that the throwing weapons don’t have the support, the thing I did was using darts. The get tool proficiency 

I feel the artificer should had gotten a little bit more maybe expertise on knowledge (or any skill) since they are seeker of lore. Maybe give them three skills instead of two. Or maybe give them a fighting style to boost how they fight (god I would love twf). Maybe some more unique spells that could be focused on your weapon(s),  maybe another buff, or maybe one we haven’t seen yet. The subclass adds nice support or dmg output but I feel the subclass should not define the class. 

What do you guys recommend.

Tl;dr artificer rant about not feeling unique enough probably because of lack of options. I feel the builds would focus on dex/int because it feels focused on crossbows though you could have a good budget build with strength after 12th with gauntlet of orge power/ belt of hill giant strength. The subclass helps build a bridge but feels shaky as a class and could use some help.

With his 5 to strength mod, and a plus 3 from the jumping rules he can jump as far as 8 feet, normally. He asked if that could give him advantage on his two melee attacks on the downward crashing arc. I was intrigued by this, and decided on the ruling:  


Any attack while coming down from 10+ feet height, assuming the enemy is standing at 0 ft will grant you advantage on your attacks before you land. Any creature size above large will need a +10 to the falling height.

He jumps well past his previously mentioned 8 feet to 16 from the option that a player can jump beyond his or her total jump height if he or she passes an athletics check. He gets a +10 to athletics from the prodigy feat.   


So every turn he's jumping into the enemy, slamming down with 20+ damage and forcing enemies prone without the need of superiority dice.

That's not my disconnect here.

&amp;#x200B;

I was recenty invited to play in a new group by a friend/more of an acquaintence of mine.  He's the only person I know in the group.  The DM and other two players are strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

Session 0 went well.  Gonna have to adjust to a new group's playstyle, but that's fine.  My worries stem from the answer to a question I asked at the end of the session: ""How forgiving will this quest be, should I invest in a miniature for my dude, or is there a good chance he'll die pretty early on?""

&amp;#x200B;

To this, the DM responded with (paraphrased) ""It'll be a chill quest, but I have it set up as a bunch of viniettes about different groups of adventurers, so every 4 levels or so, an arc will end and you guys will roll up brand new characters, picking up at the level your previous characters left of.  Your previous characters might show up as NPCs/ the subject of stories or legends.  I wouldn't get a miniature cuz you won't be playing any one character for very long.""

&amp;#x200B;

This was a huge red flag for me, not because of player or character behavior or attitudes, etc, but simply because I think it totally goes against the whole point of developing a character (mechanically and personality wise).  It's a problem for me personally because I know I'll have a hard time being invested in a character if their stats, items, connections to NPCs, and character development aren't going to matter in 6-8 sessions.  Not to mention any work I might do on a backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is even more problematic for one of the other players at the table, a guy who has never played before.  Learning the game from scratch is already a long arduous, sometimes intimidating endeavor, especially trying to master casting classes.  Not only is this player going to have to learn an entirely new class and their mechanics every arc, they will be trying to learn a new class starting at a higher level each time.  Imagine having never played a warlock and then trying to learn the basic mechanics, pact magic, pick a pact, pact boon, and innvocations for an 8th level character, when you barely know the game at all.  Even a fighter is gonna give a new player some trouble all their abilities at once.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I feel likeI should voice my concerns, BUT with me being completely new to this group of people, I'm second guessing myself a little, maybe I'm overreacting, maybe I put too much value into individual characters- this might be a good chance to experiement with classes I don't usually play or multiclassing, etc.  MY QUESTION(s) TO YOU GOOD FOLKS HERE ON REDDIT:

Under these circumstances, would you have the same worries?  Is it a problem worth voicing my concerns over?  Has anyone else played a campaign like this?  How did it go?

&amp;#x200B;

If this setup is something that will hinder the game in the long run, I have no problem voicing that.  Communicaion is key.  I just don't want to shoot down a new DMs first homebrew campaign idea if it's really a non-issue, especially being 'the new guy.'  But if the campaign falls apart because the new guy is too confused and looses interest and the rest of us don't care about our characters, I don't wanna be like ""well I COULDA warned you this might happen... but I didn't! :D""

I run a weekly game at my local shop and my players just defeated Marlos Urnrayle and the (nerfed) stone golem in the Temple of the Black Earth. However, two of my players were turned to stone by Marlos’ Stone Gaze and the party made a deal with his lieutenant to leave the Temple if he returned my players to flesh (I know that’s not how it works but we house ruled it some with Wish and the Earth Genasi). 

My question is should I count the cult as defeated and run the encounters the book describes, count the cult as not defeated and wait for my players to knock someone else out, or run the encounters and keep the Earth cult on the table still? My thought is that they don’t have Ironfang so they can’t do some of the Fane or Elemental Caves stuff without that; but the book says “when they’ve killed the prophet and the monster in B23, the cult is done”. So going strictly by the book, they’ve done what they needed to. My gut says to start retaliating with the Earth Cult still around though. 

The party is headed back to town for rest and to maybe get some new weaponry but I want them to start to feel less safe on the road “home”. I’m thinking of a Retaliation encounter and/or a devastation orb but I’m not sure how much is too much or if I’m overthinking this whole thing.

I've already done quite a bit of scouring the net in search of an answer, which seems to be somewhere between **Cr=level\*25%** for PCs not optimized for battle, to **CR=level\*75%** for optimized PCs, with **higher concentration around 50-66% mark.**

1. CR=level for NPCs with directly war-like classes (fighters, war mages, rangers)
2. CR=level\*50% for NPCs with classes that are useful in, but not concentrated on warfare (rogues, warriors, clerics)
3. CR=level\*25% for NPCs with classes not useful in warfare (commoners, experts, nobles)

Therion, Ario, Haaylen, Octavia, and Kraeft, if you're here please don't continue reading.

For mostly humor related reasons, our wizard has an owl familiar that takes the form of a chicken. The group is certainly looking for a certain goblin-infested castle in the area, and one of my group is suggesting that the wizard simply sends his familiar up 500-600 feet, where his literal birds-eye view would be able to see any ruins, clearings, etc, potentially saving the party a few day's travel to Thundertree to talk to the druid. I fully encourage using the familiar for short-haul dungeon exploring, as the wizard can just use telecommunication up to 100 ft. This sort of hours-long exploration covering an area encompassing a few miles is a harder call. I've got a few days to think this over before our next session. 

Map for reference - party is starting from the village of Phandalin. https://i.imgur.com/RNdM4NM.jpg

In principle, I like the idea, but in application I am wondering how best to handle this. I'm thinking of having the familiar roll a Perception check for every hex explored at a medium DC, and maybe require having it fly closer to get a good look at what it sees, as at that height I assume even a broken down castle would blend in with the rest of the forest?

I'm also aware that natural predators are a thing, so I could do something like roll a d20 per hex explored - on a 17-20, a hawk or other bird of prey would take notice (similar to rolling random encounters on the road). I also am aware that familiars can't attack, so I feel like if I do successfully roll an encounter, it'll be a quick end to the tale of the chicken owl flying above a forest. Maybe that's needed for a touch of realism though. 

Are there limitations to what information the familiar can relate back to the wizard after a successful scouting trip, or other limitations of the familiar for this kind of application? I don't want to make this an overly hard task, because it's a creative use of the relatively limited resources the party has available to them. But I also don't want this to essentially be a dungeon bypass option, as there's a pretty important story tie-in at Thundertree.

I want to make Acid Splash a focus as the cantrip, since it fits thematically. In order to make it viable, It’s going to need a little juicing up (like how the Alchemist gets to add their Intelligence modifier to their Wand Prototype). I’m looking for ideas on how to scale this spell better without making it overpowered.  Here’s some ideas I had:

1. **Damage on save.** A big problem with Acid Splash is that the opponent does not take damage when they save. This feels bad, as a player. It’s less likely to happen to two enemies, but more like to miss at least one and do a measly d6 damage.
2. **Increase damage die.** A d6 is not exciting, even if you can try and tag it onto an extra creature. Larger damage dice could quickly make this spell more imposing. However, it could easily outscale other cantrips if we bump it straight to a d12.
3. **Advantage on damage dice.** Increase the average damage without getting the scaling out of hand.
4. **Add Intelligence modifier to damage dice.** This would scale a little more aggressively than most cantrips (e.g. Fire Bolt) since it can hit twice, but technically Wand Prototype would work just the same way for Acid Splash, so there’s probably no balance concern here.
5. **Just make an entirely new spell.** I'm open to this if it's easier and there's a creative way to make it work.

**QUESTIONS:** Do you have any other ideas? What about secondary effects beyond damage? Which of these do you like best? Is a combination best? What would you like to see combined? What should the top range of damage be? Is Eldritch Blast a good benchmark if we are making this cantrip the singular focus of the subclass?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of homebrewing a Brewer subclass for the Artificer.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey all. In an upcoming campaign, I'll be playing a former physician/biological madman. The setting is in a world where a magic catastrophe (players not privy to details yet) killed off many of the magic practitioners, resulting in in a sudden drop of ""active"" magic knowledge; magic, as a craft, is being rediscovered. But the catastrophe left magic items...just no one really knows how to make more. Through as-of-yet-to-be-determined-backstory-stuff, this fellow has decided to shift his attention from working on biology-related magics to artificing. Specifically, seeking ways to advance magic by using the ""already well-establish and complex systems of magical creature anatomy""; basically using the known complexity of biology to supplement and cut-corners in magic research.

&amp;nbsp;

I want him to start working towards crafting items like the Staff of the Adder and the Pot of Awakening, with the ultimate goal being creation of a Docent-like entity (a repository of magical knowledge that can learn and grow, dispense knowledge to others, and presumably survive a repeat of a similar catastrophe by virtue of being a non-living magical item).

&amp;nbsp;

But I'm also at a loss for intermediate steps. What might he work on between point-A (level 1, entering the craft) and point-Z (the docent)? **What magical items have some element of transmuting biology or bringing inanimate things to life (temporary or permanent)?** Any suggestions or ideas? All opinions are welcome! Obviously, I'll talk to my DM but I also want to consult the internet hivemind for ideas!

Due to a rather fatal end to my previous character I am rolling up a new one to switch to. Was thinking of trying out Celestial Warlock as the bonus healing dice are really appealing, coupled with reliable damage from Eldritch blast.

Was consdering choose half elf with following stats (STR - CHA): 8, 14, 16, 10, 12, 20. Racial and ASI bonuses are inlcuded already.

The dex and con are switchable but I figure the +1 to AC won't mean much if I go for mage armour anyway.

I am planning on picking pact of the tome for more spells and utility (plus ritual casting).

I'm slighlty overwhelmed by all the choice this gives me access to so would appreciate any suggestions of what to pick since I'm starting at level 10.

I will certainly be making use of Eldrictch blast -&gt; agonising blast with Hex (occasionally minus the latter if I have a good concentration spell I want up like Mire the Mind etc).

Would be great to hear what you guys think would be useful to pick. I know there are a lot of similar posts already but they generally seemed to be starting at lower levels (or multi-classing) so I wondered if the higher start I'm getting will change any picks.

For the record I will not be multi-classing as I'm still pretty new and don't want to get too mixed up (if I ever did it, my pick would be sorc unsurprisingly).

1. Illusory Reality: I had the pleasure of playing high-level illusionist. And *Illusory Reality* is a game changer. Unless your DM is going out of his way to nerf and check you constantly, this will be useful in and out of combat. In my humble opinion, this is the most powerful wizard-subclass feature of all.
2. Portent: I believe *Portent* will be on most people's lists. With legendary resistance, its potency is reduced. However, it's absolutely ridiculous even in high-levels (only experience is in one shots. sorry).
3. Arcane Ward: It's not as powerful as the first two but this is incredibly useful in combat. With the ability to recharge often, it's useful even in high-level. This one was hard to put here since abjurer is so powerful because the combination of all its useful features (ward+spell resistance+better Counterspell) makes the subclass powerful. But *Arcane Ward* is still amazing.
4. Spell Resistance: Resistance for spell saves and damage is huge especially for higher-level content with so many enemy spell casters (for many campaigns). 
5. Focused Conjuration: I was not too convinced with the conjurer but from watching my friend's Conjurer progress to high-level (We are level 18 atm), *Focused Conjuration* is amazing. There are so many amazing conjuration spells and so many instances where concentration on said spells not being broken from damage comes up as a clutch. Conjurer imho (no offense to the conjurers) is not very good until *Focused Conjuration*.

For the next game I was thinking about doing a tower-like dungeon crawl where the players will progress from one floor of the tower to another.  

&amp;nbsp;

However, there is one Gotcha, they won't be able to bring in **any** of their items into the tower. The rooms in the floor will comprise of both fighting monsters and puzzles, with the ""Boss Room"" being either a traditional final boss or a Complex Trap (as described in XGE).  

&amp;nbsp;

I know a lot of folks will have a question as to the why's, but the particular part of this that I need help with is how the players can go about obtaining equipment to use within the dungeon. Since the players aren't allowed to bring their equipment this also means they can't bring in their own weapons, armors, or tools. Obviously I could do things such as put in treasure rooms to grant them such items or place enemies that will drop them. However, I also wanted to offer a crafting option. In regards to the time crafting typically takes, I would just chalk it up to ""the magic of the tower accelerates your crafting"" so that players aren't stuck in the tower for days/weeks/years/eternity. The one problem I ran into with that is that, realistically, only one of my players has the necessary proficiency in tools to be able to make items. Even at that, all he could make would be Alchemic potions/solutions or herby-like items.  

&amp;nbsp;

So, there lies the question. How could I open up a quasi-crafting system in the tower so that players can make their own items without essentially giving them the items for free. At most the only thing I could come up with in a Forge of some sort where players could throw in battered items in return for raw materials and t hen turn around to use those raw matierals, or they could in turn throw the raw materials back in a certain combination and get back a finished item. E.G. toss a battered chain mail you looted from an enemy into the forge, and you get some ingots. Then you throw in some ingots with some wood, and you get back an axe, arrows, or some other finished product that comprises of the materials you threw in.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my players won&amp;#39;t be able to make it to our game night, so I decided to do somewhat of a one-off for the remaining players.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there lies the question. How could I open up a quasi-crafting system in the tower so that players can make their own items without essentially giving them the items for free. At most the only thing I could come up with in a Forge of some sort where players could throw in battered items in return for raw materials and t hen turn around to use those raw matierals, or they could in turn throw the raw materials back in a certain combination and get back a finished item. E.G. toss a battered chain mail you looted from an enemy into the forge, and you get some ingots. Then you throw in some ingots with some wood, and you get back an axe, arrows, or some other finished product that comprises of the materials you threw in.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

For various reasons I'm thinking of making the next session primarily Theatre of the Mind. One of the reasons is the 3rd dimension will be fairly critical to the area they are running in.

I'm going to use my typical 'playmat' materials to make a scaled version of the whole 'dungeon' - a river running through a canyon, and have them describe how they try to make it through the canyon and what happens using the 'model' to show landmarks etc rather than a scaled battleground.

Why- I want creative solutions and RoC to go through the canyon. There won't be clear trails to follow. In some spots it will be 'impossible' to move forward and I think putting the 'impossible' stuff drawn on to the map will cause more frustration than describing the fact that the river has widened and cut off the ability to walk, so now what do you do? You know what I mean?

&amp;#x200B;

Any hints for shifting a typically visual group into ToM? I think I can handle this, but I might wimp out and go back to the mat/drawing on the grid minis etc. Maybe in spots ill draw it out anyway.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Guys,&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to open a new thread on that issue, because I am currently desperately trying to figure out a cool new dungeon for a group of which I am the DM! I think I already went through every single thread which I could find here and with Google, but did not come up with a concept I like so far.

My campaign is mainly built around retrieving artefacts, which are needed to prevent the villain from doing some bad stuff (classic, I know). Every artefact is found at the end of a dungeon, and for the next one I chose the place of an underground abandoned city. No one can be found, the city is average size; when players walk around, they will find a small iron golem, who is blacksmithing and can communicate with them. He is quite friendly and tries to sell stuff. He complains about lack of business during the last time, acting like it is completely normal to be blacksmithing in a city in which he is the last... Moving thing. He seems to be created by his former master, who turns out to be the former blacksmith in town; this is revealed when players want to go into detail.

Now the part with which I need help: I need some kind of riddle or task which players have to fulfill which reveals the final position of the artefact. It can include encounters, but should not be the only element, as my group is quite into riddles (not like the classic rhymes or sphinx riddles, rather some investigation stuff or trial and error riddles). I already thought of plenty different scenarios: something like probably the last wishes from deceased people must me fulfilled, with who they communicate after the golem sold them an item for that purpose. Or an item on a fountain in the very middle of the city is obviously missing und must be put back.

I am normally quite good with that sort of creative stuff, but this time I am struggling quite a lot. Any suggestions?

I'm here to consult your great wisdom!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm beginning to DM a homebrew adventure and I want to make custom items for my characters based on their expectations to each one.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in 3.5e old times, I liked the concept of ""Legacy Items"" and ""Item Sets"" and I want your help to create something like that. For those not familiarized with these types of magic items, ""Legacy Items"" are powerful items that level up with characters and need a talent to up to the next tier, but despite being powerful, they gave some kind of debuff, like a -1 in something (in 3.5e is normally in a saving throw or skill, or even in an attack bonus). The talent sometimes accompanies a quest and some sort of ritual (I will use only the quest/ritual part and they will be mandatory). The ""Items Sets"" are the classical sets of many games, where having more than one item of the collection start to give you bonuses.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my first idea is to make ""armor sets of legacy"". Items with the capability to improve their quality (in terms of power and utility) and provide bonuses if you find more of the same collection. Simple, no? The players not necessarily will be able to get all of them neither unlock all the potential of the items. Because of this, I'm not concerned (at least not for now) if the whole thing is OP or some items are OP.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to ask your help with the first character I'm working on: a Wood Elf Ranger who want to use the Gloom Stalker/Assassin/Battle Master build. He inspired himself with the Bosmer race from Elder Scrolls and want to be the best hunter in the world and uses ambush tactics. He fights in long range with bows.

&amp;#x200B;

So I want your help to create all items in this concept. I will try to make at least one item for every slot (weapon, head, shoulder, armor, bracer/glove, ring, neck, boots, waist, some other misc item as a quiver, for example). The concept for these items, besides fit on the above build, is to have a heavy ""forest/animal"" theme and don't use wood as materials unless the wood is alive (the bosmer have a pact with a nature good that forbidden them to hurt any kind of plant life). The items maybe were created by their hunt god or even their creator god. You get the idea.

Hey guys, I made [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b46sti/about_to_start_our_last_session/) two days ago about the end of my campaign. I said that I would talk about it if there was interest. There was some interest and so now I am talking about it. I might to post this yesterday, but had some issues with the automod. I have another game to run in couple hours, but I'm happy to talk about anything until then.

I am happy to answer questions about the game, what I learned, my homebrew rules, or anything else! Some of the players will be here as well.

**The Game**

We were playing my own modified version of 5e. We started in November of 2017 and I think we had around 70 sessions. I used group XP. The game is a bit harder on the players, but nothing too brutal (the players may disagree). We used Matt Colville's [Warfare](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/) rules along with quite a bit of homebrew stuff from my end.

There were 6 players (one of them online with Roll20 and Skype), myself, and one player who only made the game when school wasn't going on.

**The Players**

We are all pretty inexperienced and I believe everyone but Paladin 1 is the only player who did not have a character die. Only one player has had two deaths. We started with six players, added two and lost one.

DM: I have the most experience with DnD 5e, but not much. I've DM a whole lot of one on one stuff with my girlfriend and one 1 to 11 roll20 game, but that's it.

Barbarian: Not sure how much experience he has with RPG's or 5e. He is the oldest character in terms of character life.

Wizard: The only player with no experience with RPG's. This was also his second character. His character is the second oldest. He was a necromancer who casted fireball a lot. He is the second oldest.

Warlock: My girlfriend the second most experienced . She was playing a fey warlock after her ranger died. She might be in the thread. She was only player who played online. Her character is the third oldest.

 

Bard: A lore bard who has been given some gifts from the God of Chaos. This was his second character after his warlock died. We played a few sessions together in a game ran by my girlfriend's dad. His character is the fourth oldest

Rogue: I don't know how much experience he has with 5e or RPG's. He played a swashbuckler (when he could make it) and had two characters die.

Paladin 1: This player joined last and is the only player to have no deaths. I believe he has the most experience. He played an Oath of the Ancients Paladin. He will be answering questions.

Paladin 2: This player join before the first paladin, but took a break for school. His had two characters before this one, but only one died. He was involved in the game with Bard, Girlfriend and myself. I don't know how much experience he has.

**The Story**

The general story was that a divide between a group of orcs. Some were following a servant of Orcus while others were following the true orc gods. This divide happened after all of the orcs invaded the humans. The party were placed in a three way war and had to pick sides. They ended up fighting with the humans and ""good"" orcs. While this made the fight easier, orcs now are in a position of power in the land. There were other smaller plots, but that was the main arch. The story started as the backdrop for levels 1-5 and then became the main focus. The end of the game saw Orcus killed in this lair along with my own version of the Raven Queen being freed from her prison inside one of the players weapons.

**Things I liked**

One things I really liked about the game was that I was able to avoided any fudging. I find the game less fun if I fudge things, so I tried really hard to avoid it. The closest I came was making a few favorable ruling at a good time and changing a homebrew monsters on the fly if after I saw them in action.

I also liked and encourage all DMs to do this, make the players choice matter. There are quite a few consequences of this game that will effect my other games going forward. I felt like the world changed based on the players.

 

**Things I learned**

Having too many players is better than not enough. I think we missed two to eight sessions total. This was mainly because if a few players couldn't make it, we could still play. I think it is best to have 5-6.

While having a player ""call in"" is tough, it is doable. I've been on the wrong side of that situation and it didn't work well at all, but if you are able to spend enough time (and like $30) you can get an okay set-up.

It is okay to take a break. There was a time where I wanted to take a break so that a critical session would line up with a school break so everyone could be there. One thing I did was have another player DM a mini campaign for a few weeks. I was afraid this would cause people to be less interested, but that didn't happen. There was also a time I had to take a break mid session after something crazy happened. It felt weird to do, but it worked out okay.

From a game design point of view, I found the end game monster to be fine, but that there very few rules and situations that challenged the players in non combat ways. In the lower levels you can use things like money, food/water, and distance to put the placers in difficult situations. The only thing like that I found for higher level play were different planes of existence, but even that was not perfect.

**Lastly, here is an art piece I got commission for the the game. I hope you enjoy!**

I said that I would talk about it if there was interest. There was some interest and so now I am talking about it. I might to post this yesterday, but had some issues with the automod. I have another game to run in couple hours, but I&amp;#39;m happy to talk about anything until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to answer questions about the game, what I learned, my homebrew rules, or anything else! Some of the players will be here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were playing my own modified version of 5e. We started in November of 2017 and I think we had around 70 sessions. I used group XP. The game is a bit harder on the players, but nothing too brutal (the players may disagree). We used Matt Colville&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/""&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; rules along with quite a bit of homebrew stuff from my end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 6 players (one of them online with Roll20 and Skype), myself, and one player who only made the game when school wasn&amp;#39;t going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I get it, I don't agree with it on concept, but I get it. That's not the issue I'm addressing with this post, however.

&amp;#x200B;

So, usually with regards to the eberron races the thing I usually see talked to death is warforged AC and the like. However I want to point out two things that kind of worry me with regards to A. playing a character who exists in Eberron, and B. future subrace/race design for Wizards going forward. And those two things are that the Swiftstride Shifter and Kalashtar both share a racial trait that is either nearly exactly the same, or objectively better than the class features of Scout Rogue and GoO Warlock, respectively. To compare them directly:  


Shifter trait:  Whiled shifted, (walking speed increase), Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Scout Rogue 3rd level feature: You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, the features are nearly identical, with the Scout rogue's being slightly better in that it is half your speed rather than a flat 10 feet. It also does not have the requirement of being shifted. My biggest issue with this one is it puts you in a very difficult spot if you want to play a shifter rogue. The Swiftstride Shifter is the one that gets +2 to dex, something very desirable for a rogue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Khalastar Racial Trait: (Mind Link) You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 ft of you. You dont' need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself. As a bonus action when you're speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and be able to see you.

&amp;#x200B;

GoO Warlock Feature: (Awakened Mind) You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. 

&amp;#x200B;

This one is the biggest offender and also the saddest if you're a warlock. Not only does the Khalastar ability have double the possible range, it has the added ""Or if the creature is telepathic itself"" for understand, AND as a bonus action the creature can respond to you, unlike the Warlock option where it would be impossible for the creature to respond. I understand that there are flavor differences between the two abilities but it's a really big discrepancy. It becomes rather limiting in an un-fun way when the combination of class/race that you want to play has overlapping abilities, or even when your class ability is overshadowed by a racial one. I'm worried that in future prints and designs we'll see more either improved or watered down versions of class abilities that creates too much overlap with no alternatives. I'm not sure if the better solution would be to offer some alternatives if you already have a similar class feature ( like with background profiencies?) or to alter them hugely.

tl:dr: let me play my furry scout rogue without feeling bad, also buff solo class warlock","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get this out of the way: yes I understand Eberron is supposed to be &amp;quot;higher magic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stronger&amp;quot; than other dnd settings so the racials should be &amp;quot;stronger.&amp;quot; I get it, I don&amp;#39;t agree with it on concept, but I get it. That&amp;#39;s not the issue I&amp;#39;m addressing with this post, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, usually with regards to the eberron races the thing I usually see talked to death is warforged AC and the like. However I want to point out two things that kind of worry me with regards to A. playing a character who exists in Eberron, and B. future subrace/race design for Wizards going forward. And those two things are that the Swiftstride Shifter and Kalashtar both share a racial trait that is either nearly exactly the same, or objectively better than the class features of Scout Rogue and GoO Warlock, respectively. To compare them directly:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifter trait:  Whiled shifted, (walking speed increase), Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn&amp;#39;t provoke opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scout Rogue 3rd level feature: You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn&amp;#39;t provoke opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the features are nearly identical, with the Scout rogue&amp;#39;s being slightly better in that it is half your speed rather than a flat 10 feet. It also does not have the requirement of being shifted. My biggest issue with this one is it puts you in a very difficult spot if you want to play a shifter rogue. The Swiftstride Shifter is the one that gets +2 to dex, something very desirable for a rogue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalastar Racial Trait: (Mind Link) You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 ft of you. You dont&amp;#39; need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself. As a bonus action when you&amp;#39;re speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and be able to see you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoO Warlock Feature: (Awakened Mind) You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don&amp;#39;t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is the biggest offender and also the saddest if you&amp;#39;re a warlock. Not only does the Khalastar ability have double the possible range, it has the added &amp;quot;Or if the creature is telepathic itself&amp;quot; for understand, AND as a bonus action the creature can respond to you, unlike the Warlock option where it would be impossible for the creature to respond. I understand that there are flavor differences between the two abilities but it&amp;#39;s a really big discrepancy. It becomes rather limiting in an un-fun way when the combination of class/race that you want to play has overlapping abilities, or even when your class ability is overshadowed by a racial one. I&amp;#39;m worried that in future prints and designs we&amp;#39;ll see more either improved or watered down versions of class abilities that creates too much overlap with no alternatives. I&amp;#39;m not sure if the better solution would be to offer some alternatives if you already have a similar class feature ( like with background profiencies?) or to alter them hugely. They both feel strong flavor wise for the races, but the repeated nature of them doesn&amp;#39;t sit right with me. Obviously Wgte is still in development phase so this may change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

obviously my CHA is my dumpstat right now but I have some idea or hope my DM might be able to hear me out because I'm a newbie player and wasn't quite aware of what I was doing when I started and always kind of had this build in mind. SO! my question is this: Should I bother with going into Warlock if I can manage to convince my DM to switch my INT to my CHA? I'm not playing to be super OP but I would like to remain formidable and be able to attack a whole bunch / defend my party. Going into Warlock would definitely fit into the story line as well as going Hexblade since I just 'found' a +2 nightmare glaive that could introduce me into the class further. I have a hard time though understanding how this will go long term or if it will severely stunt me by the time I get to higher levels.  I want to get to fighter Level 6 at least for my next feat

&amp;#x200B;

I guess there is a few options: To just 'dip' into level 1 warlock, or would it be a good idea to take more levels in it? Should I even bother? With Hexblade you get a few cool things: Baleful curse which increases critical hit range. It also gets me Hex as a spell, and Eldritch blast cantrip as well as green flame blade cantrip. I was pretty unimpressed by the wizards spell lists honestly

or will I be severely weakened by 20th level by dipping? So far DM has us planned to Level 10, but we've all discussed getting to level 20 and were probably going to be going up against a necrotic black dragon as our final boss battle (wooohooo).  The next feats I'm hoping to go for are War Caster and Charger. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the chance my DM doesn't let me swap my CHA mod with my INT (which I would totally understand) would it still be a good idea or not? Thanks for helping a newbie out here!

My question is this: Does Arcane Armament let you make a nonmagical attack with a magical weapon twice?

I am a DM running a game where one  of the players is playing a revised artificer. We have both read the Arcane Armament feature thoroughly and discussed what its definition is. I say that it only affects magical attacks from magical weapons, and he says it affects all attacks from magical weapons. My logic is that if, say, a battleaxe with the power to cast a single ray of scorching ray was found, the artificer could make one battleaxe attack, two scorching ray attacks, or one of each. He would not be able to make two battleaxe attacks. My player believes otherwise.

Here is a handy chart to compare:

Artifact gauntlet- has 3 charges, 1 charge fires a beam for 2d6 force damage.Both of us agree that an artificer can make two attacks with this weapon.

Flaming Battleaxe- has no charges, instead passively deals 1d4 fire damage with every hitI say that an artificer cannot make two attacks with this weapon. He says it can.

Hi there.

About to start a new campaign with a new character and I decided to mix it up and surprise my DM by turning my backstory into a little radio play.

The character is a Drow Bard who is an exile from Drow society.

Was just hoping to get some feedback, just on where anything can by improved.

My equipment isn't the best, and I don't have all the skills with editing, but I gave it my best shot so please keep that in mind.

Here's the backstory: https://youtu.be/l2bcLFykKuk 

Quick notes on the art:
Firstly, I thought about changing the image every minute or so, but the focus is on the audio and I didn't want to be inconsistant with the setting, so I decided against it.

Secondly, I did indeed just rip this from google images, and I intend for this to be privately used and all, but for the sake of crediting the artist, I got it here:

It can be for mechanical, RP, or a mix of both.

It can be for low level or high level.

For me, I have two favorites:

1. Diviner: we ALL love portent. It's simple but it's mechanically effective and it's amazing in RP. Mechanically, this has to be my favorite subclass...of all wizards and beyond lol. 
2. conjurer: RP-wise, it's my favorite since I've always loved wizards that conjure up creatures and fireballs from the sky. It actually feels like I'm playing some battlemage also as I summon and teleport around (it's not THAT good of a summoner until level 10 IMHO though). After level 10, that *focused Conjuration is* absolutely fantastic. IMHO, *focused conjuration* really boosts up conjurer's mechanical prowess from a lesser wizard school to one of the better schools (going to put diviner, illusionist, abjurer, and possibly war wizard above...with the first three significantly better imo). 

What are yours? Again, your reasons can be for mechanical, rp, or a mixture of both. It's your preference.

My party will encounter him as a companion for maybe half a session, and I need to set him up as someone they might want help from. For this I'm thinking I need to know a few of his higher level spells well enough.

The reason I want it to be quick start is because I know wizards can end up with a lot of spells and abilities and I don't want to spend hours putting a lvX character sheet together, as it will start to feel like my own PC and may end up feeling like the dreaded GMPC. Also a waste of time if the players completely derail the session to a point where they don't meet him!

My party is a Glamour Bard, Moon Druid, and Conquest Paladin. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next level I plan on taking wizard to pick up booming blade, create bonfire, find familiar and shield along with utility rituals. At level 5 I plan on taking fighter to get shield proficiency and defense fighting style. So at level 5 I will have an AC of 20 (technically 21 since I have masterwork studded leather) and be able to turn 1 ignite my bonfire in an area the paladin and I are going to control. The remaining turns I booming blade with advantage from my familiar to help me hit since I'm only making 1 attack per round then try to either force the enemy to move closer to me to activate booming blade or enter my bonfire to attack either the paladin or I. So in a perfect world where my bonfire hits I'm doing 2d8 from the rapier hit, 2d6 sneak attack, 2d8 for activating booming blade, and 2d8 from bonfire for 6d8+2d6+5. Since triggering both booming blade and bonfire may be difficult lets assume its only 4d8+2d6+5 for an average of 29-31 damage. The normal level 5 swashbuckler dual wielding gets 2d8+3d6+10 damage for 30-32 damage assuming both hit.

So while not sacrificing damage to any notable extent I will have a higher AC (18 for the typical level 5 swashbuckler with dual wielder feat), have the utility of detect magic, identify, and other spells, and can have much more fun in combat trying to move people around with my shield master paladin to trigger BB or push them into the bonfire. Additionally, if the tactic of bonfire and BB both hit I'm doing significantly more damage than the vanilla swashbuckler.

Am i missing an obviously better option? The other feasible choices are a hexblade 1 instead of 1wizard/1 fighter to grant a lot of the same benefits but I think its slightly less optimal for what I'm looking for. I could also choose dueling fighting and increase my average dame to barely above the normal level 5 swashbuckler, but tanking with high AC, shield, and eventually uncanny dodge at level 6 is a bit more of a priority. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week we plan to meet at our regular location, but we won't start up the campaign again until the week after, if not later.

As the current DM of the group, I'm taking the time to try and figure out what to do about her character. We ended our last session right before a battle, and her barbarian was grappling another player in an attempt to prevent the combat (which broke out anyway). 

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Do I just pick right back up and remove her character wholesale, pretending she was never there? That doesn't seem right.

 \- Do I have the enemies they're fighting (a trio of night hags \[we're running an altered CoS\]) kill her barbarian during the battle? Maybe right at the beginning? But then who controls the barbarian until she dies? I'm also not sure making the PCs deal with this death both in *and* out of character is the best solution.

 \- Do I have her character leave the party? There's no real catalyst for such a thing, so it'd feel fake.

 \- Do I keep her barbarian traveling with the party until the end of the campaign? I'm not relishing controlling 2 NPCs \[they've got Esmeralda with them atm\] plus all the enemies and everyone else they interact with as well. Plus we don't have her character sheet, so I'd be guessing on almost everything.

I'm really not sure where to go with this. Any and all advice would be great.

Edit:

Wow, this is my most popular post on reddit by far. Which I suppose is both good and bad in this situation. Thank you to everyone that has expressed their thoughts, ideas, and, most especially, condolences.

I'll be reaching out to my group this weekend with some of the ideas y'all suggested, and giving them time to mull them over before we meet on Thursday and discuss them in person.

When I first joined reddit I had no idea how great of a community it was. This post has made me glad I came here to ask this question, and I'm thankful you've all given your responses with the gravitas and respect I think it deserved. 

From both me and my players, thank you again.


Edit2:
Met with my group tonight to play some board games and present some options suggested here. The general consensus is that while we'd all be fine with just dropping the campaign as a whole, our friend wouldn't want us to do that. As another party member put it, she'd think it was bullshit she died and bullshit that we stopped playing because of it.

Most of them were uncomfortable with the idea of eulogizing in character, but they also didn't want to pretend like nothing had happened. After another week to process, we decided to do what was probably the most popular suggestion here: skip the battle and narrate the afterwards, with the PC's character having died in the fray. If any characters want to comment on it they'll have a chance to do so, but otherwise we'll just move on.

==========

Magical Tinkering
At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic in objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, or other artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.

The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.

A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

=================

So, trying to come up with a master list of fun and innovative ways to really have fun with this ability. What are your thoughts? :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to start playtesting an artificer soon, and I want to really play around with the magical tinkering feature, listed below for your convenience. &lt;/p&gt;

It's just so fascinating and scary how both fragile and incredibly strong the brain/mind can be. So because of that I enjoy sprinkling them into parts of the games I DM. It's not every session or very often, just little bits of it to ad more ""life"" to the world. And considering all the terrifying shit in the DnD universe there has to be something, right? 

Next session my players are going to be going to a [castle on an island](https://pin.it/xjqjxq5ufhhait) surrounded by a large wall in a lake. They've already run into a small hunting party that was heading back to town with their kills. The hunters told the party about the area and how nobody really goes there anymore because there are howls and screams from animals that should not live in the type of climate their in. The player's interest in the areas is piqued. So here's what I'm planning. 

The castle is a caregiving and safe haven for elder druids that are in any stage of dementia and/or Alzheimer's. The area has been watched over by a clan of Wood Elves that...live in the woods. The local villages always give praise and all that to druids so they are always revered and protected, that's where this castle comes in. When the other Druids notice the signs they bring them to the castle so that they aren't a harm to themselves or others. 

With the illness they start to wild shape into animals on accident, sometimes they mess up the wild shape and turn into a goad that screeches like a hawk, or bear that acts like a cat, or whatever weird mixture of animals you can think of. And I know that's not how wild shape works but whatever. They also wild shape into animals that are higher than CR 1. Like an elephant, T-Rex, etc. And of course, they can also cast spells just to make it more interesting. 

The party will find out about one of the ""residents"" that knows where some great weapon that he stole from a god (...or demon lord...or something, that's still in the works) is hidden. With the power of magic I'm going to have them go inside the dudes mind à la [Psychonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonauts#Setting), [Inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception), [Being John Malkovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_John_Malkovich), [Total Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_(1990_film)#Plot), [The Butterfly Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect), [Paprika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(2006_film)#Plot), [Perfect Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Blue), [Roy: A Life Well Lived](https://youtu.be/szzVlQ653as?t=24), of course the [The Inner Light TNG episdoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inner_Light_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)), and a few books. And have them try to play through the experience of someone with dementia/Alzheimer's lives and thinks. I got that idea from this great short flash game called [Alz](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905). 

I'm going to give them random premade character sheets that are at varying levels and have them play through previous battles that the Druid and his adventuring party went through. Some of the character sheets will have things blacked out like class abilities, to hit and damage dice, etc to add confusion and frustration. The character sheets are different styles that I've found on this subreddit to further make things confusing and frustrating. Also through life experiences that they had with roleplaying aspects, like seeing their child, spouse, or family member but not being able to remember their face, name, the sound of their voice, or combinations of all three. Flashbacks to happy days and sad, etc. 

I have other mental illness ideas and I'd like to get get some more inspiration from what you guys have used in your games or want to use. 

So what do you all have?

And yes, my table is very ok with these types of topics being played out and discussed and are also ok with the frustrating acts of roleplaying. They're very into being made to feel something both in and out of the game. From actual crying to real life anger (not at me), and crying from happiness. 

And of course, my games aren't always serious e.g. a bear trap that is literally a trap that drops bears on you or being sent into an Orc cave to rescue a farmers kid who was taken but the kid turns out to be a baby goat, and stuff like that.

I converted some of their old characters in unfinished campaigns to LV 6 characters to make a sorta ""last ride"" adventure with them. I did this because one of my players is leaving for a couple of months and I wanted his last session to be a cool one.  
&amp;nbsp;


My players were a Dragonborn Paladin (the friend I mentioned earlier), a Dragonborn Barbarian and a Bard Monkey with Halfling stats. The PCs met in a tavern before Gnolls broke in and started attacking. During the fight the Paladin player is joking about hitting the Gnolls while he was actually trying to kill the Monkey (do keep in mind that he wasn't actually trying to hurt him). The Monkey player is being a good sport about it and even follows up the banter by acting scared in a comedic way.  
&amp;nbsp;

The encounter ends, players receive instructions from an NPC that they will sail to the Gnoll's hideout in the morning. The encounter left the Monkey Bard in pretty bad shape and the Barbarian says a couple of times that they should put him out of his misery but not actually doing it (his PC is LE). Paladin and Barbarian players start playing up the roleplay and animosity between them since they are a metallic and a chromatic dragonborn respectively. They start a brawl while the Monkey player tries to stop them by getting into the fray. They were having a ton of fun with this extremely cartoonish fight. They were failing to grapple each other, hitting each other with the Monkey, failing spell attacks in a ridiculously small space, Barbarian summons a moose, the whole package.  
&amp;nbsp;


So the Monkey downs the Paladin and I ask him if he is hitting to knock him unconscious but he says he is hitting to kill. I get weirded out by this but I am not one to just take my player's agency away so I let it happen. Paladin goes into negatives and starts the Death Saving throws.  
&amp;nbsp;

Barbarian player instructs his Moose animal companion to attack the downed Paladin and I ask him if he knows he is going to insta kill him with that. Barbarian player gets a really scared look on his face and corrects himself saying that he just wants to rough the Paladin around a little bit, not actually kill him. Monkey's turn comes up and he just straight up kills the Paladin and then downs the Barbarian before killing him and then looting their bodies.  
&amp;nbsp;

Paladin and Barbarian players aren't mad, just shocked. Monkey's player is super into it, telling us how his character has ""always been a motherfucker"" and that's something he would do. Monkey's player tells us if we want to reset before the fight or make new PCs but I didn't feel like going on to be honest. I think that D&amp;D isn't about winning as much as it is about having fun, and you can't have fun in a one-shot with dead characters.  
&amp;nbsp;

What left a really sour taste in my mouth is that this One-shot was specially about characters that the players were fond-of making a comeback, but now is going to be ""that session were a couple of up characters straight up died like a bitch"".  
&amp;nbsp;

In hindsight I probablly should've told the dragonborn players to knock-off the teasing of the Monkey but I don't think it was even about the teasing for him. The vibe he gave me was that he just wanted to kill their PCs because he found it hilarious.  
&amp;nbsp;

Am I right for being upset? Should I mention something to him or the other players? He hasn't been disruptive before and I don't want to blow this out of proportion, but I feel that it could become a problem if I don't address it. What should I do?

When a character dies (by failing three death saves or by any other mean), ask the player if he prefers to be crippled instead. Depending on the damage that killed him, he know has a permanent disability like a missing arm or a crooked leg. The character gets to still have a story going on, and now has a new motivation : getting over his wound.

""At 9th Level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.""

Point of contention seemed to revolve around whether or not a character stops moving at the end of their turn. I'm not opening that particular can of worms again, but in the course of reading through it all and checking out Sage Advice's [ruling](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2018/04/07/__trashed-14/) plus [Mike Mearls'](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/12/20/can-a-lv9-monk-use-unarmored-movement-to-run-non-stop-through-a-large-lake-without-falling/), rules seem pretty clear on it. RAW says no, but the book ain't the DM.

Honestly, monks naruto-running on stuff sounds neat, so I thought of a compromise and figured i might share it.

For starters: Ki is weird. It's not strictly magic per se, but it can produce similar effects. For example:

 * Give you fists of fury (Flurry of Blows)

 * make you harder to hit (Patient Defense)

 * go zoom (Step of the Wind)

 * catch arrows and throw em back (Deflect Missile)

 * fall from great height and land like cat (Slow Fall)

 * stun people (Stunning Strike)

 * punch ghosts (Ki-Empowered Strikes)

 * reroll saves (Diamond Soul)

 * be a sprint grandma (Timeless Body)

 * become ghost (Empty Body)

 * Instantly kill the Big Bad Final Boss (Quivering Palm)

 * stealth spells (Shadow Arts)

 * Conjure earth/wind/fire/water/ice/whatever like the Avatar (Elemental Disciplines)

 * fight better when drunk (anything in Drunken Master)

 * make an ordinary stick a +3 magic weapon (One with the Blade + Sharpen the Blade) 

 * Shoot tiny sun balls from your hands (Radiant Sun Bolt)

 * tank an ancient red dragon's full multiattack with 1 hit point and stay standing (Mastery of Death)

And that's just the stuff you spend Ki Points to do, i'm not counting the rest of the clearly supernatural things Monks can do.

Establishing that Ki is a mysterious force, we come, finally, to the point:

By 9th Level, most spellcasters have had access to spells like Spider Climb and Water Walk for several levels, and have just attained Fly. The key (ki) difference is that they have to expend their precious resources to accomplish any of these.

Following that logic, most of the Monk's supernatural abilities require Ki to perform, and walking on water or running vertically is definitely supernatural. 

Thus, if you, the DM, have a 9th level Monk in your party, who came to the session wearing their Hidden Leaf headband and a face full of hope, I propose the following:

Just have them use Step of the Wind to continue adhering to the wall/not sinking. Costs Ki to use, can't do it forever, uses their bonus action, makes sense. 

At least I think so anyway. A potentially easier solution to bringing about your epic Kingdom Hearts 2 running-across-flying-buildings final fight is to just give them magic flip-flops that let them do what they're trying to do.  Idk its your game do what you want &lt;3

(EDIT)

To clarify just in case, the problem with the ability is that it implies a Monk attempting to move up/across a vertical surface or over a body of liquid would fall/sink if they stopped moving, or at the end of their turn. 

Monks can move fast enough that in most cases this isn't really a huge problem, but I think if a monk wants to be spiderman or have an epic on-top-of-the-water fight, then that's awesome and I'm down, but I might ask them to use Step of the Wind as part of their movement to avoid falling or sinking, implying that their use of Ki is enabling them to continue sticking to walls/standing on water. 

If you as DM, or the DM at your table, would let the Monk do this for free, then that's wicked. I'm all about players being cool and doing cool stuff and I bet playing my ronin guy at your table would be rad as heck.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;tank an ancient red dragon&amp;#39;s full multiattack with 1 hit point and stay standing (Mastery of Death)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s just the stuff you spend Ki Points to do, i&amp;#39;m not counting the rest of the clearly supernatural things Monks can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing that Ki is a mysterious force, we come, finally, to the point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 9th Level, most spellcasters have had access to spells like Spider Climb and Water Walk for several levels, and have just attained Fly. The key (ki) difference is that they have to expend their precious resources to accomplish any of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that logic, most of the Monk&amp;#39;s supernatural abilities require Ki to perform, and walking on water or running vertically is definitely supernatural. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if you, the DM, have a 9th level Monk in your party, who came to the session wearing their Hidden Leaf headband and a face full of hope, I propose the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just have them use Step of the Wind to continue adhering to the wall/not sinking. Costs Ki to use, can&amp;#39;t do it forever, uses their bonus action, makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I think so anyway. A potentially easier solution to bringing about your epic Kingdom Hearts 2 running-across-flying-buildings final fight is to just give them magic flip-flops that let them do what they&amp;#39;re trying to do.  Idk its your game do what you want &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(EDIT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify just in case, the problem with the ability is that it implies a Monk attempting to move up/across a vertical surface or over a body of liquid would fall/sink if they stopped moving, or at the end of their turn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monks can move fast enough that in most cases this isn&amp;#39;t really a huge problem, but I think if a monk wants to be spiderman or have an epic on-top-of-the-water fight, then that&amp;#39;s awesome and I&amp;#39;m down, but I might ask them to use Step of the Wind as part of their movement to avoid falling or sinking, implying that their use of Ki is enabling them to continue sticking to walls/standing on water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you as DM, or the DM at your table, would let the Monk do this for free, then that&amp;#39;s wicked. I&amp;#39;m all about players being cool and doing cool stuff and I bet playing my ronin guy at your table would be rad as heck. My compromise was more for RAW sticklers like me.&lt;/p&gt;

Add: When an attack roll is made against you, you can use your reaction to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits.  When you make a saving throw,  you can use your reaction to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your saving throw, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it succeeds.

**Jack of All Saves**

Also at 3rd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any saving throw you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.  

**Why the changes**

Valor bards get shields where Swords don't.  But Swords can use BI to raise their AC for a round.  So Swords can regularly have better AC than valor.  The AC change let's valor get the best AC but only against individual attacks - so they are the toughest bards.

The half proficiency to saves and ability to use a BI on a save makes the valor bard tougher and also makes them much better at maintaining concentration.  Since many bard spells use concentration, this is a big deal.  

So swords is better at melee, lore is better at casting spells, and valor is better at maintaining spells.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Inspiration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add: When an attack roll is made against you, you can use your reaction to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits.  When you make a saving throw,  you can use your reaction to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your saving throw, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jack of All Saves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also at 3rd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any saving throw you make that doesn&amp;#39;t already include your proficiency bonus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am in search of fellow theory crafters.  Crafting new characters and backgrounds is one of my favorite parts of DnD.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, I have found great value in Dexterity.  It should be noted that I played a Rogue and a Wizard.

&amp;#x200B;

I have enjoyed making builds for other classes, and always had a hard time getting away from a high initiative, or whatever your obsession with Dexterity may originate from.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I tried my hardest to simply ""find a viable strength build""  where I don't have to get crazy unrealistic ""god rolls"" on a character sheet in order to make the character build viable.

&amp;#x200B;

So here it is.  My Paladin.  As I share this character with you all, I am no longer a special snowflake.  If this build becomes popular, it will be bittersweet.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, we're not playing Lawful Stupid, or Deus Vult, or ""Morality Police"" of the group.  Get a backstory.  Make it interesting.  Further still, choose a Deity.  Choose one of the neutral gods, so you have good reason to be morally gray?

&amp;#x200B;

This Character builds attempts to maximize the use of our Bonus Action, Reaction, Opportunity Attacks, and effectively make the most out of our turn economy.  (I used to be a rogue, so it's very hard for me to let go of Cunning Action).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that Great Weapon Master is the greatest Feat in the game.

\-From a thematic perspective, I have never appreciated dual wielding.  not lightsabers, maybe daggers, maybe the one sword, one dagger.   I just find it more badass to be wielding something 2 handed.  even if it's a longsword + shield character and you use the versatile feat with the longsword, I think that's badass!  

\-Anyways... Great Weapon Master let's you wield a Greatsword, the coolest weapon in the game.  (ask DM to use D12 instead of 2D6's.... if you want.  basically for looks.  D12's are much prettier, and have faster rate of play!).

&amp;#x200B;

\-You will always be doing a strong attack, with the ability granted by the GWM feat to -5 to hit for a +10 DMG.   think I'm joking?  nope... you will always strong attack.  

&amp;#x200B;

\-This solves a major complaint that many people have about the paladin, being ""can't kill hordes"".  watch me.

&amp;#x200B;

By this time a lot of you are saying ""Ok this guy is dumb, he just wants me to hit things hard? wow"".  But hear me out!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Paladin: Oath of Devotion.  The lvl 3 ability makes our weapon magical for  1 Minute (a full combat encounter?) and adds our Charisma to the attack roll.  also shedding light and cool shit, because Paladin.  Hopefully we have a decent charisma, because this is gold, Jerry!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Defense for the +1 AC or go GWF to reroll 1's and 2's.   but remember.... our dmg is already coming from the huge +10 chunks!  Choose whatever you want.  of these two.  and only these two.  Baka\~

&amp;#x200B;

""But can't I do all of this as a fighter, without having to worry about all of that Deity stuff?""

\-Short answer?  Shame on you!  a pox upon your house!

\-Longer Answer?  Will you happen to have a cleric in your party that can be guaranteed to always have Bless on you?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Brothers, Sisters, don't fucking stop using Bless.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If I have stats with 18 STR and 18 CHA  (Lucky, but not impossible.  a lot of DM's let you roll until you find a stat combination you enjoy.  

\-using sacred weapon, I have +8 to hit, + proficiency bonus.

\-include Bless to get an additional 1-4 to hit.

&amp;#x200B;

If you get to this point, you're looking at a minimum bonus to hit of +11.  I would say that it's now prudent to use the -5 to hit for a +10 to damage.

\-This helps you proc the ""when you take an enemy down to 0HP you can make a single attack as a Bonus Action"".

&amp;#x200B;

As this character progresses, give them the sentinel feat, and plant them right in the action.  you now have increased use of your reactions and opportunity attacks.  greater turn economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you are truly concerned about your mobility and being able to ""get to the fight"", I did originally create this character to be a Tabaxi.  Brothers, Sisters, you will need to truly be fearless to play a tabaxi amongst our nerd brethren who call any Tabaxi a Furry. 

&amp;#x200B;

but the Tabaxi double movement ability could synergize very well with this paladin, especially if you are able to use Sentinel.  tabaxi run up to 3 NPC's who didn't think you'd be that fast... if they try to run away, sentinel feat one of them, hopefully the biggest baddy of the group.  then spend your following turn attacking them.  but don't move!  you don't have to.  aaaaand now you have recharged your feline agility or whatever it's called.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is a Strength Character that will have greater AC that Dex characters.... unless you count Wizards as Dex characters....

&amp;#x200B;

Wizards have the highest possible AC.  with:

\-Base of 15 with 20 Dex

\-Archmagi robes for 15+Dex

\-Bracers of Defense for +2AC

\-Ring of Protection for +1AC

\-Cloak of Protection for +1AC

&amp;#x200B;

for a total of 24 AC.  Also, if it's a level 18 Wizard, then they can permanently use Shield for free, for an added +5AC at the cost of their reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

but just comparing STR vs DEX, strength actually has the advantage.  hopefully you don't drown in your armor.  (oh hey that's part of my characters tragic backstory... nooo....)

&amp;#x200B;

Strength has higher DMG that Dexterity.  this where GWM really separates itself from Sharpshooter.  If sharpshooter let me attack another target on kill or crit, then I would say dexterity is better.  but this one Feat, really shows where the designers put their foot in the ground for what melee fighters risk by being in the fray.

&amp;#x200B;

my solid +10 dmg chunks from GWM are better than your sneak attack dice.  and I'm doing multiple attacks a around!  possibly 4 attacks in one full round of combat!  hahaha, ohhh rogues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Strength has higher AC, higher DMG, at the loss of not being able to sneak around or pickpocket?  hahahahahhahahahaha.  child's play.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this message has changed some minds about Strength.  It has been taxing to write this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello DnD crew!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a tool to automate damage calculations for large number of creatures. 
You give the target AC, number of creatures attacking, and attack statistics, 
it returns the damage dealt to the target by rolling the dice. You can also select an
SRD monster's attack or an ""Animate Objects"" object size so fields can be filled automatically.
That SRD monster selection box allows for searching so no need to scroll all the way down to find 
your monster.

Your damage description can be more complex than a simple ""XdY"". 
The format is explained [here](https://github.com/oganm/diceSyntax/blob/master/README.md).
For instance, if your enemies have great weapon fighting, you can do something like ""2d6ro&lt;2"".

It supports up to 1000 creatures. If you really need more than that send your PCs my regards.
If you are an R user, it's trivial to install it locally and remove that limitation.
I can help out if needed.

In the future I might return an average damage for massive mob sizes since randomness start 
mattering less and less as the number goes up. I also want to make it possible for everyone 
to install it on their own machines easily but my previous way of doing so hasn't been working
very well and I never had the time to fix that.

Honestly I'm surprised I couldn't find something like this out there. 
The closest were [this](http://onebitcpu.mygamesonline.org/animateobject.html)
by /u/onebitcpu specifically for animate objects and [this](http://slyflourish.com/mob_calculator.html)
that returns an average damage.

**Why this?** I like the idea of having large number of weaker creatures in D&amp;D. Action economy and
bounded accuracy means even low level enemies can stay dangerous in large numbers. Having large
number of enemies is a good way to challenge certain PCs (eg. weapon attack focused characters)
and forcing them to make strategic choices about PC placement, reaction use potentially using things
like skill checks to control the battlefield instead of regular attacks. Remind them those muscles
are also good for knocking rocks on a pathway. Any AOE focused
character will have a field day but they will also more be vulnerable since their AC probably doesn't scale as well as the fighter's and they can get overwhelmed easily. Forcing them to rely on their friends for protection and choose between dealing damage or battlefield control.

**Why not use a variant rule or an average?** Ultimately randomness is
part of the rules. If you know how much damage you take when the enemy acts in a certain way,
it removes part of the game that normally makes decision making more interesting/stressful. Randomness and
knowing the number of hits and misses also give more opportunities for narrative diversification. For
a PC it is satisfying/frustrating to know how well their defensive measures worked out. Also I feel like most DMs don't bother with calculating an average anyway. It is still more math than having a big dude on the field.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://oganm.com/shiny/swarm/""&gt;https://oganm.com/shiny/swarm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

number of enemies is a good way to challenge certain PCs (eg. weapon attack focused characters)
and forcing them to make strategic choices about PC placement, reaction use potentially using things
like skill checks to control the battlefield instead of regular attacks. Remind them those muscles
are also good for knocking rocks on a pathway. Any AOE focused
character will have a field day but they will also more be vulnerable since their AC probably doesn&amp;#39;t scale as well as the fighter&amp;#39;s and they can get overwhelmed easily. Forcing them to rely on their friends for protection and choose between dealing damage or battlefield control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not use a variant rule or an average?&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately randomness is
part of the rules. If you know how much damage you take when the enemy acts in a certain way,
it removes part of the game that normally makes decision making more interesting/stressful. Randomness and
knowing the number of hits and misses also give more opportunities for narrative diversification. For
a PC it is satisfying/frustrating to know how well their defensive measures worked out. Also I feel like most DMs don&amp;#39;t bother with calculating an average anyway. It is still more math than having a big dude on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

General solution idea: Do this thinking throughout the current day, and have it easily swappable when a long rest is finished.

My failed solution: I tried changing my spell list for the next day by changing my current spell list and just remembering which i switched. But then an unexpected encounter showed up and the session ended before resolving it. So my list of prepared spells is a mix of current and next day spells. And technically illegal to swap spells during the day. And it is hard to remember weeks back what spells were changed.

I use both regular 5e character sheet spell paper and Android app [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spellsdd5](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spellsdd5) to keep track of this. But all spell casting apps I have seen only support 1 spell list per character. It would be really nice if there was a feature to track both current and next day spell lists. Or even just multiple spell lists. One solution is having 2 copies of the same character, but this is perhaps too cumbersome.

Solution I'm looking to try: Write down a ""diff"" or ""difference"" on paper for the updates throughout the day. It would look something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for some advice without loosing too much Karma, if possible.

It is a fact that Ability Scores are useless in DnD rules, all that matters is the Ability Modifier.

I would like in my game to make Ability Scores meaningful again, because I love them. When creating a new character, when I write ""16"" or ""9"" on my character sheet I want to use this number when rolling dice.

&amp;#x200B;

One old idea is to make ability check rolls under Ability Score for a success, and compare the margin with a new scale giving the quality of the success, the DC becoming the minimum quality threshold to achieve .

&amp;#x200B;

**Example:**

Susan the witch is brewing a love potion, she is proficient with alchemist supplies and has Int 15. She rolls 7 on the d20, for a margin of 15-7=8. As she is proficient she adds 2 for a total of 10, witch er... which is exactly the DC specified by the GM. She will find love tonight with a 100% probability of success (if she doesn't drop the flask on the way to the pagan feast).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not satisfied at all with this, for several reasons:

\- It is too much math for the average player

\- Ability modifier becomes useless except for combat

\- Not fancy or anything

&amp;#x200B;

New ideas welcome!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello friends,&lt;/p&gt;

The dungeon has been made as a deadly dungeon, there are lots of orcs and two boss monsters, a melee guy and a spell caster. I'm okay with a total party kill (don't really want one, better for one person to run away alive) it would really set the feel for the campaign.

What I'm worried about is two fold.

The players will blame me. I run the bad guys, I control the dice, I can fudge rolls. I'm killing the characters. For example they let the son of the count tag along because he wanted to and offered the players some rare resource (gunpowder). At the end of the session two of the players told me ""if you kill that kid, I'll...."" or something similar. How am I meant to deal with that.

The players can beat this dungeon. But they have to play smart. At the moment it is A) I'm melee; run up to the enemy and stab/punch him or B) I'm range; stay back and shot/cast at the enemy.

It quickly became apparent that something was amiss, mostly due to the bizarre behavior of the guards.

In one particular encounter, my kobold paladin Riff (a guest character for this quest, as my main character had a backlog of things to go through before an important upcoming storyline and had separated from the group for this mission) and his Dire Weasel Raff (Phantom Steed, giant weasel with doubled HP) were blocked entry to the fort by its captain. Both Riff and the captain showed themselves to be incessantly childish in the growing argument between them, with the captain drawing his sword and threatening to kill Riff and Raff if they tried to take one step into the fort.* Three other guards had also joined in at this point, to back up their captain.

Riff, a conquest paladin, responded with his Conquering Presence ability. Here is where we get into the crux of my issue. We play on Discord, and we have multiple channels (one of which is for DM rolls, so that rolls that rolls which need hidden can be, such as insight or stealth).

Our DM elected to roll 4d20s, of which the rolls went like this: 3, 20, 15, 13.

Only one saving against my ability, my DM then chose to give the captain, the only notable NPC in this encounter, the 20, thus saving him from being cowed by Riff.

After the session, seeing this, I took great issue with this decision. In my mind, the DM basically fixed the game to get the outcome he wanted, while basically stopping my character from frightening the only NPC he cared to intimidate. When I pressed him on this, his reasoning was that the guard captain, already incensed as he was, should be given the highest roll, as he was the one least likely to be effected by my ability.

I continue to feel as if either this unique NPC should have been rolled separately from the group, or if rolled with them should have the first roll, or at the very least a predetermined one. Choosing the best roll and assigning it like that really rubs me the wrong way, similar to if the die were fudged, making the narrative feel fixed by the DM. Overall, fixing the narrative *against* a player is kind of a worrying DM philosophy to me, as it seems pretty close to the 'playing against your players' mentality.

It should be noted that no friendships were ended, no one quit or threatened to quit, etc. I do think we're both entrenched in our opinions, though - I know I am, as I stated above.

But I'd like to hear what you all think. Do you view my reaction and thoughts as justifiable, my DM's? Is this an act you have taken, and how did that go?

*Should be noted that the end reveal was that the guards and prisoners had swapped after an outside force infiltrated the asylum and took control of it, so the guard captain Riff had a confrontation with was actually a violent patient given arms and the task of defending the fort.

Meanwhile, a for a necromancer casting the same spell, it could be percieved as a shove as a wave of necrotic energy tries to displace your essence within your body, doing damage as the necromancer primes your husk to be risen as a zombie.


Chromatic Orb is another one, between Wizards and Sorcerers.

Wizards see an extremely carefully balanced sphere of energy whose formula is probably far too complicated, with a containment barrier to make sure the thing doesn't just detonate in their hand and do themselves a horrible spectrum of damage.

Sorcerers, meanwhile, their chromatic orb is probably much wilder, crackling, unstable, and manifests as the desired element straight away as opposed to stabilizing during the process of casting, as well as likely leaving sone sort of whispy energy trail upon being thrown or launched.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm running Curse of Strahd currently, and I had a plan for next session, but I wanted to see if people considered it a dick move - particularly if a certain set of circumstances transpire. So, over the course of the campaign, the defenses of a town named Vallaki have been whittled down quite a bit. A few guards have died from fights with Undead (and one with a PC - long story), the vampire hunter going by Rictavio has had to flee the town, and last session the PCs killed the single most powerful man in the town, who was on the side of the authorities. Kinda. 

As such, the PCs and the thinned-out guard are more or less the extent of the defenses of the town. In addition, two enemies of the authorities are still kicking about in the town. There are five Vampire Spawn who the PCs have known about for several sessions now and, having killed one but taken a beating in the process, haven't been willing to hunt down for a round 2. And then an enemy NPC they killed a couple of sessions ago ran a cult to Strahd, who spawned those vampires. The PCs did not learn about this cult, and so have taken no actions against it.

As the PCs are likely leaving the town for a day or so next session, I thought it would make sense if the cult and Vampire Spawn rose up and overthrew the town authorities while the PCs were gone, seizing the opportunity while the town is weak. It would also show that hard choices need to be made in Curse of Strahd, and that actions, and inaction (in this case, not hunting down the Vampire Spawn, even if it was understandable) can have consequences. It would also probably help shake the slight feeling of complacency recently, where they could leave town, stop some evil, and then come back to a hot meal, a bed, and a bath. Plus, a fun few sessions of them (presumably, they might just not) attempting to retake the town, however they go about it.

So while I think it makes sense and has benefits, I don't want it to feel like I'm just going ""Hahaha, your victories are meaningless under my god-heel, players"", especially as it'll likely happen when they're out of town (if they stay in town, I imagine it'll go ahead anyway), and also because them not knowing about the cult might make it feel like an ass pull.

&gt; **The Adventuring Day**
When you’re designing an adventure, you rarely have the ability to predict how much or how little the player characters will accomplish in any given stretch of time. As a rule of thumb, you can figure that the characters will probably get through four average encounters, six or seven easy encounters, or two tough encounters before they have to take a long rest.
Since you can’t predict the path your players will choose through an adventure, you can’t really design an adventure around this daily target. But it might be helpful to bear it in mind, so you don’t force the characters into three tough fights in a row or send monsters to close off the dungeon behind them after they’ve already fought their way through four average encounters. Keep the adventurers’ need to rest in mind as you set up your adventures.

See! I wish they would have kept this because it pretty much says ""It's not a really rule, more like a guideline. It's okay not to be able to predict the exact number of encounters.

Specifically, I hear a lot of people say that they're primarily a support class, and I... gotta disagree.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine DMed a one shot the other day, and told us all to bring level 3 characters. Since I've never tried a bard before, I thought, ""Why not?"" I had just watched [A Crap Guide to D&amp;D \[5th Edition\] - Bard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiHXxrCB5yk&amp;list=PLDnRMnDDjAzK5uZLidDUtHtD1iN06Qe0G&amp;index=2) a day previous, so I was pretty excited. I went in as a Level 3 College of Swords Bard with Dissonant Whispers, Sleep, and a few other handy spells tucked in my belt, and let me tell you guys... we vaporized them.

Credit where credit is due, our Cleric landed a crit on his Necrotic Touch and slammed the Boss with 8d10 after turning invisible and sneaking up on him, but the one shot had a number of cinematic moments:

* Myself, our two monks, and our surprisingly dexterous fighter scaling crossbow bolts to climb a 15 foot wall with my +7 to Acrobatics (expertise stacked proficiency +4, +3 modifier from point buy for a total of 7)
* Describing in increasingly suggestive terms to the quest giver (a general in the army) how we penetrated the rear defenses of the opposing force
* Coercing a goblin into committing suicide with a unexpectedly effective use of Vicious Mockery (""Goblins are dumb, goblins are fat; I wish you would drop at the drop of a hat!"")
* One of our monks shoving two enemies off the aforementioned 15-foot wall before suplexing a third off the wall (and surviving the drop
* Stepping out from behind cover and hurling a dagger all the way across the room into the gut of an approaching Orc berserker

Needless to say, this bard (and this one shot) may have been one of the most fun I've had in a while; since then (and since we leveled for progression's sake, as we plan to revisit the characters after a time jump), the bard is now level 7, and just unlocked Dimension Door, so... yeah. Now it teleports.

The DM suggested I just continue to play as him and maybe change my oath to something else, but I feel that the character has no reason to continue when he could just return home. I am in no way mad at the way things turned out, its actually the opposite. I feel like the characters journey is done and it would make the most sense for him to leave and for me to bring in a new character.

The DM wants to keep the high stress of the campaign so he flat out told me the only way for the character to 'leave' the campaign would be for him to die because he doesn't want a character to have a happy ending until the end of the campaign and I feel like that was the DMs way of dissuading me from having the paladin leave.

Brobot is a Neutral Good Warforged Circle of the Moon Druid. I love this character! He's a lot of fun both in combat and out. He currently favours turning into a Steel Bear (Brown bear stats, CR1), an Iron Hound (Dire wolf stats, CR1), or my new favourite, the Copper Squid (Giant octopus stats, CR1). He will also typically cast Moonbeam on his first turn of combat before wildshaping. If he is ever out of wildshapes, he resorts to the Primal Savagery cantrip from XGTE (claws that deal 1d10 acid damage).

&amp;#x200B;

His programming is currently very limited. It has been revealed that he currently has two known directives/programs (basically how he views the world):  


**Primary Directive:** Befriend every creature you encounter.  


**Secondary Directive:** Any creature that refuses friendship is to be considered evil and eliminated immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

Spell components? I could use *heroe's feats* as an example; the spell has a rather expensive material component, in the form of a valuable, gem-encrusted bowl, which the spell uses up.

On the one hand, the book is very deliberate in saying these are specifically required, but then it's hard to know how much to plan for, or lug around, and protect from the perils of travel.

There is a Star Wars RPG system I've read into. Honestly, I can't figure its weird system out, but one of the neat things you can do, by rolling assets, instead of successes/failures is *introduce* something into the scene. The players are sort of like characters in a Star Wars comic, and they can spend certain assets to introduce an element into the scene; the NPCs can do the same, when the players roll negative assets. 

I'm wondering how well something like this might work in D&amp;D? One interpretation is that components are already unnecessary; most caster classes get to start with a focus, and ignore the regular bits, twigs, and refuse they need to cast spells. Even some of the mightiest spells don't require gp value components. This might make some of the spendier spells just have a light limiter of ""how often can you afford to cast this, for the benefit?"", based on how much gold you have, and nothing else. Would you maybe just say ""the wizard wants to scribe this spell, which costs him 700 gp, and several hours of his long rest"", and just say it happened? The money metaphysically disappeared from his pocket, and the inks are present? Say ""the party wants to X, so deduct 1,000 gp from their inventory, the caster produces X's component, and they do their thing. Where did the component come from? Who knows? Must have stopped at a shop on the way. I can see where it feels a little hollow; if the party gets caught, there's no risk of losing the components, and thus costing them the benefits of the spell, and I really like them actually talking to the surrounding world, but that's just me, and who wants to plan out the minutiae of lugging around expensive bowls, or vials of special ink, and having to wait for the next downtime?

As I learn I'm too detail-oriented, and this is not always a popular DM trait, would something like the above work? Is it already what you typically do? Ignore shops, and just say ""we spent some money, and got the stuff; let's skip the interaction""?

**Bolo, weapon**

*Very rare, requires attunement by a monk*

This weapon appears to be a sphere comprised of several interlocking wooden brackets, with a very long leather strap looped around it several times. It has the *finesse*, *reach*, *special*, and *thrown* properties. It is a monk weapon. When thrown, its range is 15/30. After making a ranged attack, you may retrieve the weapon by yanking the leather strap (no action required).


The weapon deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Besides dealing damage, the bolo can be used in the following ways:

* When you hit a large or smaller creature with a melee attack with this weapon, you can attempt to trip the target instead of dealing damage. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw using your Ki save DC or be knocked prone.
* When you hit a large or smaller creature with a ranged attack with this weapon, you can release the leather strap, causing the ball to break apart into a net weighted with wooden brackets. In addition to taking damage as usual, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw using your Ki save DC or be restrained. A creature restrained in this way can break free by using its action to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
You cannot retrieve the bolo by yanking the strap when you choose this option.
* As an action, you trip up distant enemies by hurling the bolo at a point within 30 feet of you. Choose up to two medium or smaller creatures within 10 feet of that point. If a creature you chose attempts to move 1 foot or more on its next turn, it must make a Dexterity saving throw using your Ki save DC or fall prone.

I love the drama of potential PvP, so I’ve allowed it from the beginning. I know it can lead to some toxicity, but we have a carefully worded session 0 document about consent and fun that I think does a good job of keeping the players themselves happy. Besides, it’s allowed a lot of Avengers-esque smack-talk and conflict that has been the high point of some of our sessions.

The problem is now that the PCs are so powerful, if they start a serious quarrel, they can kill or defeat each other so quickly and one-sidedly that it destroys any drama or fun. Back when they were level 3, we had a great moment where the rogue tried to steal something from the bard, so the bard tricked him into springing a trap. This was great, it began a funny rivalry with consistently low stakes: the possibility of actual character murder was low because it simply took too many resources for very little gain. 

Now, that’s changed. The rogue tried to steal something from the cleric, the cleric caught him and cast Geas on him (“You will refrain from taking my things without my consent”). The rogue failed his save. With such a powerful spell, there’s really no recourse for the rogue that he (or I) can see. What’s worse is, if he does find a way to retaliate, the easiest way he can be sure to avoid the spell in the future is to **kill** the cleric. To me, that’s an incredibly degenerative case: the dramatic rivalry is gone, the comical tit-for-tat is gone. 

So how do I prevent the dramatic rivalry of the PCs from culminating in an all out mutually destructive war? With the PCs so powerful, I’m constantly afraid that one snide remark will trigger a nuclear response that ruins everyone’s fun and forces us to get rid of PvP.

None of these are intended to be huge game changing overhauls to the rules. In fact, some of them are light because I was afraid of making big changes to the core rules. Some of them were sourced from a couple spots online and some were created by the group.

I've included the rules in this post but I've also posted the house rules on Google Drive for share. This includes the rules as well as my thoughts on why to include them.

I've given the list to the players and couple of the rules saw action. However, now I'm looking to see what the community thinks of this little package of tweaks just to make sure we're not missing anything. Again, my notes and thoughts on each rule are in the PDF on Google Drive.

These are all experimental for my table and could be changed.

1. ***Players can award inspiration.*** On top of the rules for the DM being able to award inspiration to a player, any player can award inspiration to any other player (pending DM approval). However, a maximum number of inspirations that can be carried by the party at any time is less than the number of players.
2. ***Potions can be consumed using a bonus action.*** Characters can use a potion on themselves as a bonus action. Potions are still an action to administer them on a fellow party member.
3. ***All characters can attempt to use a spell scroll.*** On top of the normal rules for a spellcaster using a spell scroll, a non-caster or a caster without the spell on its spell list can also attempt to use a spell scroll. When doing so, the character using the spell scroll makes a skill check where the DC is equal to 10 plus the level of the spell on the scroll. The characters bonus to this roll is equal to half of their Arcana skill bonus, rounded down. If the character fails the skill check, the scroll is destroyed as usual. However, when a complete non-caster fails the check the scroll reacts violently, dealing a number of damage equal to how much the check was failed by plus the level of the spell. The damage type is the DMs choice, but should align to what kind of spell is on the scroll.
4. ***One level of exhaustion on 0 HP.*** Dropping to 0 hit points grants the character one level of exhaustion.
5. ***Skill proficiency required to Help.*** To use the Help Action to aid another character on a skill check, you must be proficient that skill.
6. ***Two-way blindness.*** When a target can’t see the attacker and the attacker can’t see the target the attack has disadvantage.
7. ***Damage Insurance on Critical Strikes.*** When a player rolls a critical hit on the attack dice, the damage dice will be rolled as normal, rolling twice as many dice. However, the player then finds the single highest rolled value on his highest sided dice and rounds its value up to its maximum value. This will have no effect if that dice is already it’s highest maximum value. *Diagrams in the PDF if this sounds confusing.*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re about 14 sessions into LMoP with players at Lvl 4 and after researching solutions and discussions online and with the group I&amp;#39;ve decided to implement a few house rules to tweak play a little bit. None of these are intended to be huge game changing overhauls to the rules. In fact, some of them are light because I was afraid of making big changes to the core rules. Some of them were sourced from a couple spots online and some were created by the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve included the rules in this post but I&amp;#39;ve also posted the house rules on Google Drive for share. This includes the rules as well as my thoughts on why to include them.&lt;/p&gt;

Long time lurker, first time poster. I set up a new Reddit account because I want to try to get more involved in the DnD community, so here goes nothing. I'm sorry in advance about formatting or post length, just trying to get my feet wet.  


A few weeks ago, a couple of my regular players approached me about doing a new style of game,  but couldn't think of anything that would make the game substantially different from our other games to date. One of my players really liked the idea of Legacy Weapons, or weapons that evolved with the characters as they continued to grow more powerful. I had been getting into the idea of using Tarot Cards as a way to begin an adventure, much in the same way that Curse of Strahd uses a Tarokka Deck to shape the story. After a couple days of mulling it over, I came up with a system that's pretty simple on paper, but turned out to be a really neat and refreshing way to make a character. Feel free to use my setup in it's entirety, or adjust to your own preference. One of the things I found most enjoyable was how easy the system was to tweak, and how much of an impact it had on my players.  


To begin the session, I started the game with each player sitting in the same room as me and one another. The lights were dark, like a seance. I narrated that each of the players found themselves in a nearly endless black space, with a vast void stretching out all around them. Each player appeared to one another as wisps of energy, little motes of light that hung in the air. A figure in a cloak explained that each character had died at a similar time to one another, but that they would be offered the chance to return to the world, albeit with some slight changes. The players eagerly agreed. I narrated that each player was taken to another room by the cloaked figure, while physically proceeding to do so out of game. I then set up my system:  


To determine a Player's race, I had them roll percentile dice that were laid before them. I used a random character generator chart to determine what race would correspond to each roll (I.e. 20-25 for Elves, 55-60 for Dwarves, etc). Once the player had rolled, I would roll a set of dice before me. The player was then free to choose to either use their roll or mine, without being told what each roll corresponded to. After a race was chosen, I would narrate how the mote of light that was their form began to stretch and take on attributes from their chosen race (i.e. scales for Dragonborn, feathers for Kenku, lithe limbs for Elves). Once this process was completed, I would move the player to another station designed for determining their character's stats.  


To determine a Player's stats, I took the numbers from the standard array and placed them on face down index cards that were spread out in front of the player. Players were encouraged to flip over the cards one at a time, and read aloud the number they had chosen. Starting from Strength and going down, we would fill in their character's stats by filling it whatever number they had drawn. Players were read what their possible stats would be, and given a chance to redraw once the cards had been reshuffled. Once they had made their decision, I would narrate how their form began to take on aspects of their decision (a racing mind for intelligence, nimble movement for dexterity, etc).   


To determine a Player's starting Legacy Weapon, they would be given a deck of standard playing cards. Each card had been assigned to a weapon in the Player's Handbook, or an important item (spell book, holy symbol, etc). The player would draw three cards. Once a card had been drawn, I would narrate how a pillar would rise from the void, and the item would be available for the Player to choose. Depending on the order chosen, I would add elemental descriptions to each item (""A scimitar bathed in moonlight sits before you"", ""A bow writhing with flickering flames presents itself"" ""A dagger cloaked in shadow sleepily drifts on the pedestal""). Once the Player had drawn three cards, I would draw a fourth, and choose an element that I felt was appropriate to the weapon. The Player would then choose which weapon they wished to take.   


Finally, the player was taken to a group of Tarot Cards, and asked to choose one that resonated deeply with them. This card would serve as their name to their compatriots, as well as provide them with other possible details (an indication of their past life, possibly attached Feats, etc. For the sake of my players who may be reading this, I'll leave this a little vague and up to your own discretion about what meaning you want to attach to this reading.)   


When all was done, the process would go a little something like this: I would take a player into the room, and explain that we would to begin by shaping their form. The player would be instructed to roll the dice. In this example, they rolled a 94, so they became a Dragonborn. I narrate claws and scales beginning to shape themselves from the mote of light. We moved to choosing their stats. They choose the cards in an order the prioritized Strength and Wisdom, which is lucky, as they were thinking about playing a Cleric to begin with. I explain that their form begins to grow stronger, both in body and in spirit. We move to choosing weapons. They draw a dagger, a whip, a trident, and a warhammer. They choose the warhammer. Finally, they chose a Tarot Card. In this instance, the player drew the Judgement card. The character's temporary name (until another is chosen later in the game) is Judgement. After all this is done, the character is cast into the world and the process begins with the next player.   


All and all, it's a fairly simple system, and I'd be very surprised if it hadn't been done before, but I thought I'd put it out here if any other Dungeon Masters or groups wanted to give it a go and change up their status quo. Hopefully this helps, and thanks for sticking around this long for my first post! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster.

1: Replace Ray of Sickness with Inflict Wounds

5: Replace Contagion with Raise Dead

**Among the Dead**

Add: When you cast False Life you add your Charisma modifier to the the number of temporary hit points gained.

**Defy Death**

Change CON to CHA for number of hit points regained.

Add: When you cast Speak with Dead, if you are hostile to the corpse or it recognizes you as an enemy, it must make a CHA save against your spell DC.  On failure, it is compelled to answer one question truthfully.

**Undying Nature**

Add: You are immune to disease.

**Indestructible Life**

Add: When you use this feature, your hit point maximum is restored to its normal level. 

**Why These Changes:**

Inflict Wounds scales better, making it more useful for a warlock.  Raise Dead fits the theme and gives the warlock more utility than Contagion.

Adding your CHA to False Life makes the spell on the list a bit better, but it also makes Fiendish Vigor better and you can do it at will.  This gives you a substantial THP bump over a day.

Defy Death changing CON to CHA reduces MAD and will give a slight bump in healing.

Speak with dead makes this spell in the expanded list much more useful in dungeons where you can question things you just killed, and makes Whispers of the Grave much better since you can cast it at will.

Immune to disease is a bit nebulous in 5e but monk's have it so it is a thing.  This turns advantage on saves into outright immunity.

Restoring your hit point maximum makes Indestructible Life a bit better, specifically against higher level undead which fits the patron theme.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Spell List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We introduced a new player/PC into the session last night, a Cleric who is working for the Elf Princess the team is helping. Our wizard had to cancel last minute with left us with 4 people, 2 moon druids a firbolg sorceror and the new PC.

&amp;#x200B;

Worried about time constraints around reaching the BBEG and the Mcguffin in time they are pressing on and struggling to not get entangled in any of my various attempts to side quest them.

&amp;#x200B;

Off they go through an underused section of ancient road through a dark and ~~very expensive forest~~  ominous forest. As they leave the road to follow a trail to a large lake they are perplexed by footprints. Always found in sets of 3 they do not recognize what being would create them. As they follow the trail the path gets crossed with more footprints, always in sets of 3. They trudge on and eventually find the bank of the lake. Or where the lake WAS. it is now just a deep and wide (as far as the eye can see) muddy pit. Dozens of these footprints are marchinest towards the west, our party seeing no other option tries to cross the mudpit only its far too ooey gooey to cross. Our druid Molds Earth tirelessly for two hours to create a walkable surface to get halfway across the lake, where they see the scene of a battle with large fishy humanoids apparently having fought a large mound of mold? They stop for a rest. Tossing a few firebolts into the mound of mold seems to burn away the mold revealing something pink and squishy looking. Spooked, they hurriedly continue molding earth to move on. Just as they get around the massive mound (about an hour to get around it!) a section sloughs off, revealing a black glossy bit that looks delicious to our Lizardfolk druid, Stampy.

&amp;#x200B;

Being both intrigued, scared, and hungry from all his work he decides to overcook the damn thing. A full channel of Summon Lightning. 10 minutes of lighting strikes burns out the moss and reveals awkward looking organs and fluids flowing out into big chunks. Now extremely hungry, he starts to summon another storm, hoping to bake the mud into clay so he can walk up to the mound. As he begins this a weird WARBLE is heard in the distance... and then another... from all around. Dozens upon dozens of fish folk walk into site stopping a hundred feet or so from our party. THe lizardfolk immediately drops to his knees and throws his hands in the air. 

So do the fish folk.

Except their leader who is on a palanquin who keeps WARBLE WARBLEING and doing a little dance. WARBLE WARBLLLELRLLELEL THe leader summons power into his staff and touches the druid on the head... casting TONGUES so they can communicate. The Koa Toa thinks the Lizardfolk is a God come to smite down their FORMER god (the mold mound thing...). He backpedals and is nervous about this but is mostly relieved they dont have to fight an army of fish. The Koa Toa remark that their new god is supposed to bring the water back and good ol' Stampy is like.. ""uhhhhh Ill get to that like next week"" TO which the crowd goes wild with Warble Warbles before they break off into prayer circles. The Fish Shaman gives them an ominous warning about the Clackers and the Corrupted Ones that lie in the path they are on, and the party takes this to mean Slaadi.

&amp;#x200B;

Pushing onward, using the rest of the summon lightning to burn as much mud to clay as they can, noticing over their shoulders to the south east is some weird colored smoke. The PCs think the Thayans (undead nation) are at work on Something Big. The next day the forest turns to swamp, a foul swamp where everything is coated in a thick layer of oil or mucus. Our PCs scout out a party of what look to be KoaToans with some weird Scorpian things with them (chuul). Alas when they attempt to ambush it they have moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

After defiling a circle of stones by engraving profanities they move on.

&amp;#x200B;

And pass by the top of a pyramid emerging from the swamp water.

&amp;#x200B;

And past another ring of stones.

ClikclackWARBLE clickclick

They hear moving water up ahead.

clickWARBLEWARBLE

they push onward and find a river cutting through the swamp. 

Stamp swims across intending to use an omovable rod as an anchor on the far shore for a rope. As soon as he gets there the party is attacked.

&amp;#x200B;

2 KoaToashamans riding Chuul, and 3 other WHIPs appear from the swamp side. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the party's first fight with powerful enemy casters so the Control Water forcing them all to swim and Mass Heals take them by surprise, especially after the sorcerer blows her twinspell fireball too early in the fight. Luckily the druids summon several hordes of dinosaurs, spiders, and bears to help even the odds... at least until 3 more Koa Toans attack from the river with nets trying to drag players underwater.

In the end though, despite tons of grappling, hold persons, and paralysis poisons the party prevails with only 1 person going unconscious :( this was a deadly encounter WITHOUT the Chuul.

The event that has transpired has brought about the death of an ally. His soul was not shattered, body was destroyed, and suffered corruption in his latest escapades. This wish is to bring back Vutha Kothar with the following caveats. The soul must be whole, suffering no corruption or external terminality. The body has taken fatal damage at the hand of the beholder (monster), his body must be brought forth restored after the events that have transpired from the second gate encounter the party had together and before the fight with the beholder. A body without the soul cannot function, but a body is not whole without its memories. The memories must be retained up until the point of death. While the life of an individual can be brought back with powerful magic, one must consider where the body comes back. When the individual (Vutha Kothar) is brought back, have him on the ground level next to the beast that has slain him. Thus he will not be spawned in a wall, sunk to the crevices of the sea, torn asunder from a fall to great, or mutilated from being spawned in from of the greater beasts of the world.  


  
There must be a cost to bringing back one from the land of the dead, but the cost shall not include the following caveats. The caster and associates (friends, family, and comrades) of the individual (Vutha Kothar) must not suffer damage, disability, nor trauma. The world must not be warped (geography, ecosystem, environment) from its contemporary state to revive the individual (Vutha Kothar). Must life be traded for life, the trade must be equal in the form of life. No more life than 3 times the size of the individual’s (Vutha Kothar) blood, gore, sinew, bones, organs, pulmonary systems may be used as cost, contribution, or compensation the sacrifice to bring the individual’s (Vutha Kothar) back (That being the case, sacrifice demons and goblins enough to compensate). There shall be no cost materialistic, detrimental to the state of the world, or damning to the individual (Vutha Kothar) or associates (friends, family, and comrades) of the individual (Vutha Kothar).

This gives him a small but steady steam of power from each node.

I want the PCs to quest for a way to remove this taint or curse from each node.

However, I don't want to activate the option until the PCs are level 15 or so. (They are level 10 now.)

**First question:** What spells and powers should I watch out for that could solve this via RAW right now?

I'd like to be aware of these options so I can craft some fiction around them to explain why they won't work other than a ""because I said so"" block.

&amp;#x200B;

**Second question:** Other than a McGuffin, what would be some ways within the rules for the PCs to solve this at 15th level or higher?

I could just create a magic item or book with a ritual. But just curious if 5E has anything baked in and suitable for high level PCs to beat Orcus' curse.

A few sessions ago (party level 3), the barbarian and Bloodhunter perished in an arc finale where a goliath Fighter killed both. What happened was that the Barbarian, whose backstory was seeking a worthy foe to take him down, fought the enemy goliath 1v1 while the party dealt with the minions. He lost and died.

The Bloodhunter, who in-character was struck with grief, and charged in against the goliath and he too perished. The party managed to escape after killing off the goliath. The party, especially the cleric, was really affected by this. 

Now the problem is that the Bloodhunter was also keen on trying out a new class and character, so while he was in-character, the cleric felt that he shouldn't have done that. For me personally, I felt it was really well done and ultimately it's the player's character choice to play how he wants. If the Bloodhunter wants to play a new character and wanted a death to do so, I think he's allowed to do so.

Now at the current time (Party level 7), the party is already introduced to the new characters (Paladin + bard). Everything is fine, party needs some time to adjust to the new members. The cleric doesn't fully trust them yet, understandable. But now, the cleric has access to Revivify and personally contacted me saying something along the lines of:

\*Even if the soul of a character refuses to be brought back to life, I could still trick them.\*

I paraphrased it, but basically the Cleric player didn't like how the Bloodhunter threw his character like that, and is saying if a player ever kills his/her character just like that, he will force them back with revivify. However because revivify requires that the soul of a character WANTS to be revived, he will trick them somehow even if the character refuses to be revived.

I tried to reason with the cleric that ultimately, it's a player's choice if they want to maybe play a new character and want their current character to die if the situation presents itself. But the cleric is saying throwing your character to his/her death is ooc. 

TLDR: A player killed his character when the situation presented itself, cleric wasn't too happy. Cleric PM'd me saying he will force a character back with revivify, even tricking the character, if it means being brought back to life.

So as DM, what should I do? Ultimately as a DM, I want players to have a good time but if one player wants something and the other refuses, I need to come to a compromise. I don't want to avoid possible death encounters just to avoid this issue if it ever comes up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little context: My party originally comprised of a Cleric, a Fighter, Bloodhunter from Matt Mercer, Barbarian and a monk.

So here's the thing : I have this habit of always preparing another character just in case the one I'm playing dies. So while I'm having a lot of fun with the character I'm currently playing, I'm already thinking of what the second one will be. And after a bit of thinking ... I think it'd be rad to play something close to a bloodborne hunter, in terms of look and feel (I'll see what I can do in terms of lore with my DM since it's a homebrew world but I'm not interested in making 100% the same thing as the game in that department).For those who aren't familiar with Bloodborne, a Hunter is someone who's only wearing clothes, because they'd rather dodge an attack instead of blocking. They're meant to move around a lot, but they can use rather huge and slow weapons too. There's a mechanic in the game that makes it so if you get hit, but hit back your enemy immediately, you re-gain some of your lost health. So basically you're always attacking, and never running away from the enemies. Oh, and a Hunter is supposed to use a Trick Weapon, aka a weapon that can take another form and become another weapon, but I don't think such a system would translate well into 5e so I'm not hoping for much here, but if you have any ideas, I'm down for it.

I quickly found the homebrew class Blood Hunter, and it seems to work well with this idea ... but I'm really new to DnD, I don't want to delve into homebrew classes already, it doesn't feel right and because of my lack of experience, I can't tell at first glance if something is overpowered or not. So I wondered what could be done to make a character that's as close to a bloodborne hunter as can be ... and I think the barbarian can really work !

They have unarmored defense, which means I get to play a close-range fighter who will be wearing very nice clothes and no armor.

They have Rage, which works wonder with the idea of getting hit a lot, and hitting back even harder instead of running for your life.

... and that's it so far lol

I have no idea what subclass I could go for, and how to re-flavor the one I'll be choosing, so I'd be really interested in your recommandations. Maybe I should forget about the barbarian and another class would do a much better job at making me feel like a Bloodborne Hunter ?

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently in the Underdark in our campaign. After walking through the cave for 2 days we found a city in ruïns filled with what appeared to be moving houses. Here the Chaotic Stupid Rogue leave the group to get closer to the Moving ""houses"" to find out what they really are. After 15 minutes of walking away from our group, he gets close enough to find out they are Stone Giants. Then he gets spotted by the rock giant cause he wasn't stealthy enough. After running for 3 rounds the giant hits him with a house and instantly knocks him out and gets captured and taken with him by some orcs.

&amp;#x200B;

Next session we ended up moving through the town to get to the place he was being held and cleared it (but left the top floor untouched to first save our captured friend). We enter the dungeon to find him. Somewhere along the way, we felt a strong magic source making me summon using the bag of tricks and making me make to much noise. Enter a dungeon no enemy. Enter a room in the dungeon see the torturer holding a knife on our rogue's throat cause he knew we would be coming because of the noise. We tried talking with the torturer but he proceeded to cut the rogues throat. And then the torturer got killed by a simple magic spell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our paladin's demon armor (long story) saved the rogues life reviving him. We healed up to face the boss after that. Our druid that had this pseudodragon as a pet, used it to scan the throne room and it got killed. So before we could make any plans he used his maul to break the doors and so we had this what we thought the boss fight. After what seemed to be a rather short boss fight we tie them up. And our rogue who lost his money and was looking for his saw this hole that lead to a cave behind the throne and went in with the paladin. After 3 minutes of planning what we would do we entered the cave after them. And when they found the end of the cave they were met by an eyeball followed by another eyeball until they saw 8 eyes. and then he showed the front of the monster manual to show that they just got in contact with the beholder. And this is where the session ended.

My problem is that I am looking for a system simillar to one used in Witcher Tabletop. I like pretty much everything about DnD 5e expect for one thing.

In Witcher Tabletop skills funcion in a way that if you are terrible in Empathy and and you want to use Human perception to see if somone is lying to you. Chances that you won't be able to tell that he is lying are about 90%, while the other 10% are reserved for a very high roll. While in DnD all Characters are basically good at everything to some point.

Yea sure if you have a Wisdom of 18 and you want to use Perception you get a +4 modifier, you are more likely to be successful. Lets say you roll a d20 get a 11 plus modifier, and a DC of a thing that you want to percive is 14 you will be successful. But I find it a bit stupid that if you have a wisdom of 10 you only need to roll 10 or higher to successed. 

While in witcher if a DC for human empathy is 20 and your empathy score is 8 and you have human perception of 6 you  need to roll 6 or higher to be successful. It is much less dependent on luck and more on how your character is built.

We each take turns being the DM and writing and crafting our own stories.

However, it's now beginning to feel as though I'm being purposefully targeted by the group to prevent me from having any decent magic items. 

Every time someone writes new campaign they put in various magic items that are perfect for the other characters, and when I wrote mine I tried to put in something useful and flavourful for all involved. However, when it comes to putting anything in for my character, a dwarven forge cleric, it always seems to just be a +1 weapon.

For instance, one character has a mace of terror, the gauntlets of ogre strength, and the boots of striding and springing. Another has the glass staff, a wand of the war mage and a wand of quicksand. In our latest adventure, we went into a dwarven mithril mine and I thought I'd finally get a good magic item until we found a magic cold damage sword that was perfect for our Hexblade and that was it. All my character has is +1 war axe and war hammer.

I don't know at this point if they're purposefully preventing me from getting magic items to annoy me, or if they just can't be bothered to write anything good for my character. Either way, it's beginning to spoil my enjoyment of the game as they either don't care enough to put anything in for me or they're deliberately trying to make the game bad for me.

I don't know how to bring up the fact that it feels really unfair and is making me want to stop playing DnD altogether, without sounding like I'm whining that I should get magic items. At the moment it's more that I feel like I'm a lesser member of the group than the actual lack of items. I put so much effort into writing my campaign, I even built a wooden castle of several weeks for the final confrontation, and it feels like I just get minimal effort for my character.

Thanks for all the replies guys, I’m gonna message my DM about it and see what he says. I really do enjoy playing with them, and we have a great laugh, it’s just this keeps building and building and making me feel a bit ostracised.

&lt;p&gt;What about any magic item that does not require attunement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally have not used Animate Objects, but my fellow wizard does. Just wondering how badly he could cheese this spell if he really wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also for Adventurer&amp;#39;s League, in case there&amp;#39;s any AL specific rules concerning this, other than a max of three attuned magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I just answered my own question, it says right there in spell description they have to be NONMAGICAL items. Duh. But here&amp;#39;s a related question while I&amp;#39;m at it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you cast this on weapons? Do they get any kind of bonus damage? Or does it just become the damage specified in the spell for the object size, even if the damage for that weapon type is different?&lt;/p&gt;

I am looking for something that suits the outdoorsiness of the 2 regular characters more, so they can use their abilities perhaps more effectively than they would in a dungeon. That's not to say they'll never adventure in a dungeon, but I'd like them to get to know their character's strengths first, if you will.

I'm using the FR setting, but I can work with something that is generic by just replacing the names and lore with FR.

Or, is there a resource for ideas for adventures where I can fill in the details? Setting, monsters, and names where just the narrative and objective/hook is provided? I find I prefer to ""wing it"" rather than follow the script and having to pour through the adventure text trying to find a fact that I'd forgotten. Thanks in advance, and happy gaming.

yall should know that the character is already a level 1 warlock (sorry) &lt;3

Just going to post the topics for discussion about my build so far.

Magical secrets:

6: 

- counterspell (must take)

- healing spirit (fireball and spirit guardians are also options I looked at)

10:

- Steel Wind Strike (destructive wave also an option, not affected by spell sniper or hex-blade's curse so i chose SWS, which is affected by both i think)

- Find Greater Steed (this is the bread and butter flavor core for the character, Pegasus)

14:

- disintigrate (good damage spell, thematic, upcastable)

- simulacrum (really good i think*?* with find greater steed)(prismatic spray, reverse gravity are also options ive considered)

18:

- wish (duh)

- imprisonment (there are a lot of options alltogether, these are the most appealing to me, open to suggestions.)(illusory dragon, prismatic wall were my other considerations)

Now thats out of the way...

Race: human variant

- racial feat: medium armor master

1st level: Warlock Hex warrior for proficiency stuff and shield

levels 2-10: Lore bard, want to rush that level 10 magical secrets without losing too hard early for not having proficiency.

level 11: warlock... 
Eldritch invocations:
There are tons of good options:

- agonizing blast (must take*?*)

- devil's sight, eldritch spear, mask of many faces, lance of lethargy, and grasp of hadar
I think it depends on what you are going to experience (will I need mask of many faces? kinda thing) but i went with eldritch spear. Was considering grasp of hadar because it would add a d6 to the damage if you pulled them strait upward (because flying mount is the core of the character i wasnt sure, thoughts?)

levels 12-18: Lore bard...
important spells i took without making a crazy list would be:

-True polymorph (is foresight really all that good? I feel like I wouldnt want to waste a 9th level spell at the beginning of an adventure, turning into an adult bronze dragon to turn that boss fight seems much cooler imo)

-Teleport

-Feeblemind (seems nice.. INT save on monsters is brutal, not sure though, feedback?)

-Forcecage

-Animate Object (Be Our Guest with silverware from Beauty and the Beast... but they kill you, this seems real good to me)

-featherfall (in this case really crucial haha)...

Other feats (from earliest taken [from ASI] to latest):

- medium armor master (racial)

- Actor (+1 char and some interesting scrying capabilities)

- war caster (obviously)

- Spell sniper (took green flame blade, dont know if its good since i already have booming blade)(took the feat because flying mount + sniper... yeah)

- Lucky (because I am)

*ending armor class of 19* (that +1 from medium armor master lol)

The main reason I built the character like this is because He is a Lance using Hero-Wannabe bard. For a long time I considered going Valor Bard but I dont think its all that versitile in the end (at least by how it looks), I like having that level 6 counterspell.. It would be hard to use a lance as a valor bard as it doesnt scale with dex (even though it should, have you ever jousted? its dex..) and you cant go Cha&gt;dex&gt;con=str... too many stats and not enough dice. easier this way to go Cha&gt;Dex&gt;Con and get the +5 damage modifier along with the proficiency with a level in warlock... Also eldritch blast, shield etc.

Equipment would be something like this at least at the beginning:

- Scale male, lance, shield... yeah.


Just started a campaign and all Im really doing is mapping out an *ideal* future. I kinda get that the whole lance focus without being a valor bard and the squishiness is a bit worrying, the main effect of the lance is to look cool but I figure with a flying mount nothing is impossible.. almost nothing.

So, a nice merchant sign with ""Books &amp; Carpets est. 1999"" would be really cool as a t-shirt design.

So, before I digress more, here is my suggestion. I'd like to hear how you would make it yourself.  


Smoke Grenade  
Common, nonmagical.  


How to make:  
Cook one part sugar and one part saltpeter into a liquid. Pour into a clay container with holes to allow the smoke to diffuse, and allow to cool. Attach a quick-pull flint trigger or a fuse. (Probably will make him roll for it if it is not crafted during a short rest.)  


Description:  
On the rounds after ignition, the smoke grenade will create a thick smoke cloud that will obscure a 10 feet cube for the next three rounds, after which the smoke will dissipate. The smoke will roll off on a slope, and will be blown by a gust of wind. This area will be considered difficult terrain to creatures that don't have eye and breathing protection (goggles/wet bandana).  


Is this too much?

It's definitely not optimised to fuck.
At Level 20, they will be Draconic Sorcerer 14 / Fighter 2 / Seeker Warlock 4.

Now my main struggle is whether to pick Pact of the Chain or Pact of the Blade. As the character's Patron is also a Dragon (where their bloodline comes from) , I always figured that a Pseudodragon would be a perfect match for the draconic theme they have. And Chain is the only legible way to obtain one. 

However, the two level dip in Fighter was to allow them to get proficiency in martial weapons so they can fight more front line. A sorta Spellblade kinda deal. However this is why I'm indecisive on which Pact Boon to take, as it feels like in order to be an effective melee warlock you have to be Blade.

I've been torn about this for a while. I've discussed with a DM and there's a possibility of this character having Frostbrand later on in their journey. So with that in mind, would it still be worth getting the Blade Pact?

I have just updated my Monster Hunter Monster Manual with the newest monsters to the monster hunter world game. The Leshen &amp; Ancient Leshen are both originally from the Witcher series, but with the crossover event, we got to see what they might be like in a monster hunter setting. Now these have already been created in the Book of Beautiful Horrors by another redditor on unearthedarcana, but mine have been created to specifically represent their skills and abilities from the crossover event.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sqoCNe9z7q9u_B7BGdotFzFs0mtt44iw) you can find a seperate pdf with just the leshen &amp; ancient leshen.

Or you can find a completely updated version of the now 157 page monster hunter monster manual with a clickable table of contents below.

One of my groups veteran players took a hiatus and has recently returned. This person loves making ridiculous characters that drive everyone including themselves crazy. For example their original character for the first campaign was a Changeling with multiple personality disorder. That is beside the point though.  
  
So due to some health stuff and timing they had to leave campaign for a few months. So upon their return they wanted to do something epic to screw with the party in a fun way.  
  
They fell in love with a post that was going around our friend group on facebook that was talking about how Werebears are neutral good and so their full moon rampages wouldn't necessarily be bad in anyway, unless people attacked them.   
  
So I am a DM who doesn't mind homebrew as long as I or my players are the ones who made the stuff, and obviously I got final say in how things worked. So this player and I worked together to make them a werebear down to class features.  
  
However to add to the funniness the player wants to be a neutral evil character, for the clashing with the Werebear thing, since they don't even know they are one. They just know they have 3 days a month where they have weird dreams and feel really tired in the morning.  We were really hoping this would lead to some long thing where people start to notice weird things and question things and eventually accidentaly discover the Werebearness. Based off the title I am sure you guys can tell this didn't happen.
  
So this character is a little turd, and they meet the party in this underground tunnel system but they are hiding from the pary initially.   
  
This character enters some combat right at the end getting the finishing blow on a big monster from the shadows with a thrown dagger.  
  
Now important for this is that the psuedo leader of the party is a devotee of Shar, but in my world the gods are kind of blocked from interacting with mortals. So divine powers are more so manifestations of the power of a characters beleif in their deity or morals.  
  
Taking advantage of this the returning player was like yea I am totally an avatar of Shar, how cool of you to notice. The other two players (not counting Shar devotee guy, and returning person), are not having this and trying to prove it isn't true. Eventually after much word smithing and many rolls they eventually convince the guy that this random person in the tunnels is not a devotee of shar.  
  
So eventually stuff happens and the returning player winds up losing a ton of health and because of the shock of the damage is turned into a werebear. So the secret was out in less than 15 minutes.  
    
  
However all is good now, the party informed the new person that they met that the world is literally in danger of being enslaved so he was like well crap I don't want to be enslaved I guess I should join up and help you stop the all consuming evil.  
  

TL;DR Returning player pushed the party too far with a ruse when they met the character. Stuff went wild and the party discovered a secret within 15 minutes of meeting the character that I and the player wanted to hide and let the party discover over time.

Based off the title I am sure you guys can tell this didn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this character is a little turd, and they meet the party in this underground tunnel system but they are hiding from the pary initially.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This character enters some combat right at the end getting the finishing blow on a big monster from the shadows with a thrown dagger.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now important for this is that the psuedo leader of the party is a devotee of Shar, but in my world the gods are kind of blocked from interacting with mortals. So divine powers are more so manifestations of the power of a characters beleif in their deity or morals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of this the returning player was like yea I am totally an avatar of Shar, how cool of you to notice. The other two players (not counting Shar devotee guy, and returning person), are not having this and trying to prove it isn&amp;#39;t true. Eventually after much word smithing and many rolls they eventually convince the guy that this random person in the tunnels is not a devotee of shar.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So eventually stuff happens and the returning player winds up losing a ton of health and because of the shock of the damage is turned into a werebear. So the secret was out in less than 15 minutes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However all is good now, the party informed the new person that they met that the world is literally in danger of being enslaved so he was like well crap I don&amp;#39;t want to be enslaved I guess I should join up and help you stop the all consuming evil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Returning player pushed the party too far with a ruse when they met the character. Stuff went wild and the party discovered a secret within 15 minutes of meeting the character that I and the player wanted to hide and let the party discover over time.  &lt;/p&gt;

I was helping my friend create a character that is playing a Shape of the Moon Druid and we came up with a little twist I could use some advice on.

The character is extremely inexperienced understanding his druid powers and whenever he tries to wild shape, things can go awry...

When attempting to Wild Shape, the character must roll a D20. On a 1, the character loses focus, and nature takes control. The player must roll a D100 and will transform into the beast in accordance with the list below.

If the roll is not a 1, the character successfully wildshapes into the originally intended creature

All other normal rules regarding Wild Shapes apply.

I've tried lobbying for more loot, but that hasn't worked. For example, we fought a werebear and a troll last session and the combined loot off of them was 1 day of rations (equivalent to 1 gold piece) and a broken axe. The only significant loot we've ever received was a shield of missile attraction, and a mace of terror, which we've been told we can only sell for about 50 gold each. I do ask to loot most creatures, and as a group we ask for gold/loot from our quests, but it's usually something like 20 gold divided amongst the four of us.

Two of us have already chosen things, but the other four are undecided, and they asked me (as I'm the most experienced player) for advice, so I decided to be lazy and ask reddit.  

So first, we have our Barbarian.  He's a Half-Orc, with 18 Str, 14 Dex, 15 Con, 12 Int, 14 Wis, and 8 Cha.  He's planning on becoming an Ancestral Guardian.  For him, I was leaning towards advising going into either Fighter or Rogue, but I'm not too sure.  

Next we have our V.Human Ranger.  He has 14 Str, 17 Dex, 14 Con, 13 Int, 16 Wis, and 10 Cha.  He isn't sure whether to go Horizon Walker or Monster Hunter.  For him I was leaning towards going either Wizard, or maybe Cleric or Druid.  

Next is our Wood-Elf Druid.  She has 12 Str, 18 Dex, 12 Con, 14 Int, 18 Wis, and 11 Cha.  She is as yet undecided about her subclass.  She actually has an idea about her multiclass, and is wavering between Wizard or Monk.  

Finally we have our Hill Dwarf Forge Cleric.  She has 16 Str, 9 Dex, 18 Con, 10 Int, 18 Wis, and 13 Cha.  For her I was considering Fighter or Paladin (as it would fit her backstory a bit).

3. Matt Mercer's ressurection rules, DC that grows as you Rez more.

4. Stats roll 4d6 reroll 1s once, take highest three. If total doesnt equal 70 reroll all stats.

6. On a natural 20 for iniative all attack roles for the first turn have advantage, Nat 1 disadvantage

7. Drinking or administering a potion to a willing or unconscious person takes a bonus action.

8. Can use extra attack feature if you have it when you ready an attack.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercer&amp;#39;s speeldriver feat is an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall of stone is instant and permanent, not concentration and 10 mins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on these, any recommendations to add or remove? Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve heard the hype about 5e and I’m trying to get a local group together. 

I wanted to level a wizard, since it was so difficult in 1st edition (last time I tried was before cantrips were invented!) and they look like a lot of fun now. After reading up online, I saw that a Cleric 1/Wizard X multiclass would add tons of survivability as well as utility. I’m looking to fall into a support role for the group.

I came up with a backstory I really liked, which translated on paper into a High Elf level 1 Tempest Cleric/Transmutation Wizard X with the Urchin Background. I used standard array ability scores, with Int and Wis highest, followed by Dex.

As I filled out the character sheet, I realized I had come up with a Wizard that can wear plate armor, carry a sword and shield, cure wounds, cure diseases and raise the dead, disarm traps and pick locks.

Is this normal? For a First Edition player this is ridiculously OP. Would this character be fun to play, or would he steamroll through challenges? Would I find that what looks on paper as OP actually has abilities spread so thin he’s not actually good at anything?

* While cursed, the target has disadvantage on Attack rolls against you.
* While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.

If a player wants to convince sun to turn off because it's hot outside, they simply don't get to roll. Or, in a less ridiculous event, a character who isn't proficient with thieves' tools can't even attempt to pick a lock.
* **Natural 1 Isn't Stupidly Punishing.** Rolling a Nat1 on a skill check makes you fail horrendously, but isn't stupidly punishing. If the party is captured by orcs, and the Warlock gets a Nat1 on a Persuasion check to convince them to let the party go... they might all end up with their mouths gagged, not mauled to death by an entire tribe of orcs.
* **Natural 1 On An Attack Check Makes You Miss, And Nothing More.** I know the post is focused on skill checks and not attack checks, I just wanted to make it clear that I have no intention of implementing those ""funny"" consequences like ""your sword breaks"" or ""you injure your friend by accident""

The maps would be fairly simple round arena maps. There could be some more complex/interesting maps but things like obstacles, roof and wall heights and DCs for things like climbing would all have to be standardized. 

*Players*

Each player would create a character of 10-12th level (Around the power curve where characters are good but not gods yet). Point buy for stats. Feats are legal? (I feel like they aren't that bad). Maybe players can have 1 or 2 alt characters for counter picking. Definitely have a spell ban list. 

*Match*

Matches would be timed at 30-45 minutes (I've played numerous 1v1s and they never take longer). Best of 3 (or 5) fights. Have a third party for clarification on rules.

First, some background:
He was just a regular human, part of a small village with only other humans, and they lived peacefully. He was a gatherer for the village, which had disconnected themselves from the rest of the world almost completely, and he absolutely loved nature, spending most of his time either gathering food or simply relaxing in the forest surrounding the village. Unfortunately, one day an extremely strong warlock stumbled upon the village and decided that having herself some slaves would be nice. The hunters tried to fight her, but failed horribly. Each of the villagers was forced to do whatever the warlock told them to do. Eventually, my character would stumble upon some new fruit, gave it to the warlock, she liked them, and gave him one wish as a reward. At first, he asked for his village to be freed, which he was denied, so then he requested to be allowed more time to himself, in the forest. It was simple, but of course the warlock twisted his words before using True Polymorph to permanently turn him into a Shifter. The way this would grant his wish was simple; the villagers were terrified of this almost feral looking monster, shunned him, and he had no choice but to retreat into the forest, taking nothing but his own weapons and clothes. There, he wanders, protecting his village from any threats that dare to invade it while attempting to figure out a way to overthrow the warlock. As for why he began adventuring, it's likely he accidentally encounters the rest of the group and offers his help, as long as they'd eventually help him out too. Favored Enemy is, as may be expected, Humanoids, because of the Warlock, and Beast Conclave is because of his innate connection to nature and its inhabitants. Besides, he's a gatherer, not a Hunter.

Now, my questions. First off, what subrace should I go? I'm torn between Swiftstride and Wildhunt, since I feel like both fit equally well (either a nimble gatherer that keeps his distance or an experienced tracker, I think both are fine with the story), while neither is much more powerful mechanically than the other either. I want him to be an Archer, so being able to get out of range easily would be useful, but Wildhunt means I wouldn't have to spend a spell slot on Hunter's Mark (nor my concentration) when aiming to track something, which would be useful. Either way, if I go Swiftstride, my Beast will be a panther and I'll have panther-like features, while the same will be true with a Wolf for Wildhunt.

My other question is: Is Hunter's Mark worth it on an Archer Beast Conclave Ranger? I am assuming my DM won't rule my Beast can proc the bonus damage, and while a d6 bonus damage would be nice, it seems like using things like Hail of Thorns, Ensnaring Strike, and Cure Wounds to support my Beast with AoE damage, CC, or healing would be more effective. And then there's Absorb Elements and Beast Bond, which are both just really cool too. Don't get me wrong, I know how strong Hunter's Mark can be, just don't know if it's worthwhile when I'm only gonna be attacking once per turn even at level 20 (since Beast Conclave doesn't get Extra Attack).

Thanks in advance for the responses and sorry if this is in the wrong place.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m planning on playing a Shifter Beast Conclave Ranger (Revised) with a focus on Archery, and have two questions. First, some background:

Maybe you have seen people use a lock pick so you have a vague understanding, but you don't know about the pins, what they do and how many there is. You know, pretty cruical information and its not like dnd characters have access to wikipedia or something.

I try making it up to my players by letting them make a straight roll (without the proficiency mod) for improvised tools, as long as they would have proficiency with the tools (ex.

Anyway, I gave him the Entertainer background, but he&amp;#39;s also a comedian (think Bo Burnham, but with a lute instead of a piano), so anytime he casts a spell he&amp;#39;ll make a joke at the expense of the target. (Examples: cast Unseen Servant and have it trip enemies repeatedly, making fun of anyone who falls from it. Casting Healing Word on an ally, but the &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;stop dying, damnit!&amp;quot;. Also, casting Heat Metal on an enemy&amp;#39;s sword, and poking fun at them for dropping it. And finally, casting Stinking Cloud centred on an enemy, saying &amp;quot;oh, damn, give us a warning would you?!&amp;quot;, etc). I&amp;#39;d love to know some good spells I can make more of these jokes with, and also I need some good Vicious Mockery quotes (ex: &amp;quot;buddy, I think if a minotaur&amp;#39;s outsmarting you, you need to rethink some things.&amp;quot;). Any ideas?
(For reference, yes I&amp;#39;m accepting ideas for past level 5, since I also plan on taking counterspell at level 10 to make fun of spellcasters too).&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know where I want this ability to go(3rd, 6th, 11th or 17th level monastic tradition feature), so I wanted to ask for opinions. 

The idea is to make a grappler who grapples with reach, uses wisdom modifier and proficiency for the grapple check and can also use Dex to attempt to trip them as a separate action. This would make it superior to the grapple to shove prone method. 

My idea is that the Way of the Spider monk uses magically produced webs from her fingertips and begins tangling them up like he’s roping a horse. The strength of the magic webs is based on her wisdom.

So:

Grapple check has a range of 10 ft. Wis+Proficiency+d20 vs Athletics or Acrobatics.

Thereafter, only strength checks can be made to escape. No amount of dexterous maneuvers removes the sticky webs. 

This way, the monk stays out of reach of her opponent while they are unable to move. 

As the monk gains more Way of the Spider features, I would like for her to have the option to spend Ki to restrain her opponent with more webbing(like a single target web spell) so that the monk can move freely. 

This seems powerful, but at the same time, casters can achieve better at 3rd level with a single spell slot, restraining multiple creatures at once while also being able to use fire spells for damage while also igniting the Web for additional damage.

In ""Volo's Guide to Monsters"" on page 105: Falling from grace or rising to it.

If you're a Protector or Scourge Aasimar you can ""fall"" and become a Fallen Aasimar.

If you're a Fallen Aasimar you can ""rise"" to become a Protector or Scourge Aasimar.

Your abilities and ability score increase changes to match.

On page 97 of the Dungeon Master's Guide there's the ""Oathbreaker Atonement"" option that says if a paladin breaks their oath (have to be above 3rd level, I think, to do that, but I might be wrong) they can switch to the Oathbreaker subclass. Later, (usually through a quest) that paladin can atone and choose a *new* paladin subclass or their previous one.

It would make for an amazing character concept to start off as a Fallen Aasimar who was a paladin of vengeance. They succeed in slaying the monster that destroyed their village only to become a monster in the process. Without a purpose in life keeping their oath becomes nearly impossible and they eventually break it in a drunken bar fight by accidentally killing a bystander.

Thus, now an oathbreaker they fall to evil and join forces with a necromancer who is marching an army towards an elven village in the woods. Realizing that having his own village destroyed is what lead him to become this monster  in the first place he has a change of heart at the last moment.

Defeats the necromancer, rises to a Protector Aasimar, and is now a paladin sworn to an Oath of the Ancients to protect this elven village, so no one that lives there would have to understand his pain.

I was hoping to get some opinions here on what people think of the list and wanted to explain my reasoning on some of the changes!\n\n\n**Advanced Battle Maneuvers (Martial Adept modified)**\n\nBoros Legionnaires have taught you martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:\n\n* You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).\n\n* If you already have superiority dice, you gain dice equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up): otherwise, you have a number of superiority dice equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), which are d6(‘s). These dice are used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n*I always felt like the Martial Adept feat was far too weak giving you only one superiority die so I made it scale from 1-3 depending on character level.*\n\n\n**Close Quarters Combat (Grappler modified)**\n\nPrerequisite: Strength 13 or higher\n\nYou've been trained in skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling, learning to turn the tides when getting in arms reach of an opponent and learning to pin them down at the cost of your own movement. You gain the following benefits:\n\n* Increase your Strength Score by 1, to a maximum of 20\n\n* You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.\n\n* You can use your attack action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.\n\n*I added a STR bonus because the feat just felt like it didn't give enough, having to give up an attack to maybe get advantage on the next isn't bad but the later ability hurts you as much as the opponent.*\n\n\n**Horizon Academy Combat Course (Elven Accuracy modified)**\n\nYou’re taught by the legendary archers and duelists from the Horizon Military Academy, they’ve shown you their techniques which grant uncanny aim with attacks using precision rather than brute force. You gain the following benefits:\n\n* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\n* Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll using Dexterity you can reroll one of the dice once.\n\n*This one is mostly just to fit the world a bit better I let it no longer be locked off to just elves but now it's only DEX attacks, super advantage is still great so I'm not worried about it being underpowered.*\n\n\n**Martial Specialization (Homebrew)**\n\nYou’ve worked with a personal mentor and your natural talents are honed with a fighting style made to compliment how you engage in combat. You gain the following benefits:\n\n* Increase to your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\n* You choose one of the following options, you can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\n* Archery: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons\n\n* Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n\n* Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\n\n* Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.\n\n* Protection: When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.\n\n* Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add you ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.\n\n*So I found this mostly from another user's post in UnearthedArcana (sorry that I don't remember who!), I have no idea how well the balance on this one is but it doesn't feel broken, I'm open to opinions though!*\n\n\n**Violence of Action (Homebrew)**\n\nYou’ve learned how to implement aggressive tactics and blitzing formations that keep the enemy on their back foot by constantly pushing forward. You gain the following benefits:\n\n* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\n* As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.\n\n*So this is vaguely based off of Orcish Aggression from a UA, it's basically a free Dash if you're a melee fighter but I'm unsure if that's enticing enough.*\n\n\n**Well-Informed Warrior (Grudge-Bearer modified)**\n\nYou’ve spent a substantial amount of time studying a type of creature. Choose the type you chose to learn much about: beasts, celestials, constructs, elementals, fiends, giants, plants, or undead. You gain the following benefits:\n\n* Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\n* During the first round of any combat against your chosen foes, your attack rolls against any of them have advantage.\n\n* Whenever your chosen creature types make an opportunity attack against you, it makes the attack roll with disadvantage.\n\n* Whenever you make an Intelligence or Wisdom skill check to recall information about your chosen foes, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, even if you’re not normally proficient.\n\n*I opened up Grudge-Bearer to non-Dwarves and made it more about creatures you can research rather than hate, I also made it usable with INT or WIS because it felt right to me.*\n\n\n**Wielding Outside Your Weight Class (Homebrew)**\n\nYou gain a stronger grip and learn proper form to heft large weapons single-handedly.

I was hoping to get some opinions here on what people think of the list and wanted to explain my reasoning on some of the changes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Battle Maneuvers (Martial Adept modified)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boros Legionnaires have taught you martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&amp;#39;s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already have superiority dice, you gain dice equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up): otherwise, you have a number of superiority dice equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), which are d6(‘s). These dice are used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I always felt like the Martial Adept feat was far too weak giving you only one superiority die so I made it scale from 1-3 depending on character level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Quarters Combat (Grappler modified)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve been trained in skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling, learning to turn the tides when getting in arms reach of an opponent and learning to pin them down at the cost of your own movement. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your Strength Score by 1, to a maximum of 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use your attack action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I added a STR bonus because the feat just felt like it didn&amp;#39;t give enough, having to give up an attack to maybe get advantage on the next isn&amp;#39;t bad but the later ability hurts you as much as the opponent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizon Academy Combat Course (Elven Accuracy modified)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’re taught by the legendary archers and duelists from the Horizon Military Academy, they’ve shown you their techniques which grant uncanny aim with attacks using precision rather than brute force. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll using Dexterity you can reroll one of the dice once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one is mostly just to fit the world a bit better I let it no longer be locked off to just elves but now it&amp;#39;s only DEX attacks, super advantage is still great so I&amp;#39;m not worried about it being underpowered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martial Specialization (Homebrew)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’ve worked with a personal mentor and your natural talents are honed with a fighting style made to compliment how you engage in combat. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase to your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You choose one of the following options, you can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archery: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection: When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add you ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I found this mostly from another user&amp;#39;s post in UnearthedArcana (sorry that I don&amp;#39;t remember who!), I have no idea how well the balance on this one is but it doesn&amp;#39;t feel broken, I&amp;#39;m open to opinions though!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Violence of Action (Homebrew)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’ve learned how to implement aggressive tactics and blitzing formations that keep the enemy on their back foot by constantly pushing forward. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So this is vaguely based off of Orcish Aggression from a UA, it&amp;#39;s basically a free Dash if you&amp;#39;re a melee fighter but I&amp;#39;m unsure if that&amp;#39;s enticing enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well-Informed Warrior (Grudge-Bearer modified)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’ve spent a substantial amount of time studying a type of creature. Choose the type you chose to learn much about: beasts, celestials, constructs, elementals, fiends, giants, plants, or undead. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first round of any combat against your chosen foes, your attack rolls against any of them have advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever your chosen creature types make an opportunity attack against you, it makes the attack roll with disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you make an Intelligence or Wisdom skill check to recall information about your chosen foes, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, even if you’re not normally proficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I opened up Grudge-Bearer to non-Dwarves and made it more about creatures you can research rather than hate, I also made it usable with INT or WIS because it felt right to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wielding Outside Your Weight Class (Homebrew)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gain a stronger grip and learn proper form to heft large weapons single-handedly. You gain the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weapons you wield lose the “Two-handed” property so they may be used in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When rolling for damage with weapons with the “Versatile” property, roll damage dice as though you were using two hands even when using one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one is similar to Monkey Grip from prior editions, it definitely has a high power ceiling since a player could wield a greatsword and shield so balance could be an issue but I&amp;#39;m not entirely worried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey that was a long post but if you stuck it out

We have 6 runes to work with, so I was hoping that you wise sages of &lt;a href=""/r/dndnext""&gt;r/dndnext&lt;/a&gt; can help me think of some interesting and unique powers to add to this legendary relic.&lt;/p&gt;

Annoyed about the idea of a character that might object to the party's various killings, looting, lying/misleading, lawbreaking. Even mentioning to me that he hates Paladins and that if he was the DM and I rolled one he would go about trying to kill the paladin. He does grant that maybe his hatred of them has to do with bad people playing them badly, like Lawful Stupid.

I can sort of see this being a problem with an Oath of Redemption Paladin, at least by them not having qualms with the party's actions could conflict with their Oath.

On the other hand, I imagine an Oath of Vengeance far from concerned about lying/cheating/stealing/killing in most adventuring locales. The only thing I see maybe conflicting is if BBEG is not associated with whoever they seek vengeance on. Or if they would bother rescuing a stable boy.

EDIT: I’m not sure I can clarify this thing, my best friend is an awesome person and the main reason I’m back playing DND. Don’t exactly put him in a decent light with his “If I were the GM for this game I’d kill Paladins.” He is truly helpful and a great dude.

Part of his objection to me building backup Paladins is that it’s not too far from what I last played as an Eldritch Knight, as well as the group kind of getting used to DND and aren’t much for Role Playing, with the Paladin having a higher role play aspect than how most are running the game.

Shifting the focus off from my friend (I’m absolutely certain he wouldn’t abuse me if I played a Paladin in one of his campaigns), I have my own concerns about running Paladins because of my own experiences of others playing them and shared horror stories about them.

The intro to the class is very Holier than thou Knight-y in my view, and then only shifts a bit from that once getting to the Oath of Vengeance in the player’s handbook. That was just how I saw it.

Do the paladin pick a fighting style now? Or the Druid should choose a Druid Circle? Or are these like the other feats that they can choose when they hit lvl 4-8-12 etc?

So I’m back with another flavor-packed subclass homebrew.  This time I wanted to try and convert the All-for-One quirk from My Hero Academia into a workable subclass.  I came to the conclusion that I wanted to keep the abilities but strip the flavor back so you can make your own hero (or villain) flavor. Captain Mantis-Shrimp hoooo!

I bounced around the idea of trying to do this in barbarian but it seemed off to try and shoe-horn In unarmed strike rules when it could just bring over resistances from the former instead since that’s an existing subclass trope.

Check out the draft here: 

https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/S17ghzV-dE

Since I always get balance inquiries with people who don’t read the full block of text, I’m including explanations below:

Empowered physique - I wanted there to be a build where instead of the dodge flavor that comes from dex there was the option of “I’m so strong your attacks bounce off my body like insects on a windshield!”  Well, you get what I mean.

Smash - potentially super powerful yes, especially at level 3 &amp; 4 where part of the trade off doesnt exist (rectified at 5).  Forgo your two attacks for one chance at the same damage with added effects!  But beware, you might end up taking recoil if you aren’t careful.  
Note: need to specify that you need to decide how much Ki to spend before knowing if the attack hits or misses.

Paragon Form - your body is getting used to your ability to exert a lot of force!  I dabbled around with hours and minutes and couldn’t come up with anything that seemed fair outside of - ki activation with a max-time-per-LR.  Open to ideas on how to modify this. 

Peak performance - originally I wanted this to also include advantage on WIS saves against mind control effects but decided that should be up to the player where they want the trade off to be - strength or dex, con or wis.  The build is about being physically prominent so mental defenses were overlooked.

Indomitable Resolve - I’m a strong believer in capstones being a cool new on-use ability or something that impacts your previously gained features and this adds a bit of both.  I did feel it was necessary to limit the Ki-boosting potential on the smash attacks from flurry.

Looking for some great feedback on potential improvements!

1) Would you say Invoke Duplicity is closer to Major Image or Silent Image? I know that attacks pass through it (found out on [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/10/06/what-happens-when-a-duplicate-of-the-invoke-duplicity-domain-is-attacked/)), but is it similar to Major Image in that it reproduces effects that make it seem real (smell, sound, temperature)?

&lt;p&gt;1) Would you say Invoke Duplicity is closer to Major Image or Silent Image? I know that attacks pass through it (found out on &lt;a href=""https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/10/06/what-happens-when-a-duplicate-of-the-invoke-duplicity-domain-is-attacked/""&gt;Sage Advice&lt;/a&gt;), but is it similar to Major Image in that it reproduces effects that make it seem real (smell, sound, temperature)? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If it is like Major Image, do you think I could make it speak (though it doesn&amp;#39;t mention that in the PHB), or is it a &amp;quot;you have to ask your DM to see if they allow it&amp;quot; kind of thing?&lt;/p&gt;

Add: When you attack with your pact weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. 

**Life Drinker Invocation**

Change to: When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to 1d4+4 and you gain half that many temporary hit points (rounded down).  At level 17 the damage goes up to 2d4+8.

**Why these changes:**  This is an attempt to make blade pact work with or without hexblade (since hexblade does not need blade pact).  The goal is to make using the pact blade weapon worth doing.

Normally a subclass adds to what you already do, so everything is a bonus it is just a question of how good.  But blade pact wants a warlock to use a melee weapon instead of eldritch blast - which means the melee weapon has to be at least as good as eldritch blast just to break even.  Currently a blade pact needs 2 invocations (thirsting blade and life drinker) to be not quite as good as eldritch blast with one invocation (agonizing blast).

Additionally melee warlock in light armor can boost strength to wield a good weapon or dexterity to have a decent armor class but not both.

Using Charisma to attack with allows the warlock to ignore strength and boost dexterity as their secondary stat for armor class.  

The Life Drinker change increases the damage of a greatsword warlock with hex to be just better than an eldritch blast warlock with hex.  And it gives you a replacement for Fiendish Vigor, so you need 2 invocations but you get the benefits of 3.

Animate weapon with 5 psi points (6th lv limit) would be 5d10, so on a hit you would do 3d8 + 5d10 Damage for an average of 51 points of Psychic Damage and as long as you don&amp;#39;t lose concentration on Shadow blade you can do this once a turn for 9 more turns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9th level you could bump that up to 5d8 + 7d10 or average of 61 but that would be max damage until 14th level where you get one more d8 or max of 65.  But after that you are maxed out on that damage due to psi spending limit.  With Psi Mastery (starting at 11th level) you could bump that up to 5d8+9d10 for a max of 73 damage on a hit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you rule on this as a DM?  Does this seem Oped? Or is it in line with most other spell casters?  &lt;/p&gt;

Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you.  That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction with a bonus to its damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Bulwark**

When a creature within 60 feet of you, that can see or hear you, fails an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to let them re-roll the saving throw and use either roll.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

**Why the changes**

Rallying Cry is a nice idea that just needs more healing at low levels without raising the healing too much at higher levels.  And the need to see the fighter is removed so you can use it on downed allies.

Inspiring Surge can be great already if it lets a rogue make an attack with sneak attack damage.  This just gives the damage a slight boost.

Bulwark was almost impossible to use - the fighter and another character both had to fail a saving throw from the same effect.

===============================

# Marionette

*Cantrip Necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a humanoid you can see dies.

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small puppet)

**Duration**: 24 hours

**Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock

This spell allows you to trap the soul of a dying creature in it's own body and make it into an undead servant. The creature gains a number of hit points equal to half of its maximum. Each round, you may give the creature a command as a bonus action, which it must follow to the best of its ability. If you control other undead that can be commanded (such as through the spell Animate Dead) you may give them all the same command as the target. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it may make a charisma saving throw. On a success, it's soul escapes the body and the target becomes a normal zombie (the DM has the creature's game statistics) under your control.

You may only have one non-zombie creature that has been controlled by Marionette at a time. If you cast this spell again while you control a creature that has not passed its saving throw, it's soul escapes your control and it becomes a normal zombie under your control

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of X+1th level, the creature only makes a saving throw once per minute. At X+2th level, it makes it's saving throw only once per day(?). (note: Maybe make it permanent at really high level?)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m creating a custom spell for my character, but I&amp;#39;m not sure what level to make it.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few design choices in 5e that I don't agree with (as any DM). I was wondering if I could sound out what the community thinks on each of these?

&amp;#x200B;

**Vancian Wizards**

When a wizard prepares a new list of spells, they select one wizard spell for each spell slot they possess. They must be able to cast the spell using the selected spell slot (for example, a 3rd-level spell could be selected for any spell slot of 3rd-level and above, but not for a 1st- or 2nd-level spell slot).

A prepared spell may only be cast using the spell slot(s) allocated to it. If the character expends a spell slot for reasons other than casting a wizard spell, the character must choose which slot (and hence which prepared spell) is lost at the time of expenditure.

In addition, a wizard may prepare a nmber of spells equal to their Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). When a wizard regains spell slots using arcane recovery, or another class feature or effect that allows the recovery of spell slots, they must assign each of these slots a spell chosen from this list of prepared spells.

&amp;#x200B;

The philosophy behind this decision is to reinstate the tradeoff of previous editions, where a sorcerer had more in-moment flexibility but less overall flexibility and the wizard vice versa. This is also linked to a few minor buffs to the sorcerer that I don't feel like I need feedback on (giving them the whole sorc + wizard spell list, and giving them a new spell at each level rather than having some dead levels beyond 10th).

&amp;#x200B;

**Decreased Passive Scores**

The passive value for a skill check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus (if any) + your ability modifier.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes passive perception somewhat weaker, meaning that enemies actually have a chance of stealthing against the party. It also means there's an actual benefit to making an active check, where before you were just as likely to do worse when actively looking for things as you were better. This system also matches the existing 'passive' DCs like spell save DCs. This is the only change here I've actually playtested and I like it a lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finesse Weapon Debuff**

A weapon with the finesse property allows you to use your Dexterity modifier for attack rolls, but not damage rolls.

Fighters and Rangers have an additional option for fighting style. Assassin Rogues get this fighting style upon choosing the archetype.

*Finesse Fighter.* You may use your Dexterity modifier for damage rolls made with finesse weapons in place of your Strength modifier. 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to make Dex a little less of a crutch stat, and Str a little less of a dump stat. Rogues don't take much of a damage hit because their primary damage is from sneak attack; everyone else who wants to melee weapon must either specialise a little more or spread stats more evenly (so fewer Rangers and Fighters who are supposed to be elite warriors but who couldn't lift a cat).

&amp;#x200B;

Skip about halfway down if you don’t care about the fluff and just want to see the rules we added for minions. 


In our current game 5e, I play a Flawke, a half-orc rogue (currently lvl 5) on a quest to build an army in order to retake my rightful claim to the kingdom and birthright my younger (and admittedly much stronger brother) stole! 

While we quest to make claim on a bounty in a neighboring province, our party happened upon a small human trading village with a bit of a problem. An invading gnoll army marched towards New Brunswick. We used a show of force to recruit a small band of goblins to aid us as we helped the village prepare their defenses. I quickly assigned Bree-Yark as commanding goblin general to the small force and Pissant to be my first mate. 

Due to our druid’s well-crafted ambush and the town’s solid defensive position atop a plateau, we held off the invading force suffering only minor casualties. Unfortunately, Pissant was one of the first to go. He fought valiantly contributing greatly to the gnoll slaughter we left in our wake. Unfortunately, while attempting to leap from a burning tree, he plummeted 50 ft to the forest floor below. Prone, hurting, and without anyone to help, a lone gnoll leaped on him and cleaved his body asunder. My half-sister, a barbarian, made short work of the offending gnoll, but she was too late. 

After the battle, I worked to build trust between my newfound goblin army (a meager squad of 7 now, really) and the small township of New Brunswick. We’ve worked out a peace where the goblins provide protection of the town’s southern trade route in exchange for food and resources. As my comrades helped to rebuild the village after the hard fought battle, I was busy training our new goblin guard. 

In a show of loyalty, Bree-Yark has offered the services of his eldest son to our party. Snigbat is their newest witch doctor of sorts (cleric). We now work finalize both a newfound alliance and preparations for the journey to come. We welcome young Snigbat to our party in hopes of some day returning him to his people, a leader and a warrior. Together, our party ventures off into the unknown. 




In order to add a little flavor while giving my new minion some depth, our DM and I worked out a little system to add minions to our game. It involves significantly reduced EXP acquisition, but it works well for the little guy as he’s still a child (whoever said war was pretty?) Let me know what you think! We’d love some C&amp;C. 


MINIONS REDUX
Two types of minions
 - Static Minions (no changes, no natural stat increases, no natural progression)
 - Dynamic Minions (can level up in ONE class, gets all the bennies of leveling up)

Dynamic Minions are known as ""Enlightened"" Minions.

GAINING MINIONS
You can only have your CHA bonus in Enlightened Minions.
You must first acquire the Minion through normal RP means.
Only Minions with complete, self-determined loyalty can become Enlightened.
Only Intelligent (min 4) creatures can become Enlightened Minions.
You can Enlighten any Minion at any time but cannot reverse it.

BASE MINION STATS
Enlightened Minions start with the same Stats and Abilities as shown in the Monster Manual.
Enlightened Minions start out at Lvl 1 of the Class you've chosen with all the benefits.
They lose whatever HP they had previously and get the class's MAX HP + CON Bonus at Lvl 1.

LEVELING UP MINIONS
Enlightened Minions get a sort of Minion EXP.
Minion EXP is generated each time you gain EXP.
Take 25% the EXP your gained and divide it up among minions. Always ROUND DOWN. This number is derived from your gained EXP, but it is not taken from your gained EXP. 

If you gain 100 EXP, you have 25 Minion EXP. If you have 2 Enlightened Minions, they each get 12 EXP. If you have 1 Enlightened Minion, they get the full 25.

Enlightened Minions use the same EXP table as Players. 
Enlightened Minions must be with the Leader in order to gain XP. 
DM determines if minion XP was gained. Ex: rogue figures out a trap and opens door alone, gains xp, minion xp is not gained.

You can either roll the Enlightened Minion's HP when they level up OR take the base HP gain in the PHB.

SHORT REST
Enlightened Minions cannot use HIT DIE to heal. Instead they get (1/2 their Hit Die's total + CON) * Level.

So a Level 2 fighter with 12 CON would get (5 + 1) * 2 = 12 HP with a short rest.

LONG REST
All HP is healed as normal.

MINION NOTES
Enlightened Minions keep all their normal Actions in the Monster Manual at the DM's discretion.
Enlightened Minions do not gain any equipment upon becoming Enlightened.
Enlightened Minions do not make Death Saves. If they are not healed within 3 turns, THEY ARE DEAD.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is long. Skip about halfway down if you don’t care about the fluff and just want to see the rules we added for minions. &lt;/p&gt;

In our latest campaign, I'm playing a Gloom Stalker Ranger. The stats I rolled were very average. Right now at level 5 I'm looking at the following:

&amp;#x200B;

STR: 11, DEX: 16, CON: 14, INT: 11, WIS: 13, CHA: 11

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's the thing, Gloom Stalkers CAN be amazing, because in darkness, they are totally invisible. Thing is, that hardly happens. So I was thinking of taking the Mage Initiate Feature so that I can get the Control Flames Cantrip (as well as Guidance and Faerie Fire). I like the idea of walking into a room and snuffing out all the torches and then being completely invisible. Plus, Guidance and FF are nice.

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is that at fifth level, I only get 4 more ability score increases before max (and I'm probably going to dip into Rogue for three levels, so actually only 3), and even then, that won't be for ages. Obviously I want to max out my Dex first, but should I up my Wisdom/Strength, or take the Feat after that?

**the following is a trio of ""optimizations"" that may or may not be broken, and are designed purely for the fun of it.**  
**always consult your dm before pulling up some weird shenanigans.**

**also if you know a way of using other material to further push one of these, or see some issue,** **~~beyond the stacking of powerful build, brawny and aspect of beast being a bit iffy~~****, then be more then welcome say so down below.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Optimization of ravens.**

* race: kenku
* Classes: pact of the chain raven queen warlock 3/beast master ranger 3/circle of the shepherd druid 14
* significant abilities:
   * pact of chain: an improved raven familiar
   * sentinel raven: a sentinel raven
   * ranger's companion: a raven companion
   * Conjure Animals: when casted via a 7th level spell slot, 24 ravens appear with a concentration, up to an hour
   * faithful summons: upon being reduced to 0 hp or are incapacitated, you effectively cast conjure animals as a 9th level spell, with no concentration limit and summon 4 ravens.
      * talk with the dm if you can actually summon more then 4 ravens, as that is based upon conjuring cr 2 creatures, and not 1/4 which could be summoned to a maxium of 32 ravens

**Conclusion: one kenku, and 31 Ravens, or alternatively 59 Ravens, if dm allows faithful summons to conjure the lower cr limit of critters.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Optimized acidic jab.**

* race: Half-efl for a +2 charisma, +1 strength and +1 intelligence
* Classes: alchemist artificer 9/draconic sorcerer (Black/Copper) 6
* for simplicity, it is recommended to point buy to have 
   * 15 strength, +1 from race
   * 8 dex
   * 10 con
   * 15 intelligence, +1 from race
   * 8 wisdom
   * 14 charisma, +2 from race
* significant abilities:
   * simple weapons proficiency
      * specifically, the yklwa, a simple weapon from tomb of annihilation that deals 1d8 piercing damage
   * infuse item: guaranteed bag of holding
   * arcane armament: extra attack with magical weapons
   * alchemical mastery: add your intelligence modifier to acid or poison damage of spells
   * metamagic: extended metamagic makes spells last longer
   * draconic resilience (black/copper): add your charisma modifier to acid damage of spells
   * glyph of warding: if a concentration spell is stored within this spell and then activated, you do not need to hold the concentration and it lasts for the maximum duration
   * Elemental weapon: when casted as a level 5 spell to a non-magical weapon, it becomes a +2 weapon that deals extra 2d4 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage
      * take your yklwa, shove it to your bag of holding and cast glyph of warding containing elemental weapon, preferably under extended spell metamagic. as long as you keep the yklwa within 5 feet of the bag of holding the spell \*shouldn't\* break.
   * arcane weapon: when casted upon a weapon, it deals extra 1d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage

**conclusion: when all of this gets applied, you get a weapon that deals 1d8+2+3 piercing damage, and 1d6+2d4 acid damage and you have four instance of +3 acid damage that can be applied at will, for a total maximum of 1d8+5 piercing and 1d6+2d4+12 acid damage.**

* note that the four instances of +3 acid damage come from draconic resilience and alchemical mastery, giving both arcane weapon and elemental weapon a bonus that can be applied once, and as we know, 2\*2=4
   * also, [according this](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2019/03/16/does-the-artificers-level-6-alechmical-mastery-apply-to-the-arcane-weapon-spell/) sage advice, alchemical mastery affects arcane weapon once, from which it is assumed it works the same with draconic resilience and elemental weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Max lifts**

* race: anything with the powerful build racial ability, but for certain reasons, we'll use bug bear in this example
* Classes: order of immortal mystic 9/totem warrior barbarian 6
* significant ~~abilities~~ things:
   * obviously, powerful build racial ability as that makes you count one size category larger
   * **MUST** be 8 feet tall.
   * giant belt of power(strom giant) OR a potion of giant power OR a lucky chance you are under effect of the potion of giant power permanently
   * a friendly caster OR a potion of growth OR a lucky chance you are under effect of the potion of growth permanently
   * a friendly caster with enhance ability, the type being bull's strength as that makes you count one size category larger
   * giant growth mystic discipline, for the giant from ability which turns you huge
   * aspect of the beast, specifically bear which makes you count one size category larger
   * brawny feat

**Conclusion: so, now that all of that is typed out, let's see the calculation to our final carry capacity**

* **29 (strength)**
* **\*15 (base carry capacity)**
* **\*2 (large size, giant form)**
* **\*2 (huge size, giant form)**
* **\*2 (gargantuan, enlarge/potion of growth**
* **\*2 (colossal, your natural height) ¤**
* **\*2 (????, powerful build)**
* **\*2 (????, brawny feat)**
* **\*2 (????, aspect of the beast)**
* **\*2 (????, enhance ability)**

**all in all, you would have, while all of this is active, a carry capacity of a massive 111 360 pounds, or 55.68 tons.**

*¤as this part might be somewhat bizarre, let me explain* *~~a bit.~~*  
*according to* [*this*](https://dungeons.fandom.com/wiki/Table:_Creature_Size_and_Scale_(3.5e_Other)) *chart, which seems to be largely accurate in 5e, a creature tall as 8 feet is technically in-between being a medium and large creature, and this ratio stays the same as your size increases.*  
*if we assume giant form keeps you on percentage upon changing size, as in a 6 feet tall medium creature, which is in the middle of the size array would retain same ratio while under effect of an effect such as giant form and thus be 24 feet tall,  meanwhile a medium creature that is 8 feet tall, being in-between medium and large would be then 32 feet tall and be in-between huge and gargantuan and as this gets then increased by enlarge to 64 feet tall, you'll be in between gargantuan and colossal and thus, technically valid for either size category.*

**now, let's say why I'd say go with Bugbear instead of any other class with powerful build.**  
ye see, as you focus on the giant growth discipline you gain +5 reach, while you are in giant form you gain +10 reach, as a bugbear you gain +5 reach and a reach weapon has +10 reach instead of +5 reach on other weapons.

all of this together gives you a reach of 20 feet.  
add 5 levels of primeval guardian ranger for another +5 reach, as well as the tunnel fighter so that you can do opportunity attacks with no reaction cost, at the reach of 20 feet (as bugbear long limbed doesn't work on opportunity attacks) at the cost of a bonus action.

~~sorry for a long post, and sorry if the flair is wrong, it's the closest I could think that would fit~~","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the following is a trio of &amp;quot;optimizations&amp;quot; that may or may not be broken, and are designed purely for the fun of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;always consult your dm before pulling up some weird shenanigans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;also if you know a way of using other material to further push one of these, or see some issue,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;del&gt;beyond the stacking of powerful build, brawny and aspect of beast being a bit iffy&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, then be more then welcome say so down below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization of ravens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;race: kenku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes: pact of the chain raven queen warlock 3/beast master ranger 3/circle of the shepherd druid 14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significant abilities:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pact of chain: an improved raven familiar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sentinel raven: a sentinel raven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ranger&amp;#39;s companion: a raven companion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjure Animals: when casted via a 7th level spell slot, 24 ravens appear with a concentration, up to an hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faithful summons: upon being reduced to 0 hp or are incapacitated, you effectively cast conjure animals as a 9th level spell, with no concentration limit and summon 4 ravens.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk with the dm if you can actually summon more then 4 ravens, as that is based upon conjuring cr 2 creatures, and not 1/4 which could be summoned to a maxium of 32 ravens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: one kenku, and 31 Ravens, or alternatively 59 Ravens, if dm allows faithful summons to conjure the lower cr limit of critters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized acidic jab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;race: Half-efl for a +2 charisma, +1 strength and +1 intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes: alchemist artificer 9/draconic sorcerer (Black/Copper) 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for simplicity, it is recommended to point buy to have 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 strength, +1 from race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 dex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 con&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 intelligence, +1 from race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 wisdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 charisma, +2 from race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significant abilities:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple weapons proficiency

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically, the yklwa, a simple weapon from tomb of annihilation that deals 1d8 piercing damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;infuse item: guaranteed bag of holding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arcane armament: extra attack with magical weapons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alchemical mastery: add your intelligence modifier to acid or poison damage of spells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metamagic: extended metamagic makes spells last longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draconic resilience (black/copper): add your charisma modifier to acid damage of spells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;glyph of warding: if a concentration spell is stored within this spell and then activated, you do not need to hold the concentration and it lasts for the maximum duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elemental weapon: when casted as a level 5 spell to a non-magical weapon, it becomes a +2 weapon that deals extra 2d4 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take your yklwa, shove it to your bag of holding and cast glyph of warding containing elemental weapon, preferably under extended spell metamagic. as long as you keep the yklwa within 5 feet of the bag of holding the spell *shouldn&amp;#39;t* break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arcane weapon: when casted upon a weapon, it deals extra 1d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;conclusion: when all of this gets applied, you get a weapon that deals 1d8+2+3 piercing damage, and 1d6+2d4 acid damage and you have four instance of +3 acid damage that can be applied at will, for a total maximum of 1d8+5 piercing and 1d6+2d4+12 acid damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note that the four instances of +3 acid damage come from draconic resilience and alchemical mastery, giving both arcane weapon and elemental weapon a bonus that can be applied once, and as we know, 2*2=4

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, &lt;a href=""https://www.sageadvice.eu/2019/03/16/does-the-artificers-level-6-alechmical-mastery-apply-to-the-arcane-weapon-spell/""&gt;according this&lt;/a&gt; sage advice, alchemical mastery affects arcane weapon once, from which it is assumed it works the same with draconic resilience and elemental weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max lifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;race: anything with the powerful build racial ability, but for certain reasons, we&amp;#39;ll use bug bear in this example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes: order of immortal mystic 9/totem warrior barbarian 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significant &lt;del&gt;abilities&lt;/del&gt; things:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obviously, powerful build racial ability as that makes you count one size category larger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; be 8 feet tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giant belt of power(strom giant) OR a potion of giant power OR a lucky chance you are under effect of the potion of giant power permanently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a friendly caster OR a potion of growth OR a lucky chance you are under effect of the potion of growth permanently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a friendly caster with enhance ability, the type being bull&amp;#39;s strength as that makes you count one size category larger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giant growth mystic discipline, for the giant from ability which turns you huge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aspect of the beast, specifically bear which makes you count one size category larger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brawny feat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: so, now that all of that is typed out, let&amp;#39;s see the calculation to our final carry capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 (strength)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*15 (base carry capacity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (large size, giant form)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (huge size, giant form)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (gargantuan, enlarge/potion of growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (colossal, your natural height) ¤&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (????, powerful build)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (????, brawny feat)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (????, aspect of the beast)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*2 (????, enhance ability)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all in all, you would have, while all of this is active, a carry capacity of a massive 111 360 pounds, or 55.68 tons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;¤as this part might be somewhat bizarre, let me explain&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;a bit.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Ravnica is a whole new world for your D&amp;D campaign to explore. A vast, sprawling city that covers the whole of the known world, Ravnica teems with intrigue and adventure, driven by the conflicts among the ten powerful guilds that rule the city.

Back ground:

A child raised as a gladiator with zero social skills.

In the fight he doesnt get mad, doesnt rage or even speak, just kills (not a rogue, doesnt sneak, doesnt understand subtlety.)

Any ideas? a Straight champion i thought but its a bit too dull, I might go if I cant find anything more flavourful.

Cracks his whip ""Down people, Down you savages!""

Cold emotionless killers?  I should Take a few level in Reddit lol

&amp;#x200B;

I just said IN THE FIGHT.

Outside the fight its called character growth lol let him get used to the group, share their adventures open up slowly, share his back story after a harrowing experience, watch him blossom.

Character progression people.

And yes I hate Edge lords who remain an Edge lord too. lol I am the BIGGEST talker, I literally cannon shut up so playing someone who will be mostly silent for the first few sessions, until he come out of his shell, will be a big challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

Brute Fighter is so far the best idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Its Nature versus Nurture if he was kept isolated and found making friends would be pointless if he was forced to kill them.

Obviously not Roman Gladiatorial matches, these would be death matches, plain, simple, brutal.

Hello again friends! So a small announcement. This Friday and Saturday starting at 0700 EST I will be 3D modeling from sun up to sun down as many 3D printable models as I can that my patrons post on my [Request board!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/23265492) If you’d like to watch how I 3D model you can see me on [twitch here.](https://www.twitch.tv/mz4250)

So about this submission! I’ve recently started 3D modeling and printing the fantastic monsters from Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes! Here are the monsters from Letters A, B, and C. I also just started working on the Demons recently but that will be in another post. 

In case you haven’t seen my works before, I've been 3D modeling and printing my own D&amp;D minis for the past four years. I always share the files for free. Here are my galleries so far, with free access to the files under each image:

An update to what my players in a play by post game have been getting up to. This is all in one shared world, all happening on one continent within the same year. Because of different levels of activity and playstyle almost all of them are on a different day of the year. As some have advanced farther down the timeline than others because of downtime activities and travel time. This is part 1 of 2 for this update.       
My first post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/an0lre/first\_play\_by\_post\_turned\_into\_epic\_narrative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/an0lre/first_play_by_post_turned_into_epic_narrative/)

1. Mudamin, the Yuan-Ti cultist, arrives at the Elven city of Valentia. He seeks honest work to make a quick buck to support his expensive training in sleight of hand proficiency. He quickly realizes honest work isn’t lucrative enough for him and turns to the streets. He sniffs out some rumors and finds a couple things to coincidental to be seperate events. Over the last month rumors have circulated of a cult worshipping devils in the underbelly of this farming community. Towards the center of town where the estates and fine shops are a psychic warrior has been seen attending college classes at a small local university. And barely a week ago an imp was spotted skulking about the fine estates of the inner city. Mudamin began his investigations at the college. Where he discovered the psyker was attending classes to gain the linguist feat. He was studying draconic, primordial, and infernal to sharpen his mind. He hinted that a sharper mind would only increase his telekinetic and telepathic powers. His choice of studies though worried Mudamin and he knew he would have to be on guard around someone who might try to read his thoughts. 
2. Roven, the Lythari Elf soldier, fought in the defense of the city of Barcino. While the calvary ran down the enemy camp, and the infantry held trenches, the scouts and archers manned the wall. Roven manned the wall, however he didn’t spot any drow in that dark night. His fellow soldiers kept on shooting, and as they would go down Roven would heal them. Although Roven did not prepare any spells that would help him identify or neutralize poison and quickly the tides turned against them. With ineffective archers, the trenches were overwhelmed. Roven spotted movement on the unmanned portions of the wall, but did not act. As grappling hooks came up over the side of the wall and attached to the parapets Roven scrambled to pull them free and send the drow falling back down the wall. The cavalry arrived, doing what they could, but the trenches stopped them from counter attacking the drow. And when they called, the gate of the city did not open.       
Roven and a partner ran for the gatehouse, fighting a few Drow along the way, and began to raise the gate by turning a heavy crank. When drow burst into the room, his partner lept at the drow knocking them to the ground, and Roven had to succeed a few athletics checks to open the gate for the cavalry. When the crank clicked into place Roven dived into the fight against the drow. Roven managed to pull one drow off his partner, but the drow tackled him. Roven was pushed back against a wall, the NPC tried to drag Roven in front of a window to push him out of it. On verge of plunging to his death, Roven managed to get a dagger under the drows armor, and killed him in a violent action of many swift stabs under the ribs. The partner had gotten on top of the other drow and bludgeoned him to death.   
The two left the gatehouse to meet up with the cavalry, only to be ambushed by a squadron of drow. The drow rushed at the two elf scouts, and the elves quickly tried to dodge attacks. When the scouts had a chance to fight back arrows flew all around them. The drow dropped dead, and the scouts were saved by a unit of elven archers. The city was set ablaze, soldiers focused on carry buckets of waters from the wells, and allowed the surviving drow to route away from the battlefield. The city of 20,000 suffered near twenty percent casualties and the army of 1,000 was dealt a deadly blow of over forty five percent casualty rate. The two scouts hunted, cooked, fed their fellow soldiers as well as citizens, and did their best to help rebuild over the next three days. Before they were called in with the other two scouts that were still uninjured and not missing in action. The scouts were assigned to two elite teams of soldiers, they would be there back up, and would pierce the heart of the drow empire. Their plan was to find and free the elves captured in the last fight and any other POWs they find. And it was, without a doubt, a suicide mission.
3. Party 1, the Elven Soldiers, Lyanu leads a squad of soldiers through the war. His regiment marched North towards the borders of the wood elf, unaided by wizards, unsupported by cavalry, and without any backup or battle plans. They were sent with the orders to hold a position. They arrived at a burned down village, dug trenches around it, and laid down palisades. The empire would do anything to defend their position, no matter how little the players understood their orders. Ranga Tempest arrived at this village turned into a fort, and befriended Lyanu. They were joined by Arthur Pendragon, a human war cleric. Aquilinus a High Elf Forge Cleric. Lovianus and Manius the scout brothers joined as well. When Ranga was tracked and the camp was raided in the night by goblinoids from the Badlands the party rose to the occasion. They fought off the goblin raiders, the bugbear enforcers that followed, and chased the hobgoblin captain through the fields of wheat that surrounded the village. When the hobgoblin reached the edge of the wheat fields he was cut down. An armored hobgoblin steps forward, black studded leather covers him, and he pulls forth a long, skinny sword. He claims that his men patrolled the border and ended these fights. Dragged the bandits back to the Badlands and imprisoned them. Lyanu’s party stood down. They allowed the armored hobgoblin, The Iron Shadow, to take the wounded leader of the bandits.
4. Party 2, the Militia of Tuvalu, Akamu led a party of Lo’Gosh the Goliath Fighter, Friseal the Eladrin Sorcerer, Toby the Tabaxi Archer, Ereshki the Blind Tortle Druid, and a young Tortle fighter named Ini. They brought with them Kevin, the hadrosaur, as a pack animal, and Akamu’s new companion the bloodhawk Crimson. They broke into the second hidden dungeon now controlled by the cult of Orcus. They had the element of surprise, but were surprised themselves. When they burst into the dungeon they are met by gnoll guards; one of them being a Fang of Yeenoghu. They fight the gnolls wondering where the mercenaries or cultists of Orcus could be. When one of their questions is answered. Sensing they are greatly outnumbered and outgunned the gnolls call for help. An ogre burts into the room and the players freak out fighting the giant-kin. Eventually they slay the beast. They fight through the dungeon killing more gnolls, ogres, and orcs. When low on health and spells they flee the dungeon with what valuables they collected. Akamu travelled around the island with his animals and Turtle friends. Friseal went to religious services with Toby worshipping the trickster Lord of Cats. Lo’Gosh works with the local fisherman putting his knowledge of sailing to good use. Akamu’s band found a druid grove. The grove was surrounded by a wall of trees, grown perfectly straight next to each other, forming a circle, and forming a perfect wall around whatever is inside. Akamu finds a rune on the outside, a classic puzzle that reads in Druidic, “Speak ‘friend’ and enter”. Akamu says friend in common. I, the DM, facepalm. Akamu then says friend in Druidic. And The roots of the trees curl up, revealing a stairwell down, that leads into the sunken druid grove. Inside a dryad awaits him. The dryad challenges him to a duel. They both cast shillelagh and swing at each other. Akamu’s staff bounces off the Dryad’s hardened skin, and the Dryads staff bounces off Akamu’s shell. Akamu lands a lucky blow and the dryad disengages. The dryad dodges in and out of the trees encircling the grove, hitting Akamu with each pass, but Akamu gets wise to this soon enough. Akamu prepares an attack and swings at the dryad as soon as the woman gets in range. The dryad is knocked to the ground, Akamu heals her, and helps her up. The dryad then gives him the training to join the Druid Circle of the Forest. To further his training Akamu must best the next guardian alone, an owlbear. Akamu even gives it a shot, winning initiative, and landing a solid blow. The owlbear then proceeds to down Akamu. Determined to grow stronger Akamu travels back to the city to gather his party and bring the fight back to the cult. 
5. Party 4, the Prisoners of War, Qiang went his separate way from Lyanu seeking other things in life. However he was captured by drow once he was separated. After weeks of being drugged, transferred, and restrained. He knew he had been taken underground, how far he could not tell, and when the drugs started to wear off he awoke in a temporary prison. He was being held with a number of other prisoners, their jailer was planning on transferring them to a large compound deeper into the underdark, but for now more prisoners were arriving from above. Four other soldiers are in the mix, and so Qiang naturally gravitates towards them. Albanus the Avariel Archer, a Star Elf Psyker known as 37, Zuberi the Tabaxi Mercenary fighting alongside them, and their enemy captured with them, Sigurd the Hobgoblin grappler. Albanus had a spider, 37 had silk rope, Zuberi had a gold coin, and Qiang had an arrow he had smuggled away.      
The group quickly devises a plan to escape with the use of 37’s telekinetic powers. Before following along with their plans they tried to gather support from the other prisoners. Qiang beat Ront the orc in an arm wrestling match gaining his support through superior show of strength. Qiang also made contact with Stool and agreed to assist him. Albanus made contact with a Drow man, an accused murderer named Sarith, and Albanus convinced him to clear his name by escaping.Before joining back up with the other soldiers he quickly got a dwarf woman named Eldeth to join the cause. Zuberi negotiated with the deep gnomes Topsy and Turvy eventually gaining their support by presenting a gold coin he had acquired. 37 had a different kind of luck when he noticed another player in the lock up. A drow woman keeping to herself, but 37 could already see the secret she carried. He made contact with her, learned she had been locked up for heresy, and that she would gladly escape to travel far from here. He promised that both of them would escape and left to join the others.   
The guards came in to serve their daily meal, the group ate up knowing it might be their last, and some final persuasion checks were made. Zuberi recruited Prince Derendil and Albanus recruited Jimjar. When the guards left the enclosure the plan started, 37 unlocked the gate with telekinesis, and Ront charged the gate with Zuberi and Qiang close behind. Ront slammed into the gate, the doors slammed into a guard, and the second guard rolled away. Ront began slamming his fists into the first guard. Zuberi wrestled the sword away from the first guard. Sigurd, who hadn’t done much in the session yet, charged at the second guard, picked her up, ran out to the walkway with her, and threw her over the edge. The guard grabbed the ledge with one hand, and began pulling herself back up. Qiang slid onto the walkway, and slammed an arrow into her hand that he had stolen from the guards since his capture. The guard fell to her death, slamming into the ground below, and we watched as spiders popped out of holes in the walls and ground and fought over the body.       
The group quickly moved to not lose the advantage of surprise they had. An alarm could go off at any moment. They came to an intersection, a ladder going up, and a set of stairs going down. They had the NPCs post up at the base of the ladder and then the players snuck down the staircase. Albanus and Zuberi scouted ahead of the group finding a guard tower with a male and female guard. Albanus threw his spider at the male guard, it bit the guard, and the guard quickly threw the spider off. The female guard slapped him over the head and told him to stay professional and keep watch. This moment where they were looking at each other instead of out at the prison the players attack. Zuberi ran up and slashed the female drow with the sword he had stolen. Albanus ran forward and tackled the male guard. The drow fought back but couldn’t quite land their mark. Qiang and Sigurd ran in, Qiang helped to take out the female drow, and Sigurd used his fists to end the other drows life.      
The group proceeded through the prison, clearing it room by room, and even made an ally in the lower priestess of the prison. They moved through the prison, finding an empty room and a chest they couldn’t open. Then in the next room they disturbed the prayers of a drow guard. The consort of the warden. Ront charged him, was thrown to the ground, and stabbed through the chest. Ront squealed. The rest of us charged. Qiang ran to one side, Zuberi ran to the otherside, and Sigurd tackled the guard. Sigurd held the man to the ground while the others stabbed him. Albanus and 37 shot at the guard with bows they had looted. The guard plunged his sword into Sigurd and tossed his unconscious body to the side. Zuberi and Albanus leapt to either side of the conflict. Alabnus casted cure wounds on Ront, and Zuberi used Lay on Hands on Sigurd. Ront swung a sword at the guard. The guard ducked under the sword, the sword clanged against the wall, and stone fell loose revealing the underdark outside. Sigurd once again tackled the guard. The guard flipped over, stabbed a sword through Sigurds chest, took his dagger off his corpse, and threw the dagger at Albanus. The group continued to lay attacks into the guard screaming for him to just go down. In case things went south, 37 travelled halfway up the ladder back up to the previous room, before firing a magic missile at the guard. The spell ended the guards life and the group breathed a sigh of relief. But Sigurd was not breathing. They said a few words for him. Tied him to the guard’s body. And let Ront break through the rest of the wall. They tied a rope off and grappled out of the room with the two corpses. They descended from the stalactite the rooms were in. Landing on the ground below they scouted and made plans to climb back up a different way to go back for all the NPCs they had left behind with the cleric of the prison.

Yeah. I could have been better about how I approached this issue and my comments and everything. I was just told that I am “The bad guy” and that I intended this post as a “Fuck you.”  And that I am a “White Knight”. And setting up strawmen And that sexism in gaming isn’t a real issue any more. And it’s all better now. And one guy even told me I was banned from ever playing in a game of his. (That one hurt...) and that I was attacking children or something. And that this post would burn down a round me. And that it is locked or removed. I dunno. 

But inside all of this about half the people who posted were glad I had even if they didn’t entirely agree with me. Two people thought it was an important enough topic to give even a bad guy two gold. (Thanks for that!)

This discussion is important. And it makes me angry. And it makes me hopeful. 

And I honestly don’t care about being a white knight (since when did wanting to stop sexism by raising its profile become something to be mocked) or a solid gold redditor. I am 45, male (some of you swing and missed on this) and am married and have been paying DND since i was 8 years old. I have two sons, 4 and 7. I finished a fourteen hour workday and spent my Substantial downtime starting this thread. 

The fact that so many of you, especially the women who chimed in, thanked me for this, I’d hope that the people who are so upset with me for one reason or another, could read their comments and thoughts and stop trying to minimize the experiences of women who are having to walk through razor grass to find safe, comfortable groups to play. It’s dumb. 

And every time we perpetuate these little stereotypes without stopping and thinking about how we fit into them, defend them and make them bigger, we are hurting our hobby and making space for intolerant idiots to be gatekeepers to our homes. 

Games haven’t been ruined by the GM’s girlfriend. They have been ruined by misperceptions, lack of communication, narrow-mindedness, lack of courage, inexperience and often straight up sexism. 

This post was a (ham handed ) attempt to bust up our assumptions about that trope but also how we handle conflict and complications within our games. 

The GM’s Girlfriend may be a real thing in a lot or even most cases. I dunno. But I can’t tell you that player responses to the mere perception of it do most of the damage to the group. 

Sorry I’ve not been perfect or even good. I hope the content of the whole conversation can be better than me. 
...

I hear SO much whining here and in other quarters about “The GM’s Girlfriend” and I really think it should stop. 

There are certainly occasions where the best friend, significant other or some sort of favored player gets extra perks and treated differently. 

But so often, the heat comes from incredibly insecure men and boys who have punishingly narrow views about how women should behave in Roleplaying games, and even if they should be in RPG’s at all. 

They had better be the coolest girl ever, with great “approved” ideas, superb patience, they have to flirt (because it’s not ReAL) and they had better not do anything weird that I am not used to. 

These women (especially women who aren’t steeped in D&amp;D and fantasy lore) are approached with such raw skepticism. God forbid your DM wants to introduce or include his girlfriend or wife into the game and she makes and unusual or not-perfectly-in-canon decision as her character! 

“She’s ruining the game!!!,” said Beer Belly McThunderFucker, the half orc barbarian, “It doesn’t make sense in the game world!”

Ultimately, it’s YOUR job as a player to engage other characters and find reasons to be engaged in the character and jump past the overly simple urge to treat another player or character like shit because you don’t like, agree with or find value in their choices. 

And ultimately, how on earth is this perception absolutely paralyzing a group of adult people so much that they can’t have a discreet, productive discussion about it and fix it if it really is an issue? Why does it become the cause of SO much consternation and most of the time this trope is repeated that there is no solution!!!! It’s hopeless! We are doomed!

You are not doomed. You are stuck. Because you aren’t communicating effectively with your DM. I mean if it is that bad?

99% of the whining about DMs on this subreddit are due to players being poor communicators, narrow-minded and incapable of engaging the unusual and wonderful opportunities new players, especially “The GM’s girlfriend”, bring to the table. 

Grow up. 

Update:
I am not going to be entirely calm about this. I am not going to make arguments that everyone is going to be happy with. I am not going to provide absolute proof and statistics backing up my point. I am not going to entertain claims that men are the real victims here and aren’t being heard. I am not going to do it. Other people here are going to do that. Fine. I didn’t start this thread to have a kumbaya campfire moment and protect everyone’s feelings. I wanted to start a conversation about this caustic phrase. 

I am pissed about this. And I’ve been pissed about it for a long time. I know many groups and places have made a lot of headway surrounding issues of gender equality in gaming. But there is a LOT of misogyny, anti-feminist, anti-woman crap in the craft still. 

I am suspicious that a lot of the MEN here feel like it’s not an issue any more. But most of the women I know who game don’t feel that way even though they are grateful for the groups they’ve found where gender isn’t an issue at all. They still feel unwelcome at new groups. And these are often the feelings of experienced, brilliant women in gaming. And I am sick of it. 

These knee-jerk responses trying to whittle down the issue and displace it and twist it and talk about the exceptions or claim it is a small problem...that’s why this issue is still an issue. 

Because the first urge most men who engage in or protect this shit is to deny it exists, or attack how I am saying it or find any way they can to not just acknowledge that people are doing bad things with it. 

Do some DMs give special favors to their girlfriends in games? Yes! But that’s not the point. The point is that it isn’t happening nearly as much as people make it out to be. And people use the perceived situation to cause further angst and chaos in their groups because of it. 

People need to grow up and start calling it “favoritism” instead of using yet another “no big deal” corrosive term that belittles the women and the game. 

It’s not this one thing. It’s a thousand of these little things. And it’s exhausting. It’s corrosive. Cumulatively it has a corrosive effect. It’s stupid. 

Make it easier for new players to be in the game. Be accommodating. Talk it out. 

My bigger concern than anything to do with the DM or the Girlfriend or favors is players not being able to communicate with other people about difficult situations when they value the situation. I hear a lot of people...a LOT of PLAYERS telling me why it’s not their fault or responsibility to learn to communicate with people about their frustrations when it comes to their DMs and gaming groups. Or that they have tried and nothing works. 

That’s not a coincidence. Because the “GM’s Girlfriend” trope doesn’t have a solution. It is the enemy. It is insurmountable until the GF leaves the game, we decide to suffer through it like torture or the group disbands. 

I haven’t had a serious argument in a D&amp;D game in twenty years or more. I’ve had games or groups I didn’t mesh with and only did a session or two. 

So yeah. 

Discuss the issue. But don’t expect me to agree with you or have you change my mind or be otherwise receptive about any of your misgivings about how I approached this or my overall point or any particular one. Just don’t have the patience or time for it. And it’s not my purpose.

I maybe the only one, but the whole idea of the Alchemist creating something bordering on complex life at 3rd level really bothered me. 

I know a few are bothered by the Artificer having a pet at all, esp when these abilities could easily just be given to the artificer themselves without the need to complicate an already complex class. I certainly understood their point, but the Artillerist Arcane Turrents really didn't bother me too much. I also understood the versatility that having the pets brought to the class. 

Then I realized what bothered me most, is that here we have this chemical throwing, potion brewing Alchemist, with this pet homunculus. When I envisioned a homunculus, for me two images come to mind; the artificial humans from Full Metal Alchemist and then there is the winged gremlin thing in the MM. There was just this dissonance there, of this gremlin creature just spitting up or regurgitating these salves or whatever. Yes, I know the lore behind the Homunculus. Oddly, I would have been fine with the Alchemist getting the Find Familiar spell, or some specialized version of it similar to what the Warlock gets. Why? because that would explained away the dissonance. 

Then I thought about it, well this class is about reflavoring, so what can I flavor the Homunculus as? I thought, so it needs to be Tiny (about the size of a cat or smaller) and needs to be flying. I thought about all the beast that the Find Familiar spell has, I even thought if the Artillerist got this thing, it would totally be an attempt to remake a Modrone that he or she once saw. 

Then it hit me, an OOZE! The Homunculus could be an Ooze.. yeah, may need to trade out its fly speed for a climb speed with Spider Climb, but it totally fits the stat block already with its immunities to poison and acid and, then its salves could just be apart of its Alchemical nature.  Oozes (seem to me anyways) to be a simpler life-form and you could easily flavor this pet as like a lab accident that blew up in the Alchemist face, but leaving behind the new Oozeling, or maybe even an unintended discovery or maybe some long lost alchemist formula or whatever. 

Yes, I realize that the backstory elements all fits fine for the gremlin-like homunculus as well, but to me, that kind of complex life with the average intelligence of a person, and a biology with a beating heart and all this complexity just comes too easily for me. There has to be a reason why wizards turn to necromancy and working with what is already there and how to reanimate it, over just simply brewing up complex creatures in a cauldron. To me, if WotC wants to make an Artificer Animancer subclass that seeks to animate creatures and constructs, then this gremlin like Homunculus and maybe even the Mechanical Servant from the previous artificer could fit in there. Otherwise, that Homunculus just doesn't work for the Alchemist for me.

TLDR: Reflavoring the Alchemist Homunculus as an Ooze instead of the gremlin-like Homunculus found in the MM solves the a huge bit of the cognitive dissonance I had with the Alchemist getting a pet that borders on complex life at 3rd level no-less. Yes, its meant to be reflavored, but to me, nothing solved the cognitive dissonance until I thought of reflavoring it as a pet Ooze.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: Late-night Rambling contained below.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey all,

I recently joined a game where I rolled up a divination wizard with all the knowledge skills marked for proficiency, and got my intelligence to +3 (highest possible with point buy) for a total of +5 on my checks to know things. My fantasy for this character was that she has a number of great professional proficiencies, skills, and a knowledge of arcane magic...

Or so I thought when I designed her anyway. Turns out the other players rolled for stats and got a ton of 18s and 20s in their stats, and even though none of them are INT main characters one of them has an 18 in Intelligence with Jack of All Trades buffing his knowledge checks to be equal with mine, and the other is an Eldritch Knight with 20 intelligence that, again, makes all his checks equal with mine. Whenever I want to make a check to know something, they tell the DM that their bonus is just as high as mine and roll as well, and often times one of them gets the better roll and the information instead of me. I know I should just be happy that we're succeeding period, but I'm not.

I'm posting now because honestly I let my discontent get the better of me last sunday and used a Portent roll to screw up one of their Knowledge checks so that I could finally know something as the knowledge based character, and it didn't really go over well with them. 

Don't really know what to do at this point, though I'm thinking a group conversation is coming. I just wanted to see what a bunch of anonymous folks thought before I started the dialogue, because I personally don't feel like an asshole for feeling badly about having a character who is being eclipsed in his ONE thing she was supposed to be able to do well, but I do kinda feel like an asshole for tripping up their character with Portent.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: AITA = am I the asshole&lt;/p&gt;

Things that have either no or ""minor""* impact on mechanics, but add fun and uniqueness to your PC or world.

Here are some examples to give you an idea of what I mean:

- In my worlds, teleport spells tend to rapidly displace the air/liquid wherever you appear, and so they're accompanied by a bright flash of light and popping sound. The exception to this is teleport spells that specify they use shadows - these are silent and instead of a flash of light, roiling shadows rise up out of the ambient darkness and ""eat"" you, travel like ephemeral black smoke, then vomit you up somewhere else. All teleport spells can also ignore line of effect, but have the risk of teleporting into a solid object like Dimension Door (just makes sense to me).

- I tend to make note of my players' favorite spells with ""destructive properties"" (Fireball being the classic example), and emphasize the property destruction when they're used. It can leave craters, set things on fire, destroy objects or terrain, and even leave behind difficult or damaging terrain (like little pools of acid from Vitriolic Sphere, or Gust of Wind shattering a window to make caltrops in its spot). To be clear the terrain is never directly under current enemies, but maybe something to use or avoid in later turns.

- I always have a caster's eyes glow a certain color when they're using divinations like Detect Magic, True Seeing, etc. Observant players can sometimes guess what their enemy is using from the color.

- Whenever thunder damage is dealt I describe it with cinematic noises - a boom, a crash, a grating cacophony for ongoing effects. It's always _loud_, though not louder than the sounds of the combat it's almost certainly taking place in (unless the spell specifies).

- This holds true for other damage types from spells or weapons too: fire can set things on fire, poison can be dripped into a cup of wine or w/e (as long as it's used within a few minutes!), force makes a heavy or piercing impact, cold can slowly freeze over something like a lock to make it more brittle (reducing the break DC slightly), etc. Necrotic damage I always describe as worsening existing wounds and sending black veins through flesh or making non-flesh decay/rust, psychic is a blinding migraine or terrible visions, radiant gives you the worst sunburn, veins of light, and makes you feel enervated (like laying by the pool too long).

- Stuff that uniquely harms true fiends (Protection from Evil, Banishment, Holy Word, a Devotion Paladin's Turn the Unholy, Hallow, etc.) still cause reactions for Tieflings, just not major mechanical ones. Rashes, headaches, a sickly feeling, etc.

- If a player gets smart with something like Unseen Servant, I'll allow them to do things like pour healing potions down an unconscious PC's throat or help with reloading a crossbow (extending the Loading property to two attacks instead of one).

- While they don't always get something useful, I have most animals a player talks to with Speak with Animals be positively disposed toward them (even if they're wild). It's not often you talk to a humanoid and they _actually understand you!_ How novel! My curiosity is overcoming my instinct to run/eat you!

- I let my players declare they're using a cantrip ""constantly"" if they wish (like Guidance, Resistance, or Shillelagh), but I make sure they roleplay it. You're keeping up Guidance through this whole dungeon? Ok, you annoy the crap out of your fellow party members with constant chanting, stealth is nigh-impossible, and whenever you'd be using two hands (like scaling a cliff) it won't apply. As long as they're ok with that, I just consider it a class feature.

- Healing magic is powerful and can re-knit deadly wounds, but sometimes someone can be ""too far gone"" even though they're saying (last) words. If someone's guts are hanging out, their chest is crushed, or they've lost all their blood, no amount of hp restoration'll save them from walking into the light. (This goes for PCs too - even if they're rolling death saves or failed three, they may partially perceive what's going on or get dramatic last words.)

- When a PC is raised from the dead they have a ""death mark"" - a scar or disfigurement indicative of how they were slain. Decapitated? You've got a whitish scar around your neck. Explosive Runes? Those are some nasty burns hiding under your clothes. Eaten? Are those...dragon tooth marks on your arm? I'd probably let a PC remove it with Regenerate, but they've all loved the idea so far. :P

- While you can ""detect"" an enemy's position despite being blind to them (from darkness, invisibility, etc.) if they are not attempting to hide, this has its limits. If the area's full of smoke and buildings and the enemy (or PC!) is 600 feet away pelting you with their longbow and then moving between said buildings...yeah that's gonna be a no for me dawg. Find cover!

- Not all spell scrolls or verbal components are solely in Draconic. Many other ancient languages - Infernal, Celestial, Abyssal, Giant, Elven, Dwarven, and more - were used in the origins of certain spells, so a PC with one or more of these languages may be able to decipher _part_ of a spell's incantation and guess at its purpose.

* ""Minor"" is of course up to interpretation. To be clear I know RAW (like spells that specify ""creatures"" not damaging objects) and am not interested in it for this post.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious to hear what sorts of &amp;quot;signatures&amp;quot; you add to your spells and other features (either as player or as a DM.) Things that have either no or &amp;quot;minor&amp;quot;* impact on mechanics, but add fun and uniqueness to your PC or world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples to give you an idea of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my worlds, teleport spells tend to rapidly displace the air/liquid wherever you appear, and so they&amp;#39;re accompanied by a bright flash of light and popping sound. The exception to this is teleport spells that specify they use shadows - these are silent and instead of a flash of light, roiling shadows rise up out of the ambient darkness and &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; you, travel like ephemeral black smoke, then vomit you up somewhere else. All teleport spells can also ignore line of effect, but have the risk of teleporting into a solid object like Dimension Door (just makes sense to me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to make note of my players&amp;#39; favorite spells with &amp;quot;destructive properties&amp;quot; (Fireball being the classic example), and emphasize the property destruction when they&amp;#39;re used. It can leave craters, set things on fire, destroy objects or terrain, and even leave behind difficult or damaging terrain (like little pools of acid from Vitriolic Sphere, or Gust of Wind shattering a window to make caltrops in its spot). To be clear the terrain is never directly under current enemies, but maybe something to use or avoid in later turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always have a caster&amp;#39;s eyes glow a certain color when they&amp;#39;re using divinations like Detect Magic, True Seeing, etc. Observant players can sometimes guess what their enemy is using from the color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever thunder damage is dealt I describe it with cinematic noises - a boom, a crash, a grating cacophony for ongoing effects. It&amp;#39;s always &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt;, though not louder than the sounds of the combat it&amp;#39;s almost certainly taking place in (unless the spell specifies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This holds true for other damage types from spells or weapons too: fire can set things on fire, poison can be dripped into a cup of wine or w/e (as long as it&amp;#39;s used within a few minutes!), force makes a heavy or piercing impact, cold can slowly freeze over something like a lock to make it more brittle (reducing the break DC slightly), etc. Necrotic damage I always describe as worsening existing wounds and sending black veins through flesh or making non-flesh decay/rust, psychic is a blinding migraine or terrible visions, radiant gives you the worst sunburn, veins of light, and makes you feel enervated (like laying by the pool too long).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff that uniquely harms true fiends (Protection from Evil, Banishment, Holy Word, a Devotion Paladin&amp;#39;s Turn the Unholy, Hallow, etc.) still cause reactions for Tieflings, just not major mechanical ones. Rashes, headaches, a sickly feeling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a player gets smart with something like Unseen Servant, I&amp;#39;ll allow them to do things like pour healing potions down an unconscious PC&amp;#39;s throat or help with reloading a crossbow (extending the Loading property to two attacks instead of one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they don&amp;#39;t always get something useful, I have most animals a player talks to with Speak with Animals be positively disposed toward them (even if they&amp;#39;re wild). It&amp;#39;s not often you talk to a humanoid and they &lt;em&gt;actually understand you!&lt;/em&gt; How novel! My curiosity is overcoming my instinct to run/eat you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I let my players declare they&amp;#39;re using a cantrip &amp;quot;constantly&amp;quot; if they wish (like Guidance, Resistance, or Shillelagh), but I make sure they roleplay it. You&amp;#39;re keeping up Guidance through this whole dungeon? Ok, you annoy the crap out of your fellow party members with constant chanting, stealth is nigh-impossible, and whenever you&amp;#39;d be using two hands (like scaling a cliff) it won&amp;#39;t apply.

&amp;#x200B;

Step one, race. I took out the PHB and showed her the pictures for: Human, Half-Elf, Tiefling and Halfling and let her pick. She went Halfling, and I made it a Lightfoot. Step one down.

&amp;#x200B;

Step two, I needed a Patron. I left Hexblade off, and let her pick between Devil (Fiend), Fairy (Fey), Genie (GoO), Unicorn (Celestial), Zombie (Undying). She went with Unicorn, so here comes a Celestial Tomelock!

So Background I outlined a couple options I felt I could write decent backstory for and let her pick. Really, she got the choice between a Pirate (Sailor w/ variant rule) and Princess (Noble). I knew where this was going, and she did not disappoint by going Princess.

&amp;#x200B;

As for name, I now knew she was a Princess, so she's got a title. And my little girl gave me the name ""Rainbowface"". So there we go.

I would like to beg for your patience when reading this question. The question I have in mind is if there is anything preventing me from doing this, RAW RAI, or opinion based. That said, this post will be about Silent Image, the first level Illusion spell. Let's have a look at it.  


&gt;Silent Image  
&gt;  
&gt;1st level illusion. (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)  
&gt;  
&gt;Casting Time  
&gt;  
&gt;1 action  
&gt;  
&gt;Range  
&gt;  
&gt;60 feet  
&gt;  
&gt;Components  
&gt;  
&gt;V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
&gt;  
&gt;Duration  
&gt;  
&gt;Concentration, up to 10 minutes  
&gt;  
&gt;Description  
&gt;  
&gt;You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.  
&gt;  
&gt;(PHB 276)  


Have you watched the first Ironman film? Was it cool seeing the suit's HUD light up enemies and display their combat relative information in real time? I want to grant that feeling/benefit to my party's long range specialist by creating a visual phenomenon that takes the form of the lengthwise half-perimeter of a cylinder 15 feet tall, and maybe a little over 5 feet wide.   


What it does is act as a one way screen for the archer in question to aid her long range capabilities (to at least cancel out that disadvantage at long range). It has magnifying capabilities, can highlight creatures in red, provide night vision, provide aim assistance that projects the archer's arrow's possible trajectory, taking into account the wind speed, weight of the projectile, etc.  


Is there anything stopping me from doing this (besides DM fiat)?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings dndnext,  &lt;/p&gt;

&gt; **~~Wand~~ *Weapon* Prototype:** By 6th level, you now regulalry experiment with channeling different types of magic through ~~wands~~ *your weapons*. Whenever you finish a long rest and your ~~woodcarver's~~ tools are with you, you can touch a *crossbow, gun or* nonmagical, wooden wand and turn it into a magic item. When you do so, you invest it with one *damaging* artificer cantrip of your choice - even one you don't know - that has a casting time of 1 action. As an action you can cause the magic ~~wand~~ *weapon* to produce the cantrip, using your spellcasting ability modifier (other creatues are unable to use the ~~wand's~~ *weapons* magic). *The weapon also becomes a spellcasting focus for you.* The ~~wand~~ weapon loses this magic when you finish your next long rest. Any damage roll you make for a cantrip in the ~~wand~~ *weapon* gains a bonus equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). When you rach lv14 in this class, you can invest the ~~wand~~ *weapon* with two *damaging* cantrips at the end of a long rest.

What we get from this is a very flavorful artillerist artificer that really lives up to his archetype by combining his skill and ingenuity by combining weapons with his latent magic. Just think about it, your enemies are immune to bolts? Shoot a ray of frost out of your gun. Multiple enemies attacking you? How about launching a few acid splash bombs? Enemy threatens you in melee? How about smashing your gun into his face while shocking grasp'ing him. Enemy tries to run away from you? Rope shot him with thorn whip. The flavour and applications you gain from this is just so awesome that it just begs you to build an artificer. 

Note: I mostly limited the feat to damaging cantrips so that you don't get weird magical mending crossbows. It is a slight nerf yes, but with 2+2 cantrips available at lv6 and the lv10 ability to swap cantrips, it shouldn't be too hard of a nerf. If you don't like this nerf, then just leave it out and you will only get a very flavourful upgrade to your feat. If the nerf isn't hard enough for you and you dislike trick shots like thorn whip, consider limiting it to ranged attack rolls or ranged saving throws.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;del&gt;Wand&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;Weapon&lt;/em&gt; Prototype:&lt;/strong&gt; By 6th level, you now regulalry experiment with channeling different types of magic through &lt;del&gt;wands&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;your weapons&lt;/em&gt;. Whenever you finish a long rest and your &lt;del&gt;woodcarver&amp;#39;s&lt;/del&gt; tools are with you, you can touch a &lt;em&gt;crossbow, gun or&lt;/em&gt; nonmagical, wooden wand and turn it into a magic item. When you do so, you invest it with one &lt;em&gt;damaging&lt;/em&gt; artificer cantrip of your choice - even one you don&amp;#39;t know - that has a casting time of 1 action. As an action you can cause the magic &lt;del&gt;wand&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;weapon&lt;/em&gt; to produce the cantrip, using your spellcasting ability modifier (other creatues are unable to use the &lt;del&gt;wand&amp;#39;s&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;weapons&lt;/em&gt; magic). &lt;em&gt;The weapon also becomes a spellcasting focus for you.&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;del&gt;wand&lt;/del&gt; weapon loses this magic when you finish your next long rest. Any damage roll you make for a cantrip in the &lt;del&gt;wand&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;weapon&lt;/em&gt; gains a bonus equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). When you rach lv14 in this class, you can invest the &lt;del&gt;wand&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;weapon&lt;/em&gt; with two &lt;em&gt;damaging&lt;/em&gt; cantrips at the end of a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;

So far here are my ideas and also this is optimised around being a good fighter or barbarian stand in so this is gunna feel heavily martial based

&amp;#x200B;

Multiclassing

Barbarian 1 - good for the quick dip of AC and rage, doesn't impact CR of creatures that muchBarbarian 3 - good for more rages and also subclass abilities, impacts CR by one whole stepBarbarian 5 - barbarian 3's bonuses with extra attack, impacts CR of creatures by quite a large amount but extra attack makes you deal much more damage than most moon druids.

Monk 1 - good for AC, the boost can make high dex forms good tanks and like barb 1 it's not impactful on CRMonk 5 - you get extra attack along with things like deflect missile and slow fall but I think this is less valuble than barbarian 5 from the extra bonuses beyond extra attack not being able to compete with barbarian's extra bonuses

Rogue 1 - quick 1st level dip is good for grappling

Barbarian *and* Monk? - this feels like a wildcard and a big one but at the same time think about how big a combo of monk's AC and barb's rage could be. That said dex forms don't work well with rage since to get the full benefits you need to be using strength so you need to be quite specific about what wildshape you choose

&amp;#x200B;

Feats

Tavern Brawler - good for if your DM allows you to use it with wildshape's natural weapons from how useful grappling in wildshape can be (size is one good example) but if your DM doesn't allow this to be used in wildshape then don't bother.

Sentinel - this should be obvious, with how well this works at keeping enemies on you there isn't much else needed

War caster - this is pretty good on most moon druids but I am unsure about it being useful for druid/barbs, mainly from how you can just rage and use your spell slots on healing (which I will say is a very optimal strategy.) That said if you are not taking a level in barb then this is very good

&amp;#x200B;

Spells

Create Bonfire - cast this, then just hold them onto the fire while attacking them with your normal attacks for pretty good damage.

Enhance ability - bull's strength gives you a bonus similar to rage so if you are out of rages this is a good friend

Conjure animals - what's better than one huge ass bear? A trio of them. Very good for controlling the battlefield with how you can have multiple meat shields at once.

Barkskin - while this is very good for pure druids, druid/barbs or especially druid/monks are gunna make this just a +2 AC boost at best but that is still pretty good but maybe not as good as some of the other spells

Healing Spirit - 10d6 healing for you and your friends! This is so broken that no explanation is needed

Things started slow and not much progress was made, and I've been experiencing issues with the DM (seems to be new) being extremely rail-roading.

To give context, we've just started, and after having all of our items stolen except for our weapons, armor, and arcane focuses, we arrived to the Death House mini-quest. For the sake of this, the party is me, Greg, Sam, and Max. Myself, Greg, and Sam had walked into the house, to which the doors slammed behind us, leaving Max behind while he was standing outside talking to locals. This is a basic summary of the ""roleplaying"" we've had over the past two days:

&gt;DM: ""The doors slam behind you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""I'd like to start banging on the doors and yelling for Max.""  
&gt;  
&gt;DM: ""He doesn't hear anything, the doors seem to block your screams.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""I'm going to pick the lock.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""There is no lock""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Is there a keyhole?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Can I see Max through the keyhole?'  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes but he's surrounded in a fuzzy black aura.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Okay, well I'm going to cast Mage Hand in front of him and get his attention.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Your spell doesn't go through the door.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'm going to move into the next room, what's there?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""A fire place, a stair well, and a double door ahead.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'm going to put a torch in the fire place and make smoke come out the top of the chimney for Max to notice.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""There's already a fire in the fireplace.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""How big is the fire place?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's small.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Well I'm size class small, so I'm gonna try to get in there. First I'm gonna try to remove the torch and currently burning wood.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""It burns you for 2 fire damage.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I can't use my dagger or a nearby fire poker?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""You don't see any fire pokers nearby.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""If we go to the fireplace and place Greg's shield on top of it, can Sam's raven fly out of the chimney and not die?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""You can try that. You will be able to stop the flames killing the bird.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""...so the bird will \*\*not\*\* die.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes the bird will be safe.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Okay, we do that then. I'll pull Greg's shield out with a pair of pliers so I don't burn my hands either.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The bird flies out of the chimney and to Max.""

Now, of course, Max is questioning if he would understand why we're sending the bird to notify him, but i just wanted to ask if I'm being the asshole in this situation for absolutely hating this. This has been the entire campaign for two days now because the DM refuses to just allow Max to know we are trapped. Death House doesn't have *any* of these elements, and to me it's ridiculous.

Part of me is saying leave and the current group of irl friends I DM for every week says to do so as well. Personally, I need a good fix of DnD for when I'm not busy DMing and when we have to skip weeks due to scheduling, so I can probably find another game to join and enjoy.

Another part of me though knows how hard DMing is and this guy seems to be a newbie to the DMing scene. I know first hand that people up and leaving or saying ""I don't want to play with you because you don't DM correctly"" destroys peoples' motivation and can ruin their future as successful and great DMs. I think I'm going to message him tonight and tell him how I feel about the game (since that's always the most mature way to handle this sort of thing) and try to give him some pointers as well. If he keeps doing these unnecessary railroads or just doesn't try to improve (because personally this seems like a massive need to improve) then I should just leave.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well I&amp;#39;m size class small, so I&amp;#39;m gonna try to get in there. First I&amp;#39;m gonna try to remove the torch and currently burning wood.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It burns you for 2 fire damage.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t use my dagger or a nearby fire poker?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t see any fire pokers nearby.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we go to the fireplace and place Greg&amp;#39;s shield on top of it, can Sam&amp;#39;s raven fly out of the chimney and not die?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can try that. You will be able to stop the flames killing the bird.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...so the bird will **not** die.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes the bird will be safe.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, we do that then. I&amp;#39;ll pull Greg&amp;#39;s shield out with a pair of pliers so I don&amp;#39;t burn my hands either.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The bird flies out of the chimney and to Max.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, Max is questioning if he would understand why we&amp;#39;re sending the bird to notify him, but i just wanted to ask if I&amp;#39;m being the asshole in this situation for absolutely hating this. This has been the entire campaign for two days now because the DM refuses to just allow Max to know we are trapped. Death House doesn&amp;#39;t have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these elements, and to me it&amp;#39;s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me is saying leave and the current group of irl friends I DM for every week says to do so as well. Personally, I need a good fix of DnD for when I&amp;#39;m not busy DMing and when we have to skip weeks due to scheduling, so I can probably find another game to join and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of me though knows how hard DMing is and this guy seems to be a newbie to the DMing scene. I know first hand that people up and leaving or saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to play with you because you don&amp;#39;t DM correctly&amp;quot; destroys peoples&amp;#39; motivation and can ruin their future as successful and great DMs. I think I&amp;#39;m going to message him tonight and tell him how I feel about the game (since that&amp;#39;s always the most mature way to handle this sort of thing) and try to give him some pointers as well. If he keeps doing these unnecessary railroads or just doesn&amp;#39;t try to improve (because personally this seems like a massive need to improve) then I should just leave. What do you all think?&lt;/p&gt;

They had made a deal with the nothic to just chill out and let them pass in exchange for feeding it. After that, the party managed to deal with Iarno pretty handily after finding the secret passage to his room through the storage room. They then knocked him out and stowed him away in the storage room by the cavern (with the nothic) while they went and dealt with the rest of the dungeon. They proceeded to clear the dungeon, but instead of heading back to grab Iarno, they decided to take a short rest in one of the other dungeon rooms. Giving the nothic a hour alone with Iarno.

After some deliberation, and rolling some dice to see what would happen, the party returned to find an empty storehouse with some tracks leading outside. Some survival checks later, they deduced that the nothic had taken the unconscious wizard and left. They tracked it outside into the woods, but were unable to push forward in tracking it through the woods. The party really enjoyed this twist, but....

So he has had a lot of opportunity to experiment with personas, but also hasnt strictly needed them for most things.

My most casual persona is that of a young but tall male human with pale, freckled skin, green eyes, curly brown hair, and a close cut beard, named Rodom Kurkav. He tends to be more upbeat, and has a thunderous, earnest, almost contagious laugh that leaves him red faced and short of breath. He's the one I go to whenever I need to interact with other races, or just while I go about my day whenever Im in a good mood.

My persona for formal affairs is associated with my family, and mostly used in my home village: a stout, narrow-faced male half-elf, with brown eyes, a copperish skin tone and black hair, named Ayas. My particular take on him has a more pronounced chin than the rest of my family, and longer hair. This persona tends towards short, polite sentences. When I feel awkward or uncomfortable, sometimes my nose will become more narrow and pointed, like Ayas'.

Then I have a persona for playing music, which is a thin, visibly aged, female mountain dwarf with bright blue eyes and waist-length black braided hair, named Jastebyrn. She has a little bit of a tortured artist thing going on, and I tend to use her to express and process sorrow, anger, disappointment: those kinds of emotions.

Then there was the persona I was given during my apprenticeship as an artificer. This one is a small, youthful female half-elf with moon elf esque alabaster skin and shoulder-length blue-black hair, named Vela. I turn into her when I'm changing my spell list, crafting an item, or otherwise hard at work on anything intellectual in nature.

My last persona is much more... personal. Nix is married, and as an expression of their affection, he and his spouse, Fie, created a shared persona, using their favorite aspects of each other's personas. The resulting persona, named Elyn, is a thin female human with pale, freckled skin and long straight red hair who loves, loves, loves to cook. Like, Elyn is my divergent persona, so we're talking full expertise in cooks' utensils here. Nobody else has seen this persona, and, despite being the cook in the party, I refuse to use Elyn, because I dont want anybody else to see her. Sometimes I will turn into her just before bed, when I dont think anybody else is awake, and Im thinking about Fie. Im looking forward to being wrong sometime.

""As you approach Nix's bed, you notice that the person in that bed is a young, red-haired woman you've never seen before, looking at a locket.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, I do not want to min/max a character. As long as it plays well, I'm cool with it. The background of the character is much more important to me for the build. However, let's get into my question.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to play a variant human (extra feat) tomelock (warlock with tome of secrets) but based on my character background I might want to involve a bard and multiclass. However, I want most levels in Warlock. So here are my options, I think:

&amp;#x200B;

I can take 1 lvl in bard and X lvls in Warlock. I would do this for bardic inspiration, healing word, viscous mockery and another lvl 1 spell. Now bardic inspiration, healing word, message and viscous mockery would really flavor up the character. I also don't know which lvl 1 spell from the bard I would additionally get...

However, I could also use the extra feat from variant human to get Magic Initiate to learn viscous mockery, message and healing word. I won't get bardic inspiration however and the extra lvl 1 bardic spell. Also, I can cast healing word only once per long rest. But then I can be a pure warlock.

&amp;#x200B;

So, any advice :-) ? Magic Initiate or 1 lvl in bard? Or maybe 2 or 3 lvls in bard? I know most do 2 lvls in Warlock and X in Bard, but that is not my aim.

First off, let's define what Intelligence is. It's the textbook example of knowledge, pun intended. You are told things, you remember them, and your ability to remember and apply things you are told to the real world is represented by your Intelligence. Obviously, this is why wizards use this as their casting stat.

Jumping forward a little, you have Charisma. It is a measure of your force of personality, your willpower, your... everything that makes you, you. The more YOU there is, the more Charisma you have. This is why Sorcerers and Paladins work off Charisma, because they are using their own personal presence to will powerful magic into being. (And Warlocks should be Int casters. fite me IRL)

However, we also have Wisdom. If Intelligence is what you know, and Charisma is what you are, what's left? It's not a measure of your willpower, because that's already covered by your Charisma. Turns out, your brain does a lot of shit besides remembering stuff. It decodes your senses, controls your body's natural processes, and even suppresses your lizard brain when necessary. Attention span, self-control... that is all measured by your Wisdom.

When you make a Perception check, your Wisdom is representing how finely tuned your senses are. When you roll a Wisdom save to resist Hold Person, your Wisdom is representing the fine control your brain has over your body. And when you make a save against Crown of Madness, that's your Wisdom representing your ability to ignore your screaming lizard brain that tells you to smash everyone around you.

(I've been wanting to make this comparison to all the other spells in D&amp;D 5e, but I haven't found a good list of spells by save yet.)

This also helps explain why monks are so Wisdom heavy. And it speaks to a big difference between clerics and paladins. Clerics require study and self-reflection to draw upon their powers. They are generally the servants of their gods, not their enforcers. Druids, on the same token, are servants of nature. Both clerics and druids are conduits for divine power, and it comes through a very deep understanding and acceptance of their place in the metaphysical world.

I have a few other ways to conceptualize these ideas that I like:

Physiologically, your Intelligence covers everything in your prefrontal cortex. Wisdom covers everything in the rest of your brain. And Charisma covers everything that can't be directly attributed to brain function. Your soul, if you will.

In general, Intelligence covers things you can learn on your own (observation, experiment) as well as things you can be taught. Wisdom can be learned, but not taught. And Charisma can neither be learned nor taught. 

I'm not saying this is the most objectively accurate description of Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma, and I'm aware it goes against some of the more niggly details of the flavor text in the rulebooks, but it's the one that seems the most internally consistent to me, in terms of saving throw choices, ability-skill pairings, class ability bonuses, etc.

I've been DMing for 3 1/2 years straight. The only breaks I had were:

1. I have been a player for a total of two one-shots
2. I have been a player for a couple weeks into a new campaign twice (So basically 3-5 sessions in both situations) before I had to take over as DM. One had real life issues, the other was a toxic powergaming DM that the party was sick of.
3. I do get to play some Saturdays for a separate campaign as of late.

I am going to basically be handing over the reins of DM to a new person, hopefully indefinitely--either they'll keep DMing or someone else will take over when *they* get tired like I am.

And honestly? I'm nervous as hell about it. The guy's fairly new to 5e, and watching him DM for the Saturday group, he doesn't seem to really think everything through. I see so many things that just terrify me. What's worse, I've tried sending him feedback (He has said he wants it), and I don't get any acknowledgement about it. Not even a ""Trystt27, you're being annoying, shut up"" or something lol. But at the same time, I know I have to let him DM--it's exhausting me beyond compare, and I long to tell my own story as a player character, rather than tell everyone else's story.

Reflecting on my behavior during his Saturday campaigns, I find that I'm struggling to simply give up control as DM. Because as much as I'm so, so tired of DMing, I love the control I have over what is going on.

I am afraid that the campaign (a module) will suffer if someone else is doing it. I'm afraid that my constructive criticism (and I always, always strive to be constructive with any of my concerns) about his DMing is falling on deaf ears. As much as I want to be a player character for just one whole campaign, one solid campaign, I am afraid that giving up the reins will just ruin everything.

**What advice or words of encouragement would you give for someone in my shoes? What can I do to assuage my fears so that I can comfortably let someone else DM without me looking over their shoulder every waking moment?** I really don't want to be that player that is correcting the DM or telling him how he should be doing something (unless he asks, of course--he is fairly new to 5e). I don't want to be worrying every second of the campaign that something isn't being done well, or done how I would do it, or whatever.

I hope I'm not coming across as a dick or anything. I'm just noticing that I am regularly dissatisfied with his Saturday campaign (to the point I almost don't want to be a part of it), and while with this campaign he would be following a module, I want to try and get myself into a better mindset, or do something to make me feel more confident in him. Because I don't want to have another scenario where I end up having to DM again, or where I am feeling like I am not enjoying the experience. I suppose the best thing I can say is that I've been behind the screen so long, I literally don't know how to function and be at ease without being behind it and in control.

I also hope this makes sense. It's a little late and I'm out of it, but it's also sort of a stream of consciousness/venting thing. Despite all of that, I do want to be put at ease that all of this is going to turn out alright somehow, and I'd like to take steps to ensure that.

EDIT: To be a little more clear: I am noticing that I am having difficulties giving up control, and I understand that is a problem. I am here to look for advice on how to let go on this matter. Stories of Forever DMs finally getting to have someone else DM and how that went for them. I want to be a supportive player for this new DM, but I realize my mindset is not healthy because I am afraid of what the future will hold--because either way, he gets to DM.

In the world that I made, five hundred years in the past, Bahamut and Tiamat had an immense battle. This battle was called the decimation and that caused the world to split apart. So continents became islands, a most surrounded parts of the world, and a terrible storm took over one of the seas. During this Great War there was a hero named Elidar. He was a paladin and served Bahamut and help win the war. He disappeared, but became a recognized hero. Essentially a King Arthur. Fast forward to the campaign, a criminal organization called the Crimson Order and their leaders the five generals became a full blown army and stole an artifact called the god slayer. The players soon discovered there was a leader named the crimson lord and he was trying to kill the gods and became the one god himself. But it was soon revealed that the crimson lord was the great hero Elidar and revealed that he blamed the gods for destroying his life, disrupting his family life and just causing chaos. So he thought a world with one god would be better.

Now that is covered what made me happy was how the players discovered the plot twist. It was not explained to them, they figured it out in a key moment, cause I had left some red herrings for the identity of the villain. The players had figured it when they were trying to protect a magical seal that kept Tiamat trapped. They followed the crimson lord down to an old shrine that Elidar had built to protect the seal. The golem guarding it recognized the Crimson lord as master and let him pass. The players fought the golem, after which the the golem said the master had come. And then there was a confrontation with the big bad, and then he escaped. After mulling it they realized who it was and there was a stunned silence as none of them saw it coming.

It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.  
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like possession offers the initial saving throw to resist it, but once possessed, there's no opportunity to save out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Protection from Evil and Good States:

* Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.  
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. **The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.** **If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.**

Why does protection from good and evil give you advantage on a saving throw against possession while you are already possessed, if possession doesn't offer you any end of turn saves?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possession (Recharge 6).&lt;/em&gt; One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.

Story background: One of my players found a tattoo shop that does magic tattoos, they had 8 tattoo options and one was a tattoo of a question mark so she decided to get that. The tattoo can be activated once a day to get a random effect. As a DM, I created a d100 effects table that has general magic effects and a few that fits better with the character. The first roll she did for it was a 4 which magically made her pregnant. I then rolled to see how many weeks pregnant she was I got 36 (2d20 19+17).

Player background: She is a wood elf (barbarian) that was abandoned by her parents when she a baby and found by an orc tribe. She spent her her live so far living with this tribe. The tribe worships Luthic (orc deity of fertility, medicine, females and servitude). The tribes leaders are all female orcs.

I need help coming up with options for what the baby may be and when she goes back to her tribe, if she or the baby will be worshipped. Also her blood/bodily fluids are poisonous from a previous encounter. 

Thanks!

If I'm wrong please correct me, but if I'm right, our party just entered this legendary 1% of parties.

&amp;#x200B;

I was the DM for this amazing adventure, with the players Gren, Scout, Verin and Jon (with temporary members Sarah, Donna and Tleloc voice of Tleloc). They have braved many adventures, and survived the many obstacles I threw in their way. We learned a bunch of important lessons, mostly regarding CR being a joke if you do not follow the suggested amount of encounters per day (such as beating octuple deadly encounters). We settled the debate between single classing or multi classing: both are capable of impressive feats of strength. And we had tons of fun in these two years.

&amp;#x200B;

The campaign world was homebrew, and heavily inspired by MtG, including fan favourite characters and items. The story follows the party stranding on the beach of the continent as they were travelling towards the ""grand fair"", a massive fair where people could share ideas, items, and money. They then travelled through the mountains towards this great city (lvls 1-4).

Afterwards, they decided to join a group of paladins, knights and clerics in their mission of trying to resettle an undead-infested swamp (we are dutch after all, resettling swamps is kind of our thing). After kicking out many of the necromancers from the base of operations, a purge of undead and mages started, along with obtaining hints about the overarching plot that would be later revealed. When they were done, the overarching plot got revealed, and a titanic ancient dragon came back to this plane of existence to reclaim it for himself (lvls 5-8).

The party learned of many magic items that were originally crafted when this grand villain was here the first time. Orbs of protection, swords that could slay any enemy, great siege weapons, and a monstrous dragon that could rival his power. They got the orbs, met a god, got her blessing in the great ""get a god's blessing tournament"" on the celestial mountain, then moved to the jungle to free the swords, each time finding that they were just in time as the villain's henchmen were always on their tail. They regained the siege weapons from the flying castles, and slayed all DnD's greatest monsters (beholders, mind flayers, dinosaurs, sphinxes, etc). Throughout these adventures, volo's guide to monsters was released, extending my bestiary with fun monsters like the elder brain (lvl 9-11) .

Lastly, the party went to find the dragon. They heard they needed to become the new ""defenders of the forge"", and that that was a position that could only be obtained by beating the former ""defenders of the forge"", a group of dragons. So they did. A 12th level party fighting an ancient dragon, no problem. After fighting the dragon, they cut of its head, leading all its kobold minions to worship the party instead of their old master. This lead them to start and train their roman style army of kobolds to prepare for the upcoming siege, as the villain had holed himself up inside the large central city. Then, a later dragon they slayed had control of one of the largest trade cities in the region, so they captured that, and made it their new base of operations. Then, they spoke to the keepers of the dragon and the dragon herself, naming her ""big momma"". They also got themselves a set of cool dragon mounts. (lvls 12-15)

Then they took an unexpected b-line, hunting and slaying a lich that was rumored to have a large stash of magic items to find something to protect themselves from the villain's mind controlling magic. (lvls 16-17)

Then the siege began. They brought their new kobold army (now hundreds of kobolds large) and laid siege to the city, doing continuous incursions with hit-and-run tactics, constantly trying to outsmart the villain. They met face to face a couple of times, beat his commanders, and found an extremely powerful artifact, a bride's veil made of chain mail. This was super cursed, sentient and evil, but it did help them beat the dragon later. Then, the veil took control over the paladin, who had to fight himself as a ghost version of himself, along the rest of the party, after which he revivified himself.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, these two years were pretty wild. A big thanks to the party, the community for advice, and WotC for the great game. It was a blast. See you in the next campaign.

Yours truly,

the dungeon master

It's basically just a 2nd-level Find Familiar that lets you summon three familiars for an hour with concentration. It seems balanced enough, but as soon as I saw that it was on the Warlock spell list, I got all kinds of ideas.

Firstly, Pact of the Chain warlocks can choose creatures other than the normal list of beasts, specifically an [imp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/imp), [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon), [quasit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit), or [sprite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sprite). Now, at first glance, I would assume there's nothing wrong with allowing Flock of Familiars to summon three of any of these. The spell does say specifically that ""each familiar uses the same rules and options for a familiar conjured by the find familiar spell"" which should include Pact of the Chain, right? Anyone agree or disagree?

But here's the fun part: Pact of the Chain Warlocks can forgo one attack to allow their familiar to attack, but with this spell, now I have *three* familiars. Of course, you get an extra familiar for each spell level, so at level 5, I have four familiars; at level 7, I have five familiars. So, let's say I choose to do this in a game where you're DMing. Would you allow me to:

A) Have just one of my familiars attack  
B) Have one of my familiars attack per each attack I forgo, assuming I have an extra attack  
C) Have all of my familiars attack either at the cost of one attack or the whole action

And does the ruling on the first question change your opinion on the second one?

So I wanted to tell about the session that disbanded the last group I played with.

Back during my senior year in High School a few friends of mine had a small group that varied every week, some weeks it would be four, on some days it would be three, and on the rare occasions there would be five. I had played with them for about half a year or so and sometime in April, our DM had thought that we should do The Curse of Strahd, I was excited to hear this because the way he described it was ""more role playing than action."" He then said that he wanted to have a session that consisted of a party of six or seven players and i was on board with this.

During the next week he said that he was going to make restrictions and proceeded to list them off: Your character has to be either Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or Neutral Good; Use only classes and sub classes from The Player Handbook and use only races from The Player Handbook. I could understand these restrictions somewhat, I mean this was a big group and wanted to make it easier for both him and some of the new players he was inviting. The group of people that were suppose to show up to this session were: The DM's girlfriend, his girlfriend's friend, his girlfriend's friend's boyfriend, two of the DM's friends who have played a few times, and myself.

Because of this group of people the DM decided to reserve classes to certain players. One of his friends always played a halfling bard (in fact it was always the same one, but we actually liked his character and he was always working so he never really got to play him), both the DM's girlfriend, his girlfriend's friend were playing as clerics, the DM reserved his girlfriend's friend's boyfriend both Fighter and Barbarian, and the DM's other friend wanted to be a Druid. The way I saw it was that I couldn't play a Paladin because of the two clerics and I never really liked playing magic or other ranged classes which left me with either Rogue or Monk. until the DM brought up the Blood Hunter home brew. He basically said that I could be the sort of the ""Van Hellsing"" of the group and I liked that. I was all on board however he wanted my character to have a focus on range, he knew I didn't really like being ranged and I told him that we could compromise but  that was where the conversation ended for a few days. In that time I was working on what my character looked like, his background, as well as voice. then, two days before the session was to start he walked up to me and said ""Your character isn't going to work."" I asked him what was wrong with it and that I could change parts that didn't work for his campaign, but he didn't answer. 

Then in gym class, some of the people who were coming to the session had the same class, which made it easy and fun to discuss ideas and character concepts, I overheard them talking about how the Druid was going to be a Firbolg, a playable race not found in the Player Handbook, i didn't think anything of it at the time but not even fifteen minutes went by when I heard them say ""now if only ***my name here*** played an magic class or ranger"" then everything clicked into place. He had been trying to get me to make a ranged type character, classes that I were never really fond of. So I told him that I'm not going to be coming and he asked me why. Itold him that i was worried that the session wasn't going to go well and listed off things that I was worried of: the DM was bad at improvising on the spot and if someone didn't show up to a session then he had a hard time thinking up a reason why their character was either not with the party, or doing anything; and the fact that the last time we had a large group of people ended with us ending the campaign prematurely, and the fact that the DM had the tendency to have us play D&amp;D into the dead of night from 11 am to 10 pm. during that class period I told the other two and gave them the same reasons that I told the DM and I thought that was it. as class was ending I was behind them and I heard the DM say ""don't worry if you can't make it to a session, I'll think of something to explain why you aren't doing anything."" I didn't talk to them about the session on friday and just wanted to know how well the session went on Saturday.

The Monday after the session finally came and i asked each player how it went. I asked the DM and he said it went great. I asked his girlfriend and her friend and they said it went well, I asked the player playing the Bard and he said that he was only there for an hour before he left. This caught me a bit off guard but then I asked the guy who played the Druid and he said ""It was a fucking shitshow."" I asked what happened and he said that The DM's girlfriend's friend's boyfriend didn't show up, the Bard left after making his character, the DM's girlfriend started to cry because she didn't like her character (she got emotional on a few past sessions as well but not to the point of crying), but what really caused the most damage was the Druid. The way he described how he played was that his character was a wall and refused to move out of the way of things like trees and buildings so when he came across a house he decided to punch it, and in one punch destroyed the house. The DM looked right at him upset and said ""That was a plot important house, you ruined the game, game over."" followed by him closing all his books and his girlfriend starting to cry once more. two things ran through my mind after hearing that. One, why did the session that went wrong the most have to be the one with the campaign that I was the most excited to play, but the second thing was that i was 100% right about it not going well.

I know that I was no saint in this story either but even still I have always tried to compromise with the DM on things like my characters. I spend a long time making characters that I want to play, whether because of their backstory, or because of their potential interactions with other players and npcs.

Here's the specifics:

4 players who were all level 4, point buy, max hp on level up:

- A ranger focused on dueling as his fighting style
- A paladin with a +1 rapier and plate armor, potion of fire breath
- A rogue with a +1 hand crossbow, dust of disappearance/coughing
- A wizard (necromancy) with Cape of Montebank, Wand of Webs, and of course their wizard spells

VS

- A werebear
- 2 wererats who come into the fight 1d6 rounds in.

Now by itself according to Kobold Fight Club, a werebear is a hard encounter. With 2 wererats thrown in it is deadly. This fight is coming off of a full long rest and everyone had all spell slots, all their items, and full health. Although KFC told me it was deadly, I balanced around the idea that everyone would be at full health, the encounter was 100% melee only enemies, and that they would potentially be able to completely stomp the enemies with only a couple crowd control abilities and focused fire.

The way it worked was a trap; the werebear human led them to his cave where he tricked them into thinking a regular bear was killing his friends before he closed and locked the door behind them and then transformed. This part went great and the players were positioned advantageously in terms of front-line vs back-line characters.

From there things just didn't work out. The bear knocked the ranger in a couple rounds, he stabilized and was knocked again, the bear then knocked the paladin after missing a few times and then getting really good rolls (no crits), and when the weak were rats came in they knocked the wizard and almost knocked the rogue. It ended with the rogue disengaging with their bonus action, finishing the very very low werebear off, and then in turn shooting the wererats dead. From there, nobody had any healing potions on their person or medicine kits, the last standing rogue rolled a 7 on their medicine check for getting the paladin back up, and they had to roll death saving throws to stabilize without any other means of reviving.

**For all three players, they rolled a 1.** And then failed one more save from there.

Now here's where I will complain/justify myself: At no point in this fight did the paladin perform any healing in the form of lay on hands either for himself or his downed ranger, the bear was never webbed or hit with any disabling spell, the cape was never used, the rogue switched to unarmed attacks to fight the wererats for a round instead of their rapier, the paladin also switched to unarmed attacks for a round against the werebear, and as I already mentioned nobody had any healing potions or healing spells that were used.

How can I do better as a DM? There were some supremely unlucky rolls here for death saving throws, but how can I balance an encounter around players like this? Not saying that in a bad way; I think it's a lot of fun to switch to melee and fight the bear or rat like a man. But now you're dead, like really dead new character for next time dead. What can I do in situations like this? Was I too harsh or did I put a stupidly difficult fight in?

Really looking for some feedback and opinions from better DMs than me, as I want the adventure to have danger but this is my first time killing anybody.

1. As you gain beams can you split them to hit different targets or not? This is mainly for fighting multiple enemies or hitting an enemy to kill it then hitting another afterwards with a second beam
2. For Agonizing Blast does the +Cha. modifier apply to each beam individually?
3. For Repelling Blast, do you get to choose if the enemy is repelled and how far, or is it simply a straight up 10 feet every time?
4. How important is LoS for Eldritch Blast? I understand needing to see an enemy, but what if they're in like the trees of a forest? Does it just magically track or do you have to roll with disadvantage?

&amp;#x200B;

I think part of the issue is these feats contain many different abilities. Just look at Shield Master; you get your shield's AC to dex saving throws, evasion, *and* the ability to shove opponents with a bonus action. I'm not saying SM is too powerful, but it's just allot at once. Same with GWM, SS, PAM, and others. Currently these feats have to give you so much because ASI's come so infrequently and you have to sacrifice ability scores to get them.

Instead I think it would make more sense to break these feats up into there separate components and let marshal classes choose them every two to three levels starting with their choice of fighting style, sort of like how spell levels work now. Fighters would get more than other classes like they can get more feats currently. Maybe also gate the more powerful effects, like +10 damage, behind prerequisites or level requirements so that characters can only get them at higher levels. Heck you could even do ""lesser"" and ""greater"" versions of GWM like in the olden days. This would even out the power curve for marshal characters a little more and I think would give players a better sense of progression. You could even add some of the UA stuff like tunnel fighter, where its probably a little too powerful for a fighting style but maybe under powered for a feat, into this system. 

Just something I thought would make Marshal PCs a bit more interesting in a hypothetical later addition or ambitious homebrew. Let me know what you guys think.

Currently, what I have is pretty much a Paladin, but with LoH being inverted to do harm, which (oddly enough) they called Harm Touch. 

Some of my quandary is with how healing is “budgeted” vs. damage. LoH’s pool gains “points” at a rate of Paladin level * 5, but this rate is budgeted with healing and curing conditions in mind. Would it be fair to assume the rate of point accumulation could be higher, and remain relatively balanced, value-wise, if it were strictly a damaging ability?

My current thinking is to make it a damage dump on a 1/long rest basis. The idea being that the pool gets emptied in a reckless, devastating torrent of negative energy. (In the face, ideally.)

Modeling it on the cleric spell, Inflict Wounds, seems appropriate. I like that there is no save, so you won’t “blow the daily”, but base the damage portion on dice rolls, adding some variability. 

Would the ability ultimately scaling to, say, 10d10, once per long rest, be crazy? I don’t want to compare it to spells cast at 9th level, but maybe the level 14 Fiend Warlock ability Hurl Through Hell is a fair comparable? 

If so, what’s a fair starting point? 1d10 at 1st level, 1/LR?  

What about basing the scaling on d6? Everyone loves dishing out a handful of d6’s, but I like that it would make the results a bit more consistent on average, as well as making the pool progression a bit smoother. 

Also, I should probably say that keeping Divine Smite is negotiable. My plan was to maybe replace it with another aura or something as a concession to balancing against Harm Touch. 

TL;DR: How much damage is likely to be fair for a long rest feature designed to replace Lay on Hands?

I did my very best to preserve most of this adventure in original form; 95% of it is probably exactly the same. Only a couple of monsters are switched out, the original characters are cleaned up, and the traps explained a little bit better.

So, what is the The Halls of Beol-Dur? It's a fairly standard dungeon, although it does have a couple of interesting traps. There are a load of Salamanders and other nasty surprises to deal with, so watch out!

If you see something that you think doesn't work and want to make suggestions for improvements, comment below! I'm not a very good DM so I probably missed stuff.

The original adventure can be found by Googling ""Dragon Magazine 37.""

Imps are intelligent creatures and they have hands with opposable thumbs. RAW, it appears this should be allowed.

I'll go first. This isn't in any way optimal, but a friend of mine invented a character that is a chicken wizard. Not awakened or anything, just an average chicken plus wizard levels, with around 1-2 intelligence. Why this chicken's clucking and pecking have become spells is unknown. This character, at first level, is incapable of normal speech, can only prepare one spell, and is virtually incapable of casting that spell offensively. This is why, much like in an orc wizard build, it will only ever prepare buff spells and battlefield control- the rest of its spells known will be rituals.

I&amp;#39;d like to hear your stories about your beast characters whether they be awakened, animal companions, or even familiars. How did you bring a unique and flavorful playstyle to the game?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go first. This isn&amp;#39;t in any way optimal, but a friend of mine invented a character that is a chicken wizard. Not awakened or anything, just an average chicken plus wizard levels, with around 1-2 intelligence. Why this chicken&amp;#39;s clucking and pecking have become spells is unknown. This character, at first level, is incapable of normal speech, can only prepare one spell, and is virtually incapable of casting that spell offensively. This is why, much like in an orc wizard build, it will only ever prepare buff spells and battlefield control- the rest of its spells known will be rituals.

Blade of Blood Letting

This is an ornate blade used mostly for blood rituals or thing of the sort, by feeding the blade your own blood you enact the magical properties of the blade.  
The dagger has 2 charges.  You can use one of the following abilities granted by the blade by expanding one charge.  The blade regains 1 charge at each dawn.

Misty step: you can teleport to up to 30 feet in any direction, must be visible to you. (You lose 1d6 hit points)

Unholy smite: you charge this blade with blood magic energy.  The next attack with this dagger that hits will deal an extra 2d4 necrotic damage. (You lose 1d6 hitpoints)

Necrotic shroud: you can choose yourself, or one creature you can see. That creature has advantage on stealth checks for the next minute (You lose 1d4 hitpoints)
