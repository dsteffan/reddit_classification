My plan is to charge at one enemy and then charge at the next, pinballing around the fight rather than focusing on one.  There are 2 pieces Magic Items I want to eventually use for this build: Rhino Hide (later Mammoth Hide) and Belt of Thunderous Charging (Arabalest Clock, Shoes of Lightning Leaping, and Crusader’s Tabard are on the wishlist, if gold allows).  Of course, I’ll have to Shock my weapon.

I’m going to ramble through my thought process and then have the current build at the end.

Race:  I’m a martial class, so I’ll need good physical stats.  Dwarf is solid and has Slow and Steady to counteract wearing armor.  Has some alternate traits that should work fine.

Worst part about charging are the allies standing in your way, so we need a way to bypass them.  We could ask them not to block your lane, but it’s Society and that can’t be planned on.  Will need a feat or ability.  

Feat: Charging Stag Style lets us do that AND ignore difficult terrain AND lets us make one turn along the way if we need to.  Prereqs aren’t trivial, but are doable (13 DEX, Dodge, Mobility, Improved Unarmed), and I'll want Mobility anyway.

Dragon Style also lets us charge through allies and ignore difficult terrain.  Some bonus to a few saves.  Will never use the 1.5x STR bonus though.  Prereqs are a little easier (15 STR, Improved Unarmed, Acro 3).  Though would take to Level 3 to get.

Abilities: Some Barbarian rage powers seem close to ""on brand"".  Erratic Charge (make a turn, kinda?), Sprint (but need to be 4th level...would be good if i'm primarily barbarian), 

I need access to a reach weapon.  Longspear would work, would need Simple Weapons.  Or, if I’m sticking as Dwarf, Dwarven Longhammer or Longaxe.  Doesn’t quite match Ornsteins DragonSpear, but I’m not that picky.

I want this build to “come online” as soon as it can, don’t want to spend 5 levels kind of doing what I want…and I’ve become obsessed with Charging Stag.  So, the current plan/build is:

Dwarf Traits: Slow and Steady (not slowed by armor/encumbrance), Unstoppable (for Toughness and +1 FORT), Relentless (+2 CMD on bullrush/overrun).

Other Traits: Defender of Society - +1 AC in medium armor.  Adopted (Ifrit) – Hot Headed: +1 DMG on charge

Stats (after racial bonuses applied):
STR: 16
DEX: 14
CON: 16
INT: 10
WIS: 14
CHA: 6

Level 1: Unchained Monk.  Gets me Improved Unarmed (free), Dodge (bonus monk feat), for Charging Stag.  I can’t make use of Flurry of Blows with armor (but might be handy once?) and don’t plan on staying Monk long enough to worry about not getting the AC bonus or Fast Movement.

Level 1 Feat: Mobility.

Level 2: Fighter – Mobile Archetype.  Fighter Feat: Charging Stag Style (is a Combat Feat).  This also gains me Proficiency in medium armor which I’ll need.

Level 3: Fighter – Mobile Archetype.  Fighter Feat: Power Attack.  I also get Agility: +1 vs paralyses, slow, or entangle effects.

Level 3 Feat: Combat Reflexes (I have a reach weapon, seems good)

Hit: +6 / +8 if Charge / +7 Charge, PA

DMG: 11 / 12 if Charge / 14 Charge, PA

And this is where I’m stuck.  I think it’s fairly fine now, but where do I go from here?  I’m not doing insane damage, but that’s fine with me…I’m not useless in combat.  Should I stick with Fighter for Leaping Attack?  Do I continue to multiclass to pick up other abilities?

Multiclass options I’ve found:

Bloodrager (Undead bloodline).  Access to bloodrage to help my damage, the hit to AC doesn’t matter TOO much as I’m using a reach weapon.  Maybe take the Urban Bloodrager Archetype to pump everything to STR for damage and assume the HP and AC kind of cancel each other out. I do get Fast Movement and Frightful Charger which seems pretty good (shaken on every target of my charge? It’ll either be amazing or useless).  

Cleric (Travel Domain).  Low BAB hurts, but pump to Will Save isn’t nothing.  Also get +10 movement to base speed and Agile Feet which lets me ignore difficult terrain.  If I take the Varsian Pilgrim archetype, I should also be able to give Agile Feet to party members, which could be handy.

Inquisitor (Persistence Inquisition).  Low Bab again, but +2 Will.  I get Step Up for free which is great against casters and Relentless Footing for +10 movement 5 times a day as a swift action.  Can also cast Linebreaker.

Barbarian for Swift Foot and Sprint rage powers.  Will need 4 levels, so not really a 'dip'.  Doesn't really play nice with bloodrage and Frightful Charge AND Swift foot is an enhancement bonus, which doesn't stack with Inquisitor's Relentless Footing... probably not worth it.

I don’t know if I dip one of these classes (or all of these).  Is there something simple I’m missing?  A Class or archetype that is PERFECT for what I’m trying to do?  I looked at cavalier, which seems great at charging…so long as you’re on a mount and I don’t want that.  I think the Cleric or Inquisitor dips might be a little too cute to really work (and I might have deity issues to boot), but I couldn’t find anything else that really stood out that’s a huge help to my plan.  

I don’t think I need to bend over backwards to pick up classes/items to increase movement too terribly much…PFS fights aren’t typically in an open field and those that are, I probably shouldn’t end up half a mile from party members.  Some feats like Spring Attack and Vital Strike don’t work with Charge, so those are out.

Any ideas?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a new character, and I my inspiration is Ornstein from Dark Souls.  My plan is to charge at one enemy and then charge at the next, pinballing around the fight rather than focusing on one.  There are 2 pieces Magic Items I want to eventually use for this build: Rhino Hide (later Mammoth Hide) and Belt of Thunderous Charging (Arabalest Clock, Shoes of Lightning Leaping, and Crusader’s Tabard are on the wishlist, if gold allows).  Of course, I’ll have to Shock my weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to ramble through my thought process and then have the current build at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race:  I’m a martial class, so I’ll need good physical stats.  Dwarf is solid and has Slow and Steady to counteract wearing armor.  Has some alternate traits that should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst part about charging are the allies standing in your way, so we need a way to bypass them.  We could ask them not to block your lane, but it’s Society and that can’t be planned on.  Will need a feat or ability.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feat: Charging Stag Style lets us do that AND ignore difficult terrain AND lets us make one turn along the way if we need to.  Prereqs aren’t trivial, but are doable (13 DEX, Dodge, Mobility, Improved Unarmed), and I&amp;#39;ll want Mobility anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon Style also lets us charge through allies and ignore difficult terrain.  Some bonus to a few saves.  Will never use the 1.5x STR bonus though.  Prereqs are a little easier (15 STR, Improved Unarmed, Acro 3).  Though would take to Level 3 to get.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm Derry, the DM of the Dice Will Roll podcast, here with a new episode of our show! We're a group of 4 friends who love Pathfinder, and have been playing it for a good chunk of our friendship! We liked the playtest for the new Pathfinder 2nd Edition so much that we decided we couldn't wait for August for the finished product. Til then, we've decided to try out playing the legendary Kingmaker Adventure Path with the new rules.  This is the result! Our first handful of episodes have a little rough audio, but we pick up swiftly after that, so stick with us! Additionally, our show features music from the Kingmaker CRPG by Owlcat Games, including some by Dragon Age's Inon Zur, used with permission from the game's devs! Though we're using the Playtest rules, we're updating constantly to follow what we know to be in the final version of PF2 to give the most accurate Second Edition Experience currently possible! Without further ado, we hope you enjoy! If you do, make sure to tell a friend, leave an iTunes Review, subscribe to our feed or support us on Patreon! And just to get you hooked, here's a teaser for our latest episode: Fables &amp; Fey! 

*Our explorers of the Stolen Lands are on the hunt: they're looking for the monstrous Tatzylwyrm, a snake-like dragon which is rumoured to lurk along the rivers of the Greenbelt! However, as per usual, stuff gets in the way- some tricksters toy with them, they tell each other their pasts, and become closer as friends! But can the power of friendship prepare them for the ghastly discovery that waits in the clearing..? Who's to say? Maybe it will, maybe it won't! It all depends on how the dice roll!*

*Stories get woven. Monsters get hunted. Dread creeps through souls. All this and more in this episode of  Dice Will Roll, where we ask the hard questions like... how do I get these annoying invisible pranksters to leave me alone?*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working in my free time on an application that I would like to make available to the community. The goal is to write a program (ideally something that could be ran on a raspberry pi with an LCD or maybe a phone app - completely free and open source) that could connect players and GM together during a session. You could build your character on the app, as well as keep track of everything. A digital datasheet of the sorts. In addition to that I would like to implement a way to connect this app with other players and the GM to form groups. During the session players could add buffs (which would get approved by the gm) and the changes would reflect in the stats of the character. Debuffs would follow similarly. I would like it if the GM could see all information for every player, but the players are limited to only their own info.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started writing up this application in python as its OOP is very easy to work with. I have found tables from d20pfsrd that link to pathfindercommunity. So I have the information needed for 90% of it. I could webscrape d20pfsrd for the rest of it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am stuck with now is creating the logic for all the individual objects, and connecting it. For example pathfindercommunity has these giant databases for spells and feats, which is perfect. On the abstract level I am stuck however.

&amp;#x200B;

From the creators point of view, when creating pathfinder did they use templates for feats,spells, etc. I'm thinking they must, for example there are equations for class BABs. The formula is

&amp;#x200B;

BAB = character\_level \* BAB\_Category

&amp;#x200B;

where BAB\_Category can take on 1 of three discrete values 1,3/4,1/2

Is there some sort of similar abstraction for classes, feats, spells, etc.? If so, are these abstract views documented somewhere?

To give a more concrete example, lets look at skills.

&amp;#x200B;

A skill has the following abstraction from my understanding:

&amp;#x200B;

* Untrained (A Binary) - indicating whether the skill can used without training.
* Skill Bonus (Integer) - the sum of (Ability Modifier, Ranks, Racials, Feats, Misc, Ac Penalty), and is the added bonus applied when performing a that skill check.
* Ability Modifier (Integer) -  The bonus gained from the corresponding ability modifier. For example Appraise checks are intellect based and therefore you add your intellect ability modifier.
* Class Skill (A Binary) - increases skill bonus by 3 if the player has put training into the skill.
* Racial (Integer) - A skill bonus (or penalty) gained for being a specific race.
* Feat (Integer) - A skill bonus (or penalty) gained for having a selected feat.
* Misc (Integer) - A sum of various temporary buffs, debuffs, and gear bonuses. (This field could be abstracted into various parts).
* Armory Check Penalty (Integer) - A skill penalty due to the armor being worn by the character.

So to my understanding the above is the abstracted template for skills in pathfinder. Are there similar templates, already worked (I would like to make sure I have it correct the first time) for spells, feats, etc?

&lt;li&gt;Ability Modifier (Integer) -  The bonus gained from the corresponding ability modifier. For example Appraise checks are intellect based and therefore you add your intellect ability modifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Skill (A Binary) - increases skill bonus by 3 if the player has put training into the skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racial (Integer) - A skill bonus (or penalty) gained for being a specific race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feat (Integer) - A skill bonus (or penalty) gained for having a selected feat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misc (Integer) - A sum of various temporary buffs, debuffs, and gear bonuses. (This field could be abstracted into various parts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armory Check Penalty (Integer) - A skill penalty due to the armor being worn by the character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to my understanding the above is the abstracted template for skills in pathfinder. Are there similar templates, already worked (I would like to make sure I have it correct the first time) for spells, feats, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

First-time caster here, and I decided to go with an Arcanist because Wizard or Sorcerer were just too plain for me, I guess (I know there are plenty of ways for them not to be plain -- just some post hoc rationalizing on my part). Anywho, I'm looking for some feedback on my existing skill tree, and any suggestions for how to achieve the kind of playstyle I'm going for. A little background:

&amp;#x200B;

We're running the Curse of the Crimson Throne campaign. My character's name is Kozmo, and he's a human Arcanist living in Korvosa. History of significant mental health problems, lost both his parents as a kid (Took the Orphaned campaign trait, ofc), bouts of homelessness, and a tenuous relationship with reality (I'm a trained mental health professional IRL with inpatient psychiatric experience, so I'm doing my best to inhabit his character from an informed and humanistic perspective). Essentially, he started manifesting psychotic features during early adulthood as part of his sorcerer bloodline heritage, but was homeless and had no idea how to interpret his experiences. He's also gained a talent for stealing, but typically only to survive. Over time (and through some other exposition), he's learned to control his powers somewhat through training and study of his condition (hence the wizard part, so now he's an Arcanist). Along the way, friends were hard come by and even harder to trust, so his only true companion is a pet squirrel named Chippers (as of yet unknown origin; to be explained through gameplay, ofc) who he talks to incessantly -- it's pretty one-way. This relationship will evolve as Kozmo gains more control over his abilities (AKA, the squirrel is non-negotiable -- he's already the most popular character on the team...)

&amp;#x200B;

Gameplay-wise, I'm hoping to be high-utility for my team with decent summoning ability, but also the ability to blow shit up on occasion when the need arises or my eccentricities get the best of me (i.e. push Fireball hard). Unstable, but also highly intelligent and always has the right tool for the occasion. Please help me live out my Pathfinder aspirations!

**tl;dr -- Plz help me channel the spirit of Kramer into Magic Batman.**

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I want it to be broken up into parts, to be super vague, or obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone willing to help would be appreciated. I even welcome bad ideas, lol.&lt;/p&gt;

So, I've recently come up with an interesting spell idea, but am having a hard time thinking of how to execute it.  The idea is for a spell (maybe cantrip) for luck-based clerics and such that consumes coins for a chance of damage.  The only material component would be coins.  The die type for the damage would depend on the coin type (copper being a d2, platinum being something else).  The number of die would be how many coins you put into it, but for each die there would be a -1 to damage so there could always be a chance for 0 damage.  The big problem I've been having is balancing.  I'm thinking of restricting numbers of coins and type to certain levels, but I'm still not sure about the numbers.  Please help.

So, I've (finally) decided to consider the Fighter dip to get some extra feats. That's all fine, a lot of players do this. Its made better when taking an archetype that removes some armor and shield which I would get back with the dip. I was looking at some Fighter Archetypes when I came upon the Free-Style Fighter, an Archetype that provides the fighter with the Martial Flexibility feature of the Brawler. That got me thinking, why not just take a level of Brawler. 

I would be dipping max 2lvls over the course of this Swashbuckler's life, and taking Fighter would get me \~heavy armor and shields, 2 feats, and Bravery. Not too bad, total net gain all around. 

However, 2lvls in Brawler would give me \~shields + exotic close weapons, Brawlers Cunning, Martial Flexibility, Martial Training, Unarmed Strike 1d6, 1 Bonus Feat, and Brawler's Flurry. I can admit Cunning kinda overlaps Swashbuckler Finesse, and Martial Training isn't much, but the rest of the stuff I would get seems to outshine the Fighter in every way. One could make an argument that since Swash and Brawler levels both count as fighter, you can count Swash levels into the number of Martial Flexibility uses a day (though I know that's pushing it).

Please tell me if I've lost my mind. Tell me if this is actually as tilted to favor the Brawler as I think it is. If the information presented is correct, I don't see why any one would take a fighter dip unless it was for armor and weapon profs.

1. The first is a question about terminology and leveling up. In multiple places the book will talk about numbers of hit dice. E.g. in the introduction it says ""Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as “3d8.” This value is used to determine a creature’s total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice"" (12). Yet, anywhere I see hit die listed I only see the die type (e.g. a fighter's d10). So when they say somebody has 3 hit die, for example, does that simply mean that they are a level 3 player who has rolled the hit die at each level, or do they actually roll 3 die? If the latter, do you gain more die as you level up such that a level 3 fighter would be rolling 3d10? I doubt it, that would balloon health super fast, but I'm just confused by the description. 
2. The constitution bonus - Is there anywhere besides the description of the effects of he constitution attribute where it tells me to add the constitution bonus to the hit die? I'm sure I'm just missing it, but I want to know for future reference. Also, it's unclear to me if the first level hit points you get include the con bonus. Everyone online seems to say it does, but in the description of constitution it says that you apply your constitution bonus to ""Each *roll* of a Hit Die"" (16, emphasis mine). You don't roll at level one, you simply take the highest possibility of your hit die. So does level one count as a roll even though you don't *actually* roll?

The witch's evil eye is among the same vein, though you're a caster yourself at that point.  Could also shaken or sicken our enemies.

Any better ideas?  


EDIT: the best answer I've been able to think of so far is to take a level in [Arcanist](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/), and select the [Dimensional Slide](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/dimensional-slide-su/) ability. It allows you to teleport a short distance as part of a move action, and as far as I can tell it should be compatible with the move action allowed by Levitate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m playing a Drow Rogue with the Drow Nobility feat tree.

&lt;li&gt;Get a flying familiar to haul me along. One of the better options I can come up with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any better ideas?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: the best answer I&amp;#39;ve been able to think of so far is to take a level in &lt;a href=""http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/""&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;, and select the &lt;a href=""http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/dimensional-slide-su/""&gt;Dimensional Slide&lt;/a&gt; ability. It allows you to teleport a short distance as part of a move action, and as far as I can tell it should be compatible with the move action allowed by Levitate.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll put the text below for any to read but here's what I understand.
You start game with four cantrips (level 0 spells) and two 1st level spells and you gain new ones depending on what the Skalds spell chart says. At level 5 along with the Skalds spell chart I may switch out an existing spell I already know for one of equal or higher level and every 3 levels after that? So I assume this is to simply allow players the chance to switch out spells they don't like or use? And you can switch them for higher level spells? I'm very new and the wording for these can be a bit confusing so thanks ahead of time for any help I reciece! 

The skald’s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald’s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Skald Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn’t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Skald Spells Known are fixed.

At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

I'm running a campaign where I injected the adventure ""Hollow's Last Hope"". A [Soulspeaker](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/r-z/soulspeaker/)  is a magical device that shows up in it and the gist of it that it's an  amulet that can record and play back any message, if the conditions set  for playing it back are met.

There is  seemingly no maximum capacity for storing messages and the conditions  don't have any constraints, so I don't think they necessarily need to be  keywords.

i can't shake off the feeling  that this has enormous mindgames potential in my campaign, but I  bafflingly can't come up with much. It's basically like having a very  primitive computer.

Can you guys help me brainstorm?

Til then, we've decided to try out playing Kingmaker with the new rules.  This is the result! We're new to this kinda thing, so any support we can get would be hugely appreciated- give us a listen and give us some advice, some ideas, some feedback, and help spread the word if you can! We came here last week, and we got a tonne of support- thank you for giving us a shot! Here's a teaser of our latest episode, Castles &amp; Comrades!

*After a busy day adventuring, our heroes of the wilds get ready to continue their quest, but come upon a few minor roadblocks which cause them to reconsider their plan of action. And by a few, I mean a single one. And by minor, I mean super major. And by reconsider their plan of action, I mean realize this whole bandit-slaying thing just got a million times more deadly. For our heroes, I mean.*

 *Dreams get discussed. Warnings get given. Companions get introduced. All this and more in this episode of Dice Will Roll, the Gayest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet, where we ask the hard questions like... is it a problem if I find the grizzled silver fox with an axe to my throat kinda sexy?*

We&amp;#39;re new to this kinda thing, so any support we can get would be hugely appreciated- give us a listen and give us some advice, some ideas, some feedback, and help spread the word if you can! We came here last week, and we got a tonne of support- thank you for giving us a shot! Here&amp;#39;s a teaser of our latest episode, Castles &amp;amp; Comrades!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After a busy day adventuring, our heroes of the wilds get ready to continue their quest, but come upon a few minor roadblocks which cause them to reconsider their plan of action. And by a few, I mean a single one. And by minor, I mean super major. And by reconsider their plan of action, I mean realize this whole bandit-slaying thing just got a million times more deadly. For our heroes, I mean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dreams get discussed. Warnings get given. Companions get introduced. All this and more in this episode of Dice Will Roll, the Gayest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet, where we ask the hard questions like... is it a problem if I find the grizzled silver fox with an axe to my throat kinda sexy?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnote: Yes, the creators of this podcast are gay, and we talk about that a lot in the podcast itself. Whenever we post this kinda stuff, we get some real smart guys pretending not to be homophobic, just ~disproving~ of content that isn&amp;#39;t inherently straight. I&amp;#39;m not gonna put up with it this time, so anyone trying stuff in that vein&amp;#39;s gonna get blasted by my powerful forearm laser til they get bored and go away! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

1). When using Scorched Earth(Ex), does the [Reliable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/reliable/) magical enchantment reduce misfire by increasing the threshold for number of dice that rolled a 1 on damage?

If so, does the explosion center on the target of Big Boom?

4). How does the dragon pistol's ranged increments come into play with bullets (10 ft.) and pellets (15 ft.) out to Big Boom's 30 ft. range?

1:  trying to keep the pace as quick as possible.  with 7 players it takes  a while for peoples turn to come back again. Do I just live with it or does anyone have any house rules or suggestions to speed things up.

2.  we are playing Curse of the Crimson throne module.   
What is the best way to increase difficulty due to the high party size.  I would usually increase the amount of baddies but with 7 PCs if I am playing 12 Im worried battles will just drag on.
I have increased the AC and HP of baddies before if they are just breezing through it but I have had difficulty applying that effectively and consistently.

Just for your info the party consists of

Fighter, fighter, bard, ranger, cleric , wizard, rouge.

They have an NPC cleric that sometimes follows them.

My goals are to get battles flowing faster.  hopefully as everyone gets more comfortable with the rules it will speed things up.  I still get questions about hit rolls and damage rolls. 

With 7 guys in the initiative the bad guys may never get to go... ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My party has quite quickly ballooned to a 7 party group.  this is all their first experience playing.I am not the most experienced DM( a bit over 1 year)&lt;/p&gt;

So I'd like to get one final ruling to run past my GM in our campaign.


&gt;The chart for eidolons show their max number of attacks based on level. Otherwise natural attacks don't work any differently for them than anything else. No penalties when using all their attacks. It requires a full attack action to get all of your attacks. They don't follow the normal iterative attack you'd get for a high BAB. If you were hasted you'd get one extra attack at full bonuses, but not all three attacks.


This comment seems to be echoed elsewhere, including on the Paizo forums in older threads.


But [the old Paizo guide](http://legacy.aonprd.com/advancedPlayersGuide/baseClasses/summoner.html#bab) says:


&gt;BAB: This is the eidolon's base attack bonus. An eidolon's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.


So, how should it work? Taking my eidolon for example:

I am level 5, my Eidolon is Bipedal, and has 2 natural attacks + a Power Attack feat:

Eidolon has +5 STR (16+2+2)


Claws (x2) | D20+9 | 1d4+5

Gore | D20+9 | 1d6+5


Feat: Power Attack 


In a situation where my Eidolon hits a [mannequin](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=1009&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=-MVtXLvSLZG8UvnXpuAH&amp;q=mannequin&amp;oq=manaquin&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0i67j0i10j0i67l3j0i10j0i67j0i10l3.1537.2817..3897...0.0..0.90.661.8......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......35i39j0.MTN7rDrvBiA#imgrc=oy3xKUDyaV16qM:) with *AC:10 *

So far so good in my opinion. Going off the path a little bit to help rpund out the team utility some more...but the one big thing I can't seem to figure out is...
How the hell do I make a weapon to deal more damage to (as far as I care just) Magical Beasts? 
Of course Ranger has the Favored Enemy class ability, and if I could, I'd take a Gain Favored Enemy feature feat if I could but I'm not seeing it anywhere..and i really don't want to delay my Magus build any more than I have to (not against it if that's the only probably solution)...

But does anyone know a way for me to make a ""silver sword"" likewise to Witcher for pathy? 
(All I want is practically a longsword that gets a +2 against magical beasts. If I could I'd take a downside to another creature type. Such as +4 to MagBeast, -2 to everything else. 
I want to say this is somewhere if the craft wonderous weapon area, but I haven't seen anything conclusive in the Core book.)

Noticed that in the Ultimate Combat guide that Arcane Bane was an Arcane Pool option at lv 15. It'll be a long wait if I don't find or make a bane blade by then, but that'll be fulfilling enough once I get it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:

I'm part of a group playing Kingmaker, with a mix of Pathfinder, HARP and Rolemaster (moving towards the latter because of Fantasygrounds module). But the system is (perhaps) beside the question: What (perhaps out-of-game) mechanics can I employ to make me be more true to my character? Both out-of-combat and in-combat.

&amp;#x200B;

The background for my character:

&amp;#x200B;

**Age 0-5:** Not many memories, other than that of a woman's face, perhaps my mother

**Age 6-10:** I remember both a father figure and a mother figure, however, sometime during this

period they both dissappear from my life and at the same time I'm sent to boys home in the slums of

New Stetven. My parents leave me only a map en-carved in a leather scrap. A map of a place I have

yet to discover.

**Age 11-15**: I continue to look for the placed that is mapped on the leather scrap, making my way

from day to day in the boys home. I quickly discover that I have nimble hands and quick feet and

make due by helping both the boys home nurses and wardens by carrying their belongings on a yet-

to-be-disclosed amount of time.

**Age 16-20:** I pay frequent visits to the jail in New Stetven, at first to serve time and later on with a

completely different purpose. The prison warden is as corrupt as any official in this city and soon

employ my services in return for serving no time, his hands doesn't sit idle when I return empty-

handed. That however does not happen often, and from time to time it happens on purpose, when I

discover the true value of the goods I procure.

**Age 21-22:** Through efficient use of my network, my services are frequently used on a very low-

key basis. I have more than enough for myself, and often share with my contacts from the boys

home where I don't live anymore. I live on the streets now, moving from place to place through a set

of places no-one but I know about, places like beneath bridge spans etc. Its tough not being able to

move out of poverty without questions being asked, so I don't keep more than I need. My network is

now centered around a group of gypsies that perform and act in the many taverns and marked places

around the town. Through this group, I learn juggling. Juggling seems to soothe my mind and

distracts me from the poverty stricken reality in which I live.

My search for information on my leather scrap continues. Memory of the scrap eludes me. It does,

however, seem important to me somehow. From time to time, I spend a few coins being trained by

shady characters in the art of sword fighting. I've managed to procure a short sword that is proving

very valuable when it comes to opening chests and lockers.

**Age 23:** I make contact with a group called the ”Reapers”. They describe themselves as a thieving

guild, Reapers of Secrets. They seem interested in me. Having no prior knowledge of them, I don't

yet know if I have anything to gain by joining forces with them. I'll have to know more before I join

in any venture with them.

Besides the gypsies and their acting, I've found another use for my nimble hands. Woodworking, a

big trade in this city, seems to come easy to me. I've started crafting my own bow alongside selling

a few of them to local vendors. The profit from this craft comes nowhere near my more shady

business, so it stays a hobby.

One of my ventures go awry; On a visit to the largest tavern in the city's southern district, i spot a

traveler, ranger or fighter by the looks of it, playing a symphony of coins. Not the grandest, mind

you, but enough to get my attention. I was apparently not up to the game, she caught my hand in her

backpack. I tried the usual excuses, but I was not able to dupe her as I am most of my other, more

aware clientele. She didn't say a word and after while I thought perhaps she was not well. I couldn't

decipher the look she gave me, but when she finally spoke it was not what I was expecting. ”In

return for not turning you in..I need you to do something for me”. The rest of the evening was not

much different from any other job that comes my way. My employer did however, emphasize that

the victim somehow deserved what was coming. I didn't ask questions. In my experience, no good

ever comes from knowing more about the job than sufficient information about the item to procure,

and where to get it, or whom to get it from.

The fighter seemed to appreciate both my work and my attitude about getting it done.

After that evening, several months went by before she was in town again. Same tavern, same stool.

She was expecting to find me again, and by the gods or not, she did. Another job, higher stakes, not

much more of an effort on my part, but this time, I got a share of the loot.

Our connection stayed wholly professional. Since our first encounter, we've partnered up seven

times. Not all as jobs on my end. Working as a professional thief, you're bound to end up with more

than a few enemies. The better you are at your job in this business, the fewer knows you exist, but

working the same place more than once is not good business. The fighter helped me take care of

several gangs that had my name (or rather, one of my names) at the top of their list. Perhaps I

should consider new hunting grounds.

**Age 24:** I've heard of a charter to venture to new lands, making use of my network I manage to find

a group for this charter. As it so happens, the fighter with whom I've done business is in the same

group. Spending more time with her should prove interesting.

Going on this venture could be good for me. I would no longer have the houses of Brevoy right on

my doorstep, which should be a relief.

I'm looking for mechanics to help me play the character I designed, because I actually quite like the design. However, it feels like it ends up as another warrior when we fight and not very 'rogue'-like when we're not. I'm discussing with GM if the design can be turned such as to do less physical damage, and more poison damage for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards and thanks for any input","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m part of a group playing Kingmaker, with a mix of Pathfinder, HARP and Rolemaster (moving towards the latter because of Fantasygrounds module). But the system is (perhaps) beside the question: What (perhaps out-of-game) mechanics can I employ to make me be more true to my character? Both out-of-combat and in-combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background for my character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age 0-5:&lt;/strong&gt; Not many memories, other than that of a woman&amp;#39;s face, perhaps my mother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age 6-10:&lt;/strong&gt; I remember both a father figure and a mother figure, however, sometime during this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;period they both dissappear from my life and at the same time I&amp;#39;m sent to boys home in the slums of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Stetven. My parents leave me only a map en-carved in a leather scrap. A map of a place I have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yet to discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age 11-15&lt;/strong&gt;: I continue to look for the placed that is mapped on the leather scrap, making my way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from day to day in the boys home. I quickly discover that I have nimble hands and quick feet and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;make due by helping both the boys home nurses and wardens by carrying their belongings on a yet-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to-be-disclosed amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age 16-20:&lt;/strong&gt; I pay frequent visits to the jail in New Stetven, at first to serve time and later on with a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;completely different purpose. The prison warden is as corrupt as any official in this city and soon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;employ my services in return for serving no time, his hands doesn&amp;#39;t sit idle when I return empty-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;handed. That however does not happen often, and from time to time it happens on purpose, when I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;discover the true value of the goods I procure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age 21-22:&lt;/strong&gt; Through efficient use of my network, my services are frequently used on a very low-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;key basis. I have more than enough for myself, and often share with my contacts from the boys&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;home where I don&amp;#39;t live anymore. I live on the streets now, moving from place to place through a set&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of places no-one but I know about, places like beneath bridge spans etc. Its tough not being able to&lt;/p&gt;

I had a quick question. My GM approved a magical tattoo for our game (linked below). Basically as a free action I can increase my damage by 1d6 force damage twice a day.

1. Level 6 Lion Shaman Druid (15xp) (PP 21)

2. Level 7 Sylvan Sorcerer (20xp) (PP 16)

3. Level 4 Archer (multi-class) (10xp) (PP 14)

1. Level 1 with 3xp (PP 6) that hasn’t played a 4th game.

In addition, both the Druid and the Sorcerer played up several scenarios and have more gold than typical for their level.

I also have some unassigned GM credit from a home game I was involved in a few years back that I highly doubt was reported correctly.

I’m fairly certain that if I just rebuilt the characters as best I can remember them that no one would care. I’m also fairly sure that isn’t allowed.

1. Is the Kineticist overpowered? If not, why not?
2. How does the Kineticist Suffocate (ability?) work?
3. How does the Kineticist compare with Wizards? In a single combat, a series of combats over the course of the day, and in a face off.

The Backstory.

I was playing Pathfinder the other day, and one of the other players commented on how he doesn't allow Kineticists at his table because one of his friends would played one. Apparently, this third party was really good with the rules, and his Kineticist would suffocate boss monsters. Thus, my friend no longer allows Kineticists at his table.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this was a little harsh, but as a wizard, it's no skin off my nose. Still, it got me wondering. Could a Kineticist do what my friend claimed? Apparently yes, but I don't understand the ability or how to get out of it which is weird since most abilities have a way of the target avoid the worst aspects. As I was searching the Internet for answers, I read posts claiming the Kineticist was broken and op while other posts claimed they were mediocre especially compared to wizards. I did not see explanations for these claims, and so I ask you....

""This build is for killing people from up to about 1/4 mile away.

After level 5 you'll start taking slayer levels with the Sniper  archetype.  2 levels is all you need to realize how powerful this gets.   The Deadly Sniper class feature lets you completely ignore the normal  30ft range limit on sneak attack damage as long as your target is  unaware of your presence AND adds your Slayer class level to your damage  on top of that.  Get a [Far Reaching Sight](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/far-reaching-sight) to hit touch AC no matter how far away you are.  It gets better though.  Build into the [Sniper Shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/sniper-shot)  feat by taking feats you need anyway and now you can apply your sneak  attack damage to anything within your first range increment whether it's  aware of you or not.

He wants to tank, so he ended picking a Half-Orc Barbarian. Unexciting, but simple enough, right? 

Well, while we were showing him Half-Orc stuff on d20pfsrd, he saw the Poison Minion and his face lit up and he immediately started throwing out ideas about how he wanted to weaponize his blood. He even threw the idea of carrying a dagger around as his weapon and cutting himself open when entering a rage to primarily injure enemies with his blood. And of course, he's also open to some minor casting later on. 

Obviously, for flavor purposes, this is a really cool idea. I don't want to rain on his enthusiasm/creativity, but I'm really not sure how that kind of character would work. Also, I know Poison Minion typically only applies to bite attacks, but I figure in the real world if your blood is toxic, it doesn't matter how it gets into someone's system.

My first thought is to dip into another class to give him some freedom. An alchemist making bombs and mutagens out of his blood comes to mind. I've heard a (stripped down for simplicity) Black Blade Magus could work, and we could just flavor in that the blade is made of his blood. I've also seen Black Blood Oracle, which seems promising, but even then the blood can only be weaponized a limited number of times per day. Also, it would probably require more than a dip level-wise, and I'm worried about Oracle as a class for a brand-new player. Maybe I'm overthinking this and I should just tell him to coat his own weapon in his blood and take it from there.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a question for my fellow nerds. I am a ranger who primarily attacks with shield bashing. I found the hosteling enchantment extremely useful for getting my animal companion (medium sized) in and out of combat when needed. I also found this interesting tattoo (linked at bottom) which allows me to store a weapon in it (My shield is spiked so it technically is considered a weapon allowing it to be stored in the tattoo) so my question is thus: can I store my hosteling shield in my tattoo and if so can I give my animal companion a bag of holding to hold onto while stored in the shield? 

I know that if you put a bag of holding into a portable hole everything goes belly-up but I was wondering if this still applies to putting a bag of holding into my shield via my animal companion's saddlebags and my shield (and by extension my animal companion and the held bag of holding) into the tattoo.

Longtime Pathfinder player that's looking to start some PFS. I DM in a home game right now and looking to get some PC time, but also get used to the feel and culture of PFS before I try DMing there (for boons and paying it back). 

Just looking for some feedback on a a build I've wanted to try, as well as some advice on how to progress it after the first few games.

Maeric
NG Half-Elf Sylvan Sorcerer

8 STR 14 DEX 12 CON 12 INT 10 WIS 19 CHA

Alt Racial Traits: Arcane Training (and maybe Mordant Envoy) 

Traits: Beast Bond (for Handle Animal as class) and Magical Lineage (Magic Missile) 

Feat: Toughness

Skills: Bluff +8, Handle Animal +9, Perception +6, Spellcraft +5 (FCB lvl 1 to skill point) 

Cantrips: Read Magic, Prestidigitation, Acid Splash, Detect Magic
Spells: Enlarge Person, Color Spray

Items: Acid Flask (Alchemical Focus) 

Animal Companion is a Big Cat with Weapon Focus (claws) and a standard array of tricks (7 at level 1, I think) and acrobatics/perception for skills. 



Questions I had were:

Is Mordant Envoy worth it?

          - the array of SPL seems useful to a spells known limited sorcerer, and the +1cl to transmutation is nice too, but if I'm going to be limited on skill points is the free skill Focus better? 

Is Toppling Spell a good mix with PFS baddies?

          - I know it's much more useful against Humanoids with class levels, the idea of tripping a baddie in front of my cat is very appealing if I can pull it off. But if you run more into mostly monsters it becomes significantly less useful

Is 7 hp with no mage armor for one session bad? 

          - I know I can get a wand after my first session, but what are my odds of making it through to that point? And should is 7hp risky? Should I take toughness? I intend to retrain it to Boon Companion before I hit lvl 2, so I just need to get through the first 3 sessions. I also will take the human FCB to have more spells known starting at lvl 4.

Any thoughts are appreciated, and I'm really looking forward to get him going tableside!

I've never played PFS before, so I have no idea what information players have when joining a new game. I've played for a long time, but I've never been a GM. Our group recently split up after some graduated and I'm attempting to organize a new one. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We're not planning on playing it as an official event. We just wanted something simple to play that could get everyone comfortable with the game before we jump into an adventure path. We have two veteran players, one coming from 5e, and another who has never played D&amp;D. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The main thing is what information do I give them for making characters? I played an adventure path before and it gave suggestions for classes and hints about what to focus on, but I don't see anything about that for this.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I looked at the list of events on the PFS page and it seems like players simply get a campaign name and a very short description of what to expect. Is that all the information they have or are players given the longer preamble from the book beforehand?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm sure I'm overthinking all of this, but it seems too simple. Do people just make PFS characters then just jump into random games with no idea whether their character will be useful, marginalized, or even a liability?

First and foremost this is going to most likely be the party at the end of the game:

&amp;#x200B;

Level 17 Monk (No Archetype)

Level 13 Sorcerer + level 4 Dragon Knight

Level 13 Fighter + level 4 Hell Knight

Level 17 Nature/Trickery Cleric

Level 17 Crossbow wielding Paladin (Allowing Ranged Smites with specific limited bolts)

Level 17 Shadowsworn

For plot reasons everyone will have all their abilities and health replenished right before the fight and each one given a one use passive revive from the dead.

&amp;#x200B;

So the boss fight takes place in a hell like pocket dimension known as the Wailing Void, a veritable sea of Demonic creatures with a small (250 feet from end to end) archipelago of Obsidian islands where the fight takes place. Due to plot reasons they can cross pass between islands by walking on the demonic waters jesus style because of plot reasons as long as they can make a Wisdom saving throw (DC not decided).

&amp;#x200B;

The first phase stars the boss as a Jabberwock (Lore wise the boss is NOT a Jabberwock, it's a destruction god using one as it's physical form) backed up by two Obsicidaemons, one Vrolikai Demon, and 7 rounds, back up from an Immolation Devil.

&amp;#x200B;

Once all five enemies are beaten there is a one round pause then all the corpses merge together to form a Demonic Tarrasque (Again, not the actual one, just using the stats) that can cycle through elemental damage every round.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the Tarrasque is brought to zero health it's heart is exposed and The Cross Bow Paladin will get one (At Advantage due to Divine intervention) shot with the world's one and only God Slaying Bolt to kill the God of Destruction once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a quick One-Roll Town generator I built with a mechanic I'm calling the Blunderbuss Engine - rolling a full standard set of 7 dice at once. Its great for rolling multiple tables at once, but it also presents some fantastic soft metrics to qualify the roll. This system uses the most basic application of these soft metrics, the location of the dice on the table, to build a town map.

Roll up a few towns and see what you think. It gives some great variation from the typical ""inn, tavern, and whatever shop you need right now"" format.

I like to work on silly/fun builds in my spare time, and lately I've been trying to replicate the Energy Sword-wielding Elites from the Halo franchise. I'd love your input on how you'd do it, the build or suggestion doesn't have to be good, just fun!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have so far for ideas:

1. The weapon could be one of three things: a Pata ([http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pata](http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pata)), a Scizore ([http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Scizore](http://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Scizore)), or a Kineticist's Kinetic Blade.
2. The Enigma Mesmerist ([http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Mesmerist%20Enigma](http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Mesmerist%20Enigma)) gives the character an easy way to turn invisible, as well as sneak attack.
3. The Unchained Rogue would work well after a few levels of Enigma.
4. A Vigilante or even a Zealot Vigilante ([http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Vigilante%20Zealot](http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Vigilante%20Zealot)) could also work for a character more similar to the Arbiter. 
5. Kineticists can get the Kinetic Blade Wild Talent, which lets them wield their blasts as a weapon. The Kineticist can even make this weapon out of Plasma once they have access to both Air and Fire blasts.
6. Furthermore, we could double down on the Kineticist route and take the Kinetic Knight archetype ([http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Kineticist%20Kinetic%20Knight](http://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Kineticist%20Kinetic%20Knight)) so that we can use the blade more often and wear heavier armor/shields.

That's what I have so far, what do you guys have?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Pathfinders!&lt;/p&gt;

\+2 to: con, cha dex

is amphibious (can breath under water and on land)

it seems pretty straight forward, but then our dm said that each of these bonuses is not a total price for the total enhancement but a total price for that cost.  So we've been playing like the following:

regular sword is 15gp
+1 is 2000, so total cost is now 2015gp
to add flaming, which is also a +1 enhancement, it would be 2000 but that would make my weapon essentially a +2 (2 enhancements) so it would cost 8000, so total cost is now 10015gp for a +1 flaming sword.

But then if you find a +1 flaming weapon in your loot and you go to sell it, it's never worth 10kgp, so i, already confused about the cost, did some research to try and figure it out and i stumbled on another thread that said its [paraphrasing] ""its the cost of the enhancement minus the cost of the previous enhancement""

so if this is true then it would make the above example different as such:

+1 is 2k gold
flaming is 8k gold (acting as a +2 because its the second enhancement) MINUS the previous enhancement of 2k gold, making it 6k gold and thus bringing the total cost to 8k gold (not 10 like i previously thought)

&amp;#x200B;

My wife's character is the leader of an underground freedom fighter group, very on point and logical. My character is partially mad after being tortured by an evil cult and seeks revenge but I play her as a happy-go-lucky bombastic bard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, also he hates metagaming, which is why he goes into detail how a monster/trap/magical item/obvious evil guy waiting to screw us over before we get there. But we can't act on it, we HAVE to play it straight. After a while it gets too hard to know what our characters not know, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

The game started out us saving his GF's character from an evil nation of undead and we needed to track down her father (for some reason he never explained). With the nation after us, the others at war with each other, we had to bob and weave our way to safety. Sounds like an interesting plot hook right? Too bad once we got to where the father SHOULD have been the DM decided he just wasn't. This DM doesn't make plot hooks or give us any direction. The above situation was just the party trying to find an adventure. This was also just him making stuff up on the fly and shoving 'I don't want you to do that' rules on us. In real world time this has taken us over a year of playing. We are giving no direction or purpose for anything. There is no plot at this point, we dropped the father thing and the nation of undead because the other party members have no stake in it or care. Even the DM doesn't care. Why are our characters hanging together again? 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason he spends nearly every session preventing characters, mostly mine, from doing anything. By this point in the game after a year of playing the time for the other party members for doing stuff takes minimum effort (like find ingredients for a new and undiscovered poison and make it in half a day) and the DM placed far more time on what they were doing. When it came to us to buy something it took us the whole session. Not the actual act of buying it. The items we wanted or needed would be either in too little amounts or not there at all. I'd have to make them. Then he goes full economics, every ingredient I needed, where to find every ingredient, build a still to make the alcohol needed for said item (this he made me explain in detail how I did that and roll for every act to see if I mess it up), make trade deals, etc etc etc. All I want are either healing potions or a magical brew that usually is available, nothing too crazy. Then to prevent progress from going too quickly for me he makes my character drunk, possessed, or knock out tired nearly every session.

&amp;#x200B;

So, finally, here is what happened. My character, my wife's character are over a continent away from their objectives. We missed a session or two and now we are trapped manning a store while the others go on adventures. We are basically NPCs now. During that TEN hour game session I tried to talk to him during any breaks for the other group for some way to have an NPC take over while my wife and I explore the town, find the party and help, or anything to play. Nope, our characters had to train NPCs to do our jobs so we could leave. Even when I told him what I wanted to do by summoning my Master for a chat, he metagamed knowing I was up to something, and gave a reason my Master was busy (even after I made sure he wasn't). That exchange alone took less than a minute and he passed it off as a distraction before going back to the other party. (The other party members noticed and hate that he's doing this too). The worst part is he doesn't even notice he's doing it. He forgets easily, changing rulings he doesn't remember he already made, and gets distracted by his GF who clearly doesn't want to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about it being too long, we just don't know what to do. We've talked to him before but that isn't getting us anywhere. We want to play, we want to have fun with friends, we want to have adventures. What should we do?

The basic idea is going to be a fairly normal Barbarian 2 / Oracle 4+ / Rage Prophet 10 build (depending on how many levels the character can get, of course.)  I'm not focusing on being any particular race - I'll probably leave that up to the RP/design of the character, rather than mechanics.

**Base Attributes**: Str 15, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 16.  The +2 can go anywhere, but since we're going to be a Str-based melee fighter for most of our career, +2 Str seems likely (giving us 18 at 4th level.)  Alternatively, do 14 Str and you can get 12 Dex for the +1 bonus, or 12 Wis for the +1 Will bonus.

**Oracle Class Features**:  For the Mystery, Life is pretty attractive; we're only guaranteed to get to pick two revelations, and it has some good ones.  Life Link seems practically required for anyone taking the Life mystery given how it can soften damage taken by the party.  Energy Body seems like the most versatile and useful second choice, offering a way to throw a bit of healing to party members (and it lets you move through their space without issues!), and gives you the ability to weakly heal yourself as a move action.  Not terrible.  Safe Curing is considerably less good from an action economy perspective, but not having to worry about provoking while casting healing spells could be useful.  The final option would be Enhanced Cures - allowing even a CLW to heal for a fair amount of healing.  Energy Body seems the most generally useful of the three, though... particularly given the reactive damage it deals to undead (a pretty common enemy type.)  You could also pick up Channel Positive Energy, but being good at channeling is pretty feat-heavy and we're probably going to be strapped for feats, and 1+Cha times per day is unimpressive.  Spellscar is an alternative mystery, although one I don't see as being quite as useful to the party.  For our purposes, Lame is the only real option we have for a curse - immunity to fatigue at Oracle 5th is entirely too strong to pass up, and Barbarian's Fast Movement feature counteracts the movement speed penalty!

**Barbarian Class Features**: Obviously, we have to take Moment of Clarity at Barbarian 2nd.  I don't see any archetypes worth taking since we will likely only ever have 2 levels of Barbarian and Uncanny Dodge is way too good to throw away for something like DR 1/- or other 2nd level things.  Our focus, instead, is on what to do while spending ""free"" feats on Extra Rage Power.  Perfect Clarity is a decent extension since we have to take Moment of Clarity, and Ultimate Clarity with rage cycling via the Lame curse is incredibly potent.  The other obvious choice is for a line of totem powers: it's a bit unconventional, but the Atavism Totem line has some real promise here.  The bite attack is kind of whatever (since core races generally don't get a bite attack to begin with, and it's likely to be a secondary attack anyhow), but Ferocity is extremely good (particularly with something like Safe Curing, guaranteeing the ability to heal yourself out of a tight spot) and Trample has some interesting applications combined with Energy Body.  Beast Totem is, of course, still the best ""general purpose"" line, because pounce is just amazing.  Picking up Superstition at some point is obviously recommended if at all possible.

**Equipment**:  Sword and board and the best armor we can wear.  Our attribute budget doesn't allow for much in the way of Dex and rage further reduces our AC, so we really need that shield bonus to compensate together with being unable to wear heavy armor.  Using the Armored Hulk archetype is an option, but if I'm understanding the Lame curse correctly, this would reduce us to a paltry 15 ft while wearing armor... not good.  Not being subject to encumbrance (weight) concerns is nice, meaning we don't generally need to waste money on mithral equipment.

Suggestions, ideas?  The concept feels kind of like a divine answer to the Bloodrager, if not quite as cohesive.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not worried too much about the nitty gritty right now, since that will inevitably vary based on the scenario/campaign and party makeup, but I&amp;#39;d like to get some basics hammered out and make sure I&amp;#39;m not missing things or misunderstanding things.  The basic idea is going to be a fairly normal Barbarian 2 / Oracle 4+ / Rage Prophet 10 build (depending on how many levels the character can get, of course.)  I&amp;#39;m not focusing on being any particular race - I&amp;#39;ll probably leave that up to the RP/design of the character, rather than mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: Str 15, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 16.  The +2 can go anywhere, but since we&amp;#39;re going to be a Str-based melee fighter for most of our career, +2 Str seems likely (giving us 18 at 4th level.)  Alternatively, do 14 Str and you can get 12 Dex for the +1 bonus, or 12 Wis for the +1 Will bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracle Class Features&lt;/strong&gt;:  For the Mystery, Life is pretty attractive; we&amp;#39;re only guaranteed to get to pick two revelations, and it has some good ones.  Life Link seems practically required for anyone taking the Life mystery given how it can soften damage taken by the party.  Energy Body seems like the most versatile and useful second choice, offering a way to throw a bit of healing to party members (and it lets you move through their space without issues!), and gives you the ability to weakly heal yourself as a move action.  Not terrible.  Safe Curing is considerably less good from an action economy perspective, but not having to worry about provoking while casting healing spells could be useful.  The final option would be Enhanced Cures - allowing even a CLW to heal for a fair amount of healing.  Energy Body seems the most generally useful of the three, though... particularly given the reactive damage it deals to undead (a pretty common enemy type.)  You could also pick up Channel Positive Energy, but being good at channeling is pretty feat-heavy and we&amp;#39;re probably going to be strapped for feats, and 1+Cha times per day is unimpressive.

Since then I have played a couple MT's and a few others and came to the conclusion that they are the worst prestige class there is core wise. Let's look at why I think they are the worst.

You need to be able to cast 2 nd level spells of arcane and divine, meaning you must be at least 3 levels in a arcane class and 3 levels in a divine class.

Not only are you very little help to your party on both damage and healing you lose out on having a decent amount of high end spells. Essentially you will be 3 levels behind everyone else. This is truly what makes MT the worst prestige class. It's a shame because it has a lot to offer like 

Doubling spell slots for either divine or arcane. 

Able to cast a arcane and divine spells at the same time at different targets or the same target and get pluses for doing the latter on spell resistance checks.

Decent ref, wil, and fort saves with a decent BAB progression.

All the armor and weapon proficiency of a cleric.

But the fact that you essentially cut your Achilles tendon to play this class really overshadows these benefits, not to mention when your other party members are expecting a fireball or a cure medium wounds but all ya got is magic missile and cure light wounds you're hurting the party and it just continues this way. 

But anyways tell me what you all think? How would you make the class work better? Do you think it needs fixing? Am I being a baby? What do you think? Personally I think if it was just you need to be a 2nd lvl arcane and divine instead of what it is so you can prestige at lvl 4 instead of 6 would fix it just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few years of experience of pathfinder, not 2e, I have DMed a few time filler sessions when our current DM is unavailable. This year my group will be finishing a campaign we have spent probably about 2 - 3 years playing and I have volunteered to pick us up for the next game.

I have bought the Curse of the Crimson throne hard cover book with all the chapters along with having the occult book and bestiary 1 - 5, I have notepads ready for myself along with printing out a few of the enemy npc stats on paper. We're using roll20 to play on as no party member lives in the same state and some even in other countries.

The party composition is:

1. Monk who has a tiger animal companion,
2. Sorceress who has built in as a charisma caster
3. A Malefex
4. and a Rock Star

An odd group but I just want them to have fun.

Any tips on handling the story would be greatly appreciated. I feel like the book lays everything out fairly well and leaves room for DMs to shift things as needed but I also know that there are probably problems others have ran into and I would be terribly grateful to any insight that can be given before this happens.

&lt;p&gt;Would appreciate the input b/c I love the character concept (ex-warpriest of an evil god converted to a good god and swore to lay his arms and armor down to atone for his sins, but also has to try and keep undercover so he&amp;#39;s not discovered by agents of the evil god with ease.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: INcase anyone stumbles upon this later, &lt;a href=""/u/Nyrocthul""&gt;/u/Nyrocthul&lt;/a&gt; found an answer in the Paizo FAQs which clears it up; &lt;a href=""https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fn#v5748eaic9thg""&gt;https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fn#v5748eaic9thg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR you can use multiple archetypes if they modify different parts of the same class feature without replacing the whole feature.&lt;/p&gt;

Two really newbie questions, but it appears that in my basking of new year pleasures, I seem to have forgotten how pathfinder works.

A [Flying Blade](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler/archetypes/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes/flying-blade/) Swashbuckler with 2 levels dipped into Warpriest to get Shoot Star and the ability to swift cast on myself.

So, first question is pretty simple. How do I get my knives back early...or like, ever?

[Returning](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/returning/) seems like an obvious pick, but super expensive. So, early, I wouldn't be able to do much unless I carry multiple knives or get into melee after tossing.    
[Called](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/called/) was another option I was looking at. I'd lose a swift action, but they aren't super important to me. I could move before and after throwing without worrying about my knife hitting my empty square. Still expensive.    
[Blinkback Belt](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-blink-back/) is my last option, but I'm iffy on it. It specifically states **the weapon teleports back to its strap or sheath immediately after the attack is resolved**. Would my comet attacks land? Or would it just return after the first hit? The ambiguity makes me weary. Expensive, but it isn't limited to just one weapon. Also lose the belt slot, but my headband increases my to hit and damage. I'd have to have quickdraw to make it even work, but it would let me throw and quickdraw for Parry and Reposte.



Next up is [Startoss](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-style-combat-style/) and Melee Damage. In spite of the name, it reads like you can apply that bonus damage to melee attacks too.    
**""While using this style and the chosen weapon, you gain a bonus on damage rolls made with the weapon""**    
It does not clarify that it has to be thrown. This would make the build a lot more flexible. If this were the case, I wouldn't be as squeamish about getting into melee. I did find a [forum discussing this issue](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2txjg?Startoss-style-and-melee-damage), siting the writer as it should apply to melee.    

She's starting off at level 2, so I'll have to just carry extra knives until I get a solution. Throw, move+draw to prep for parry. Rinse and repeat.    
What do you guys think? How would you feel bringing a build like this to a table that has so much interpretation involved?

&lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/called/""&gt;Called&lt;/a&gt; was another option I was looking at. I&amp;#39;d lose a swift action, but they aren&amp;#39;t super important to me. I could move before and after throwing without worrying about my knife hitting my empty square. Still expensive.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-blink-back/""&gt;Blinkback Belt&lt;/a&gt; is my last option, but I&amp;#39;m iffy on it. It specifically states &lt;strong&gt;the weapon teleports back to its strap or sheath immediately after the attack is resolved&lt;/strong&gt;. Would my comet attacks land? Or would it just return after the first hit? The ambiguity makes me weary. Expensive, but it isn&amp;#39;t limited to just one weapon. Also lose the belt slot, but my headband increases my to hit and damage. I&amp;#39;d have to have quickdraw to make it even work, but it would let me throw and quickdraw for Parry and Reposte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;a href=""https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-style-combat-style/""&gt;Startoss&lt;/a&gt; and Melee Damage. In spite of the name, it reads like you can apply that bonus damage to melee attacks too.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;While using this style and the chosen weapon, you gain a bonus on damage rolls made with the weapon&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It does not clarify that it has to be thrown. This would make the build a lot more flexible. If this were the case, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be as squeamish about getting into melee. I did find a &lt;a href=""https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2txjg?Startoss-style-and-melee-damage""&gt;forum discussing this issue&lt;/a&gt;, siting the writer as it should apply to melee.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s starting off at level 2, so I&amp;#39;ll have to just carry extra knives until I get a solution. Throw, move+draw to prep for parry. Rinse and repeat.&lt;br/&gt;
What do you guys think? How would you feel bringing a build like this to a table that has so much interpretation involved? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing to see here. Desna&amp;#39;s Shooting Star isn&amp;#39;t legal. Move along.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a new character sketch I just completed for a Pathfinder player who is going through the Strang Aeons Adventure Path!

&amp;#x200B;

Adelais is a Void Touched Sorcerer who has just awoken in an asylum and fought his way through the undead and worse horrors with a group of adventurers, all who have no memories of themselves before these events. This Chelaxian is slowly becoming the face of the party as he has high charisma and is a natural leader. Though he does not remember his past he wears a spiraling comet pendant around his neck, the symbol of the Goddess Pharasma. There is a second neclace holding a single pearl as well. Finally, Adelais has just found a featureless copper mask, a relic from his past, pulling him closer to the truth of who he is.

This was an extremely fun sketch to do with all of the details provided and the chance to create a character summoning magic from the darkness between the stars. Let me know if you'd like your character sketched as well!

She'd like to play it in a PFS game.  She's indifferent to the main character's class and will happily replace the main mini with anything else that works.  

Essentially the only goal is to play a character with a pet that fits the miniature.

The problem is PFS does not allow animal companions (such as a chimpanzee) to use weapons, and only a limited number of familiars can use weapons (that list is mostly stuff like specific fey &amp; outsiders and does not include monkeys).

Can anyone think of a PFS legal workaround?
 
A few more thoughts:

* The monkey doesn't have to be a powerhouse (it likely won't be), but it does need to be a combatant on the map.
* Ideally it’d be a permanent pet (such as a monkey familiar or chimpanzee animal companion) rather than a summon.
* I recognize a monkey-shaped eidolon could work but only want to fall back on that if it’s the only way.
* Primates *are* allowed to *hold* a weapon, but typically can't wield it.
* The monkey needn't necessarily attack with the dagger but it should have some reason to hold it.  E.g. if there were an equipment-trick feat for knives that gave a bonus without requiring the holder to actually wield it (to my knowledge there isn't).
* The monkey can be modified to include things like templates (e.g. some archetypes might make it something like a celestial or entropic monkey) but it should still generally be a small primate and not something like a polymorphed imp.

I have been trying to do research on good ways to cast daylight and have come across very few things that actually say something to the effect of ""this item casts daylight"". Alternatively I have found several items that say some variation of ""creates light like a daylight spell"".

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a minor difference until you consider the darkness magic negating effect of the actual daylight spell. I wanted to know if these wordings actually mean something different or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I have included a few examples below (specifically ones I am considering as I am looking for something slotless).

&amp;#x200B;

If these don't include the negation effect because they don't ACTUALLY cast daylight then what are some items that do, preferably at a cost that is realistic for PFS?(I also am avoiding potions/oils because character concept/don't want to item manage for this character, but if that ends up my only option I will do it if I have to)

There are 2 other players in the campaign and honestly, I want them to get more out of it too but the necromancer is just really taking the cake with killing everything for them basically and it&amp;#39;s kind of taking the fun out of it.&lt;br/&gt;
If there&amp;#39;s more info you guys would like I do have screenshots of his character sheet, but I would really appreciate it if I could get some help understanding if this is all right and I&amp;#39;m just being dumb, or if he&amp;#39;s really messing with me.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve almost killed his character a couple of times, but never his creatures, so I don&amp;#39;t want to be throwing cr 7 or 9 at them just because of the undead creatures&lt;br/&gt;
Note:&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also asked him to explain it to me - but the way he does also confuses me. With 3 other people saying different things I am just a little lost lol.&lt;br/&gt;
I just don&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; want to seem like that douchey DM that changes things up mid-campaign but if I have to I will &lt;/p&gt;

The game is an arena campaign, where players take on the role of one of the various gods of death from different worlds.

 Each player creates a stable of 8 first level characters, and battle throughout various matches to see which God will become the one and only god of death. Characters must be Core classes, though archetypes are allowed (clear it with me first just to be sure)

When a match is over, all surviving characters gain a level, and the god (the player) gains some gold to spend on upgrading their gear. Characters slain in battle are resurrected, at least until they reach 10th lvl, at which point death is final.

The characters you create don’t need to be complex, and the major portion of the role play will happen between the god themselves as each battles, betrays, allies, gambles, and tricks their way to a final victory.

If We can get enough players, this should be a fantastic game, but the roll 20 LFG just isn’t getting the word out.

So if this game sounds interesting and fun to you, let me know, and I’ll send a game invite and a link to the discord where you can plan out your characters and meet the other players I have.

If I get enough of a response I’ll even up the number of players from 8, so this could get really big if a lot of you want to join.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am running a Roll20 Pathfinder 1.0 campaign on Sundays starting this Sunday and I need 5 more people for a total of 8.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your requests! I'm putting a cap on new requests for now, as I have SO MANY WONDERFUL CHARACTERS TO DRAW :D. However, I'm still taking paid commissions, so message away if you're so inclined. Again, thank you, thank you for generously sharing the creative characters that you've been adventuring with.  Have a wonderful season!

Hey rpfam! I'm reviving a post I made around a year ago. I'm offering to draw your Pathfinder character for FREE! Once finished, I'll post the drawing here on reddit for all to see, and for you to use as you like (hopefully you'll give me credits where needed\~ ).

Check the link at the top to see some of the previous characters I've done for you creative folks, and if you'd like to follow me on the socials, check me out on Instagram and Twitch @eastghoster. I'm sure to be drawing your requests on stream.

If you'd like to see your hero drawn, shoot me a PM with your character description. A deep backstory (while super cool!) isn't as helpful as age/race/class/alignment/personality/weapons/clothes/armor or any other relevant visual stuff.

If you're a kind soul, and you'd like to help a girl out, you can also become a patron on my Patreon page: [https://www.patreon.com/user?u=10409196](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=10409196), or you can request a paid commission, and I'll get to yours first (hello Christmas!).

Hope you're all having a great end of the year. I can't wait to read your descriptions!

First up, Ludarac for /u/jm201201 !

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;About my character, His name is Ludarac, he is a Dhampir Magus. Tall and slender with a prime musculature, he has shoulder length brown hair and amber eyes with pale skin. He is chaotic beutral but has secret evil plans. He wears black leather armor, wields a rapier in one hand and ice magic in the other. He does have a very refined and noble face with a hints of his vampiric nature underneath. He also is very fond of thunderstorms and killing vampires.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xy3svofntb221.jpg

Next, it's Khanu for /u/BlitheringWither!

&gt;Khanu is a middle-aged Vanaran who worships Zon-Kuthon. Scars cover the left side of his torso and his left arm where fur no longer grows. He keeps a spiked chain wrapped around his chest for melee combat but prefers to fight at a distance with his composite longbow. While typically jovial and quite the prankster, he's quick to anger and shows his evil side.

I was wondering if there&amp;#39;s maybe an object or something that I dont know about, that puts out heat/light enough to be campfire-like, but doesn&amp;#39;t weigh 20lbs for a single night&amp;#39;s use?&lt;br/&gt;
Sorry if this isn&amp;#39;t the right place for this!&lt;/p&gt;

So, if I shove a [Opalescent White Pyramid Ioun Stone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones/opalescent-white-pyramid-ioun-stone/) into my [Wayfinder](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/) it grants me Weapon Focus for the inscribed weapon on the stone. Here's where my questions come in.


* Does any version of this stone cause this effect? Or do I have to chip out for an expensive one? The text on Wayfinder says *""All ioun stones of a particular color and shape react exactly the same way to all wayfinders.""* Does this mean I could buy a cracked one for 1,500 gp and it still provides Weapon Focus?    

* If granted Weapon Focus this way, does it still complete prerequisites for other feats? Such as Weapon Versatility or Dazzling Display or any of the other 100 feats that require it?    

* If I lose my Wayfinder, I lose the feat. So I'm assuming that all feats that require it effectively ""turn off"" until I reacquire my magic compass?

* If all of this is correct, all of this is PFS legal, correct?

Played my first Core module with my first sorcerer recently, and I felt a little underwhelmed by the performance in combat.

Stats were 8, 15, 14, 12, 10, and 18, with the three (provided I ever get a chance to play past 33 XP) stat boosts going into Dex once and Charisma twice.

My spells so far are Magic Missile and Color Spray, with my only attack cantrip being Acid Splash. I'm not sure if I could really be more effective by changing those at only level 2.

I've been told it will be a ""murder mystery"" based in a noble kingdom with lots of politics, and enough stigma against ""human half-breeds.""

I plan to play an Inquisitor for this campaign. Specifically, an Immolator. I love Ifrit and I think it could be a lot of fun playing a hot headed agent of a god. I wanted to play something interesting that isn't a fighter, this feels like it. 

Problem is, I've never played an Inquisitor, and for that matter have avoided devotion to Gods in general with my characters. Hence why I'm here, what have you done and what are your ideas? Were you a zealous crusader ready to burn heathens on a cross, or were you a subtle, resolved dealer of Justice?

Update: Well, Ifrit and Immolators are kind of garbage in comparison to other combinations. I do like the thought of Oread however.

Im thinking Iomedae or Erastil. Iomedae fits well from a roleplay and motivation aspect, but Erastil is tempting with the punch ranged fighting packs with Wis bonus instead of Dex.

At level 5, what do you guys think of Str 12, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 12?

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I know this is silly, but I would love to hear your guys&amp;#39; thoughts on what would fit best, both for flavor, and mechanically. My group is also pretty open to homebrew, so any creative feat, trait, or pun name ideas would be very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

I was just thinking about the previous campaign I was in with my Half Orc Ranger that was a part of a secret druid community that lived in a grove deep in a forest. I am a very curious player and am sometimes a nuisance to my party because I am always sniffing around. Constantly people watching and trying to be aware of my surroundings.

One day, we stroll into a really big and important city to talk to basically a high priest. I just recall there being one hell of a mission involving clockwork beings and it was intense. Anywho, when we first got into the town, I go into ""need to buy some supplies"" mode and find this run down little cheese shop. Of course, not without plenty of groaning and complaining, I go in. The place was a MESS and the poor ragged man who owned it barely had ANY cheese. I genuinely just wanted to get some snacks for the road but something about this poor man and his stories of misfortune struck a chord with me. I also loved the cheese and had even somehow got an appraisal on it that told me it was some AMAZING cheese. Well, being the half orc ranger found and raised by druids, I tipped him very generously without thinking of how much I actually gave him. Living in a grove with a bunch of druids, ya don't really have too much use for money, ya know? He was so grateful, he ended up giving me the rest of the cheese in his shop!

So here I am walking around this big city with a bunch of cheese and we enter the ""rich"" area of town that is separate from the ""poor"" part of town. No high priest is going to be mingling with the commoners, ya know? WE make our way to the nearest inn and start shmoozing the the inn keeper. I don't recall how, but I ended up leaving some cheese with the inn keeper of this super shwanky inn. I think he was super hungry and I had a bunch of cheese while trying to shmooze him, so I offered him some of it. Eventually, we move on with the mission, complete our quest, and leave the city.

Fast forward, like a week or two and we had to return to the city to visit the high priest again. As we enter the ""rich"" area, I hear a bunch of yelling from the side and get pummeled by someone. It is the poor ragged man, only, dude has the cleanest threads and looks like a brand new man! Turns out, between the tip I left and giving the cheese to the rich inn keeper, I made this guy one of the richest people in the city! He took the tip I gave him and made a shit load more of his cheese! Turns out, the inn keeper loved the cheese so damn much that he sought it out and found the ragged man with all of his newly created cheese! He now supplies most of the cheese to the higher class in the city, was able to move into the nicer part of town, and opened up a brand new shop that has a damn line coming out of the door all the time! As a thank you, he dumped a shit load of money on me and told me I can always come back for free cheese :).

we're about to start a new game in a **low magic** setting that starts and ends at **level 6.** The general setting is a kind of van Hellsing monster hunter setting, mainly lycanthropes as enemies, maybe a few demons and devils according to the gm.

So fitting the theme i thought i'd do a repeating crossbow build like in the van hellsing movie and because i can't remember anyone ever trying to do crossbow build. And now i know why - crossbows really suck compared to bows and even more (naturally) compared to the standard 2 handed Weapon build. But whatever. Brief research made it clear that the only way to make it kind of work is the **Bolt Ace** variant for the Crossbow Training of the gunslinger. So we'll stick with that. But since we only need 5 levels of Bolt Ace i was wondering what i should take for 6th.

Two options crossed my minds:

1. Ranger for the favored enemy since we'll mostly be fighting Human(Humanoid) sub types. Also the tracking feature sounds very fitting for the hunter kind of setting.
2. Fighter to use the bonus talent to grab **Vital Strike** on level 6. With the d10 damage dice i think that would a decent option.

Sample build looks like this:

15 points stat buy (rules also say no stat above 14 before racial and level up adjustments. Additonally we get 2x1 attribute points on level 4 instead of 1x1)

**Vanara Bolt Ace**

STR 10

DEX 18 (14 + 2 + 2)

Con 14

Int 10

Wis 16 (14 + 2)

CHA 8 (10 - 2 )

&amp;#x200B;

**Weapon**: Heavy, repeating Crossbow

**Feats**: 

Level 1: Point-Blank Shot

Level 3: Deadly Aim

Level 4: Precise Shot (Gunslinger Bonus feat)

Level 5: ?

&amp;#x200B;

I am intentionally not going the Crossbow Mastery/Rapid Reload way and instead try a one shot/one kill kind of route to try and make as much use of the sharp shoot deed.

 **Sharp Shoot (Ex)** At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed’s cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs .  


 Ideally i try to stay in stealth with my 120 ft range and hopefully don\`t even need to reload during the fight.  


Every input is welcome :)

Through backstory, he’s bestowed with the power to summon this Eidolon to his aid. The only thing is, it’s a 1 minute ritual to summon. Which means, whenever we jump in to combat, it would take me 10 rounds to get my Eidolon out, during which time my feeble old fella is likely to bite the dust. Summoning beforehand is circumstantial and doesn’t work if we’re surprised. Without the Eidolon, my character is pretty useless combat-wise, so I was talking to my DM about allowing the summon as a standard action. I know some have also said about summoning at the start of the day and just keeping it out, but I also don’t want to walk around town or talk to NPC’s, meet with royals, barter with merchants, cook, sail, etc while enshrouded in a monstrous murder machine. I was thinking more of a symbiotic/The Guyver type situation. 
I also said that outside of my dismissing the Eidolon, if it’s dismissed for any other reason - death, banishment, other magic, etc. - that I would need to use the ritual to resummon it back the first time. So basically I summon it back, then it just goes in to hiding when not in use. 
If there’s a penalty or balance you suggest for this too, I’m all ears. And I know disguise self and all that, but I’m starting at level 1 and I don’t wanna burn a spell slot just to walk down the street every single time haha. 
Lemme know what you all think. I don’t think it should be too game breaking right? I basically wanna use it like summoned armor. If you have a better way or doing this as well, please share. Maybe a feat or something I missed. Thanks!

**tl;dr:** I don’t want to need 10 rounds every time we get in combat to summon my Eidolon, but I also don’t want to walk around with the summoner form out when I’m just being casual. Asking my DM if it can be a standard action just to summon my Eidolon as a Synthesist. Will that be ok?

Summoning beforehand is circumstantial and doesn’t work if we’re surprised. Without the Eidolon, my character is pretty useless combat-wise, so I was talking to my DM about allowing the summon as a standard action. I know some have also said about summoning at the start of the day and just keeping it out, but I also don’t want to walk around town or talk to NPC’s, meet with royals, barter with merchants, cook, sail, etc while enshrouded in a monstrous murder machine. I was thinking more of a symbiotic/The Guyver type situation. 
I also said that outside of my dismissing the Eidolon, if it’s dismissed for any other reason - death, banishment, other magic, etc. - that I would need to use the ritual to resummon it back the first time. So basically I summon it back, then it just goes in to hiding when not in use. 
If there’s a penalty or balance you suggest for this too, I’m all ears. And I know disguise self and all that, but I’m starting at level 1 and I don’t wanna burn a spell slot just to walk down the street every single time haha. 
Lemme know what you all think. I don’t think it should be too game breaking right? I basically wanna use it like summoned armor. If you have a better way or doing this as well, please share. Maybe a feat or something I missed. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t want to need 10 rounds every time we get in combat to summon my Eidolon, but I also don’t want to walk around with the summoner form out when I’m just being casual. Asking my DM if it can be a standard action just to summon my Eidolon as a Synthesist. Will that be ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Someone pointed out that I posted this in the Society sub. Apologies, wasn’t paying enough attention when posting. This is for a homebrew casual game with friends. &lt;/p&gt;

But i&amp;#39;m looking for some good resources on how to DM so i can get a full time campaign running. I&amp;#39;m also hoping you guys might have some suggestions for good pre-made campaigns, and some good ways to keep the budget down for maps and stuff.

For most people, this would be a cause for celebration... not so much in her case. Not only did she feel that her character wouldn't use magic (and that Rangers having magic in general was a bit strange), but she was also horrified at the thought of having to remember a load more stuff that her character could do.

I tried. I reskinned most of the L1 Ranger spells to be non-magical (Delay Poison is now a concoction that she can prepare from herbs and roots, Pass Without Trace is now the ability to effectively hide her tracks by mundane means, Calm Animals is now kinda like that scene from Crocodile Dundee with the bull (showing my age there) and so on...) but she still isn't happy about only being able to use them once per day (not from a munchkin perspective, but because it doesn't make sense to her that you could only do the Crocodile Dundee trick once every 24 hours unless it was magic), and there are still too many for her to keep track of.

My other solution is a bit more extreme; I'm considering letting her pick individual spells (one at this level, then as per her spell slots) and have them as at-will abilities, kind of like non-magical cantrips.  My concern is that this might be a bit OP - it's limiting in one respect, in that she only has access to one Ranger spell/ability instead of the fifteen or so L1 spells - but the flipside is that she's effectively going to have multiple uses-per-day of that selected one. Ranger spells are pretty specific, it's true, so it's not like she's getting unlimited castings of Fireball, but I'm still wary of this approach.
