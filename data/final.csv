But nooo, they couldn't stop themselves and the first thing they did with the newly gained access to the city was to explore the dungeons and kill the guard death dogs, but I thought I'd let it slide,  and the city Mayor sent them to heal themselves of the death dogs disease. 

But they didn't want to pay the bill, the healer was the headmaster of the magic academy, so she almost killed one of the PCs, the other tried to escape and long story short. they all ended up in jail...

0,0,3,4,"I'm a bit of a new DM and I thought I would share this comical story with you guys. I've only done a few oneshots to great success, so I made the jump to a full blown campaign. Yesterday, to help my players get familiar with one another and the system (a lot of them were new to DnD) I sent them to an Ikea (called ""Idea"" in the world) to pick up a package. 

Unfortunately, the establishment was suffering a union riot.

After making it inside to the welcome desk, my players saw a plain, wooden obelisk next to the way towards the next room. The obelisk has a single circular hole big enough for an arm. The obelisk also has writing around it saying things like ""Bet you're too scared to stick your arm in!"" or ""Only REAL adventurers are brave enough to stick their hands in!"" They also heard the odd sound of ""Cheep cheep cheep"" like a chicken calling out to them from some unseen shadow. They were wary of the obelisk, and would have avoided it until they inspected it a little more closely.  They saw an additional bit of writing saying ""You might be lucky to win a prize!"" Bait set.

The Dwarf of the team stuck her entire arm in the hole. The obelisk glowed a magical yellow starting from the bottom to the top. the moment it glowed around the arm their was a stinging sizzle and pop. No more right arm for the dwarf. She did get lucky though, and won a half-off coupon to ""Glitter's Prosthetic""

After nearly drowning in the bathroom department, the party found Glitter's shop in the kid's section of the store, where the dwarf got a new arm from Glitter, a kenku who looked a bit like a toucan, for the low price of 20 gold thanks for the coupon (they started with 25 gold each).

The Dwarf enjoys her new arm a lot, for it punches well. Glitter enjoys her newly collected coin, cooing ""cheep cheep cheep"" as she counts it.",dndnext,I stole a player's arm in Ikea and sold them a new one.

0,0,208,214,"I was reading I think the Alexandrian and came across a bit about why rolling 3d6 (or even 4d6 drop lowest) was an ideal way for players to discover their character. As usual I recoiled viscerally at rolling for stats. At my tables we always use point buy or standard arrays. It got me thinking, why do I feel so emotionally upset at the prospect of rolling stats (especially in order)?

I realized because that’s what life did to me and I play DnD to experience a simulation of a life more exciting and just downright better than real life. 

Life rolled 3d6 in order for me and everyone else. Im blessed it gave me an 11 or 12 or something in Intelligence. But the 5 or whatever it gave me in Constitution and all my chronic illnesses? Fuck that. Especially when, I selfishly and enviously, see people who rolled 18s or what have you in their stats. 

Life is unfair. I hope that I can make efforts to make it more fair for the people around me, but I know life is capricious and random. DnD is random. It literally involves rolling dice. But when it comes to who I am in this fantasy world, that randomness hurts. Just for this fleeting moment, it’s beautiful that my hero and my friends’ heroes all have the same array/point buy. We are all different. I am a nimble charming rogue whilst my friend is a powerful and wise healer. But in our differences we are equal. 

DnD is a fantasy. I want it to involve challenge and even heartbreak. But to roll 3d6 in order? Fuck that. I live in a world that does that and I hate it. 

EDIT:

to be clear:

I understand the value of 3d6 in order and that for some games/tables it is a good idea. 

It’s just that I have such a visceral reaction to it and I had an epiphany of sorts of why.

As our characters level, how do we thematically explain how our characters obtain these new fancy skills and abilities?

In regards to divine casters I think its a bit easier, for example:

You awake the next morning after a dream of your god (or what may have you) coming to you and blah blah you realize you have access to this new spell with the ability to know the somatic and verbal parts needed to cast it.

In regards to my future Kensei monk however, how would I explain that after X amount of weeks traveling with this group of people, he wakes up the next day and realizes he can speak and understand all spoken languages (Tongue of sun and moon)? Or the fighter realizing he can shoot an arrow that literally banishes the creature to another plan of existence (Banishing Arrow)?

My group had been playing Storm King's Thunder for almost a year and a half now, and after some crazy shenanigans we fought the last battle today against Iymrith, her two kids, and a bunch of purple wormlings today.  

Before the final battle, we got the Wyrm Claw and a potion of Giant Size.  Our leader, the Druid, got the Claw and my Sun Soul Monk, who does the most damage in melee, got the Potion of Giant Size.  So my DM really hates the Sun Soul Monk class.  He loves Monks, but the Sun Soul makes him angry because it can be a ranged monk, keeping the monk out of front line combat.

He played the Way of the Fist Monk in another campaign and he loved that character in combat.   He said it was high risk but high reward.

So, I'm pretty sure he did things to persuade me to go up and punch shit instead of spaming Hadoukens from 30 feet away.  Things like my character finding the Ilde Rune and him ruling I could add that extra D6 of fire damage to my punches (but specifically not the Hadoukens) and the Charm of the Slayer to my punches as well. I'm pretty sure that was because that feature annoyed of the class annoyed him so much.

Because of this, with Flurry of Blows, my damage was averaging about 45 per turn, out damaging the casters, fighter, rogue, and ranger at level 12 because it was consistent damage (20 points automatically if I make all four punches didn't hurt and my rolls are generally pretty decent). 

Now back to the Potion of Giant Size.  Normally it increases Strength, but he changed it due to my character being a petite wood elf, upping her Dex to 25 instead as well as tripling the amount of dice for each strike.

We got an army together and Harshnag (my monk's buddy - she was one of two people in the party who could speak giant, she actually knew what Force Gray was due to a good roll, was the one to first approach him to talk to him, and probably had the most interactions with him) to fight the dragons.

It was suggested that I didn't just gulp the potion right away (which in hind sight I should have, it would have made the entire battle easier).  So we killed the two adult blue dragons.  It was a fairly easy fight considering we were fighting two dragons (and I happened to double crit on a round of Flurry of Blows, which didn't hurt either).

Then of course Iymrith is pissed because we killed her kids, bursts out of the ground, and wrecks the party, knocking us back.  Poor Harshnag falls underground with the wormlings and we can't get within 20 feet of her because the ground around her is pretty much gone from her bursting out of it.  My now Giant Sized Wood Elf Monk has to throw some hadoukens, which was kind of hilarious when you think about it because they still did the normal amount of damage.

However, our druid leader had a great plan and managed to give us ground underneath the dragon again, bringing Harshnag into the fray once again as well.  Iymrith is still wrecking shit.  She kills our sorcerer to the point where he's failed two death saving throws.

Finally it's my turn again and Harshnag, our Fighter/Bard, an NPC Ranger (who is the GREATEST, but that's a story for another time), and I have flanked her, and our table has ruled that gives us Advantage if we're flanking an enemy (also gives enemies the same advantage as well).  I do Flurry of Blows with advantage on each of the four strikes.

Every one of them hits.

After I roll a lot of fucking dice I end up doing 141 points of damage, which was enough to finish the dragon.

But holy fucking shit, 141 points of damage as a giant elf literally beating a dragon to death with her fists.

I don't know if I'm ever going to top that in combat again.  I might have to retire as a melee player and switch to casters for a while, because holy shit I had a Kaiju Battle with a Dragon And Kicked Her Fucking Ass.

And, even more hilarious, my elf is super young.  She is literally just 18 years old.  Everything else is just going to be downhill from that.

Game

You are level 8 characters, and your goal is to kill the enemy team. Each team has a dragon egg that hatches into a young dragon (young black dragon stats, but they’re black/white in color). One egg is black, one egg is white. The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.

4 Zones

Forest:

Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a lightning storm. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 3d6 lightning damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Caves

A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled at the beginning of the round, acid begins to leak from the ceiling of the tunnels. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 3d6 acid damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Rocks

This area has a rocky surface with massive boulders jutting up from the ground. When a 3 is rolled at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the area. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 3d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Tower

The tower sits on a grassy surface, but the tower itself is 50 feet high and made of solid steel. The north and south sides of the tower have a hemp rope from top to bottom, and the east and west sides of the tower have metal chain ladders. A random level 6 spell scroll spawns at the top of the tower, and refreshes every three rounds. When a 4 is rolled at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a flames. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 3d6 fire damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Other stuff

Fountains

In each forested area, there is a fountain of regeneration. It has a pool of 100 health it can restore to those who drink from it. You can only heal at the fountain on your original side. You can damage the fountain to drain the remaining pool of health it has left. Fountain is immune to psychic damage, and has resistance to all damage besides magical bludgeoning damage.

Flames

In the white team side, a magical black flame exists in the rocky region. In the black team side, a magical white flame exists in the rocky region. This flame cannot be extinguished. Each player holds a magical bottle to capture some of this flame. When the flame is brought back to the egg of its respective color, it reduces the turns to hatch by 1. Players cannot hold more than one bottle at a time.

Death Slaad

He made this character with the mind of being able to hit with his light warhammer (He nerfed the damage).. and he ruled it so he can hit with a bonus action since it is a light weapon. Is this a feasible ruling? I've read that you can technically only hit with a weapon as a bonus if 1. it is light 2. you are dual-weilding a light in the main-hand/ off-hand, 3. You take the attack action with a weapon... I'm curious as to what anyone else thinks on the ruling. Imho, I am letting it slide, since my campaign is almost done anyway.

Monk (sunsoul) x/ Druid 2 (circle of spores)

The main idea here is to create utter chaos and confusion by wildshaping onto something very small, like and ant or spider, and then throwing monk sunbolts that seem to come out of nowhere.  Circle of spores has the best monk synergy in my opinion.

You could do things like creep onto a cave ceiling as a spider, rain down sunbolts, and drop down on an enemy once they figured it out or hit you with an AOE. If you could get to the enemy, you could transform back into a monk actually ON them.

However, he had a DMPC, our rogue, whom he had wanted to kill for months. So his set piece cinematic involved this rogue selling his soul to the goddess of luck for a stacked Deck of Many Things. He divined the nature of the lich's phylactery, spawned an amulet of planes to allow the rest of the party to escape, then destroyed the deck and himself at the same time. We were all very moved by his heroic sacrifice. After being transported to Bytopia, the god Garl Glittergold granted us a spelljammer ship to return home, as a sympathy gift.

I basically so far made him a Variant Human with Magic Initiate (for Guidance cantrip and Shield of Faith spell). With sword, shield and heavy armor, I have base AC of 18. Originally I had planned on picking the Protection fighting style, but I realized that with the build I was going for once I hit levels 3 and 4 I would have too many spells fighting over that one reaction.

Once I reach level 3 I'm picking up Shield, Absorb Elements and possibly Blade Ward. The entire playstyle I wanted to have was of a defensive/utility oriented character. But with so many abilities fighting over that reaction, I thought maybe I should switch to the Defense fighting style instead for that +1AC. If I do so, my concern becomes another one: What if the DM starts to make monster just ignore me since my AC is so obscenely high? (If I'm casting Blade Ward on myself or using cantrips during my actions, I will likely have my sword sheathed so the somatic components of spells isn't an issue even pre-War Caster). Then sure, I would have 19 base AC which could go up to 21 with Magic Initiate's Shield of Faith and then 26 with Shield of Faith + Shield.

0,0,13,0,"Druids get a lot of hate from people. They regularly appear low on everyone's tier list, and they are empirically the least played class. But they are fantastic. There are 3 reasons for this.

1. Wild shape is incredible. As a Moon druid it makes you the best tank and disabler in the game, edging out barbarian depending on opinion, and definitely at level 20. For any other circle it gives you an insane amount of flexibility anyway. You are now the best scout in the party, you now have every movement option (burrow, climb, fly, swim), you now have possibly the best disguise in the game outside a shapeshifter, you have an escape skill, you can break into places by turning into a spider without even needing to pick locks, and you can do it all twice on a short rest. Your very existence invalidates the party role of half the other classes. It is also the reason that Druids are probably the best one man party.
2. You are a full caster with a solid spell list for support.
3. Depending on DM ruling/on how kind your DM is in letting you influence, they have access to probably the two best spells in the entire game: Conjure animals (for 8 stags) and Conjure Woodland beings (for 8 pixies). This is a bit questionable, but even if your DM gives you other animals this can still be incredible, particularly as a circle of the Shepard giving them magic attacks and tripling their health with bear spirit.  


The only thing that they aren't good at is blasting. Their damage is fine (almost on par with fighters at low levels minus action surge) but not phenomenal (unless your DM is kind with animal selection for summon animals). But almost every other class does that to some degree. Further, I would encourage you to consider damage not in terms of damage/turn but rather in terms of damage before you die. Druids win the second hands down, even if their nova isn't so good.

In terms of subclasses, Moon and Sheperd are incredible. Moon makes you a godly tank. Shepherd makes everyone a godly tank, including the 8 minions you summoned at level 5 (looking at you bear spirit).

I've googled around a bit and saw a couple other people have subbed in a drider and messed with other things as well to make the Nezznar fight less underwhelming. I've decided to make this a two-stage fight with Nezznar transforming into a magic-enabled Drider after he and his spiders (making this a phase spider and giant spider instead of 4x Giant Spider) are killed.

The party consists of 5 players who will likely be level 5 by this fight. If they're level 4 I'll tone down the fight a bit

### Phase 1:

Nezznar (CR 2)

Phase spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/phase-spider) (CR 3)

Giant spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider) (CR 1)

Quasit Familiar (still debating whether or not to have this, might be a bit tricky) [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit) (CR 1)

If I do include the quasit I'd have it disguised as a tarantula tracking the party throughout the dungeon with a couple opportunities to spot it and eliminate it for this fight. Additionally, it will void the contract with Nezznar as soon as he goes down (doesn't matter if the spiders are still up).

### Phase 2:

Magic-enabled Drider [stat block](https://i.imgur.com/QE2ZT39.png)

Any spell slots spent in previous stage remain spent. Kept his ""mental"" stats the same as the previous stage.  I've been debating nerfing the HP, or possibly keeping him at lvl 4 spellcasting instead of upping it to 5 (a little worried about vampiric touch, but counterspell would be fun). I'll probably give the party a very brief respite between the two phases (not a short rest but the cleric *could* cast cure wounds once or twice).

My players have also been both a bit loose with their resources and quick to flee and rest so I imagine they'll find a way to get to this fight with either much more or much less resources than expected of the fight.

### DMG CR Estimate for drider vs modified drider

Drider:  
Defense CR: 10 (19 AC: 17, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (28.5/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13: 0)  
Overall CR: 6  

Magic-enabled Drider:  
Defense CR: 7 (17 AC: 10, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (21-32/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13 &amp; concentration: 0)  
Overall CR: 5 (maybe a bit lower because of the lack of spellslots from the first wave and dependence on keeping vampiric touch concentration up for the higher damage output)

Nezznar could put out 32 damage per round if he can keep concentration on vampiric touch, but damage falls pretty quickly without that (down to offensive CR 3). I'm not too worried about it being too easy because they'll have just survived the previous fight so they should be pretty haggard by this point.

So that leaves me with one CR 6 (maybe 7) and one CR 5ish encounter right after the other with very little downtime. Is this okay? Any advice? Am I going to kill my party with this or is it relatively balanced?

In my upcoming campaign the party is investigating the underground depths of a massive superstructure known as the Citadel. After grinding through a planned 5-floor-deep dungeon, they will end up triggering an eldritch seal on the Citadel that causes them to be transported into a different realm. There, they will meet an ancient warrior who essentially guards this primordial force of death, a mass of the souls of everything that has died in this world, keeping it trapped underground beneath the Citadel, and that their breaking of this seal will cause this primordial force of death to eventually break free and wreak havoc on the world (dun dun DUN!).

In short, they learn of a ritual where those who trigger this seal are able to get a shot at taking the power of this force of death for themselves if they manage to get their hands on sacred artifacts held by the previous adventurers who broke the seal. However, as punishment for breaking the seal, the party members are also branded by a curse that grants them immortality, at a cost. Every time they die, they resurrect after 1d8 + (number of deaths) hours. However, each time they come back they suffer a temporary stat penalty which can be cleared by taking a long rest, though with enough deaths these penalties become permanent, with the seventh and final death causing them to go permanently insane and die for good. 

I'm wondering if anyone's tried a mechanic like this in the past. My main worry might be restricting the players from playing new characters, or the difficulty of meshing in a new character in with the party if one of the cursed members dies for good. Any thoughts?

My only experience with rogues come from 3.5 since no one of my players have tried a rogue yet. But I've noticed that he is more focused in scouting, fighting nowadays than before.

(The Sun and the moon bound to the soul) 
Stats (Each) 
AC: 25 HP: 25; Resistant to all damage types Weight: 0.5
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make with these magic weapons. On a hit with these weapons, the target takes an extra 2d4 piercing damage and 2d4 elemental damage.(fire, ice) 

Soulbound 
These weapons are soulbound to you during a ritual cast by an other worldly being. To work; this ritual requires the sacrifice of two magic weapons and the owners soul. As a result the magical weapons are destroyed and the owners soul is scarred, reducing one of their stats by 1.
Once complete the weapon's binding will leave a bonding point (rune/mark), with no fixed point, on the character's body as proof of the ritual. The weapon will be made of soul stone after this point, consisting of any color, texture and shape the owner wishes. All magic imbued into the original weapon is carried over to the soul-bound form.
Any Soul-bound weapon can be summoned instantaneously, in hand, as a Reaction, at the will of the owner. The owner may disband the item and have it return instantaneously to the void or bonding point where it's rune/mark is left on the owner. The weapons may be any distance from the owner and still respond to their call. They must remain on the same plane as the owner or they will be returned to the bonding point. Soul-bound weapons can never damage their owner, if such an opportunity occurs the weapon returns to the bonding point.While you wield this weapon, you also have resistance to the relevant damage type.

Ravens flight 
While wielding one dagger, the user may throw the other as a bonus action, after which the user will instantly teleport to its location, catch it, and attack the nearest creature. If you hit with this attack, the dagger deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage. A flurry of raven feathers are left at the previous location.

Dragons Breath
You imbue yourself with the power to spew magical energy from your mouth twice a day(once fire once cold). Until the spell ends, you can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Scaling 
Because these weapons are bound to your soul they get more powerful as you do!

The only D&amp;D module experience I have had prior to this is from the starter set where I played a Fighter, so I don't have a lot of experience under me to know how to get the most of the material in front of me. To be frank, this isn't a plea to min-max my character per se, I am not looking to do the most damage or outshine my party..just be competent in the Curse of Strahd setting while not crippling my own character progression.

At the table we have a Paladin, Druid, Cleric who are confirmed, with me and another PC with TBA character sheets. I am heavily leaning towards a rogue but I haven't really figured out how best I can build my character to complement my teammates let alone if this class is viable in CoS. We are all starting at Lvl 1 and our books are limited to the PHB.

My current thinking was to:

* Take the stout-halfling for the +2 dex and +1 con (also get the trait lucky)

* Skills in: Stealth, sleight of hand, perception, deception,  

* Expertise in Stealth and Slight of Hand

* Background: Criminal

* Weapons &amp; armour: Rapier and leather armor 

* At lvl 3 and beyond : Take the Assassin archetype. No idea about feats and such (any advice would be appreciated)

I was reading some of the D&amp;D Beyond Encounters of the Week, and found one I rather liked; [A Tale Too Far] (https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/419-encounter-of-the-week-a-tale-too-far). Basically, an NPC ""holds the party prisoner until they entertain him"", and they get a reward for it.

I like this, and sort of want to use it as a possible option for an NPC encounter in my upcoming campaign. In my scenario, the party finds an archmage who used their magic to create a sauna, and is enjoying lounging around. They aren't too pleased to entertain visitors, and as an Neutral Evil Evoker, a certain fondness for watching people crumble to ash is present. Still, the party catches our master-evoker on a ""good day"", and they are given a chance to earn their safety. Play a song, do some tricks, whatever, just entertain their ""host"" (three successful DC 25 (expected level 13+) skill checks before three failed checks), and be allowed to leave, without getting incinerated.

The catch here is I assume that *just* getting their safety is sort of jerkish of me, so I think if they did well, said wizard should maybe actually REWARD them for their efforts. Here's where we come to my problem; I can't hink of anything. ;) 

If you were a powerful wizard fond of blowing things up, but your guests actually entertained you, what might you give them to praise their success, apart from their skins?

0,0,8,0,"My expectation for DnD was to make a character, finish a campaign, and play the character for the next one. For example, make a character and do a starter quest, end on lvl 5. Take the same party on a different campaign. End with 4 or 5 more levels. Or, if necessary, take your moderately leveled character to a different party and keep playing. By this expectation, you would play about 5 unique campaigns with your character before saying goodbye. That's a pretty solid career!

But my DM let slip in our last session that in our campaign (new party and characters) that our characters would end at lvl 20. I was shocked. Then I poked around on here and found that this was a common practice. So I have to wonder, are DnD characters one shots? Do you retire a character at lvl 20 just because they're capped? What if you want to keep playing them? But then if you move parties, would your new DM allow all your unique traits and items that makes your character special?

Makes me feel a bit trapped. Like a fever dream that just comes and goes like the wind. My current character has goals beyond completing the current campaign and I was hoping to see them come to fruition in a sequel campaign down the road.

0,0,7,5,"I've just created a level 1 artificer for a new game, and I've noticed that they're really, *really* dependent on their tools to use their class features. Specifically:

* Magical Tinkering: Requires thieves' tools or artisan tools.
* Spellcasting: Requires a focus. In particular, ""You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some  kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature."" This is stronger than the language requiring other spellcasters to have a focus if they want to avoid needing other material components: an artificer *needs* a focus for *all* spells, even ones that don't have a material component, and including cantrips. Also, ""After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.""
* Infuse Item: No tools required, but you need a target: ""Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.""
* Tool Expertise: Useless without tools.
* Arcane Armament: Requires a magic weapon.
* The Right Cantrip for the Job: Useless if you can't cast cantrips because you have no tools.
* Spell-Storing Item: Requires either a weapon or a spellcasting focus.
* Soul of Artifice: Relies on magic items.
* Alchemist:
   * Alchemical Homunculus: Requires alchemist's supplies to summon or revive.
   * Alchemical Mastery: Requires alchemist's supplies.
   * Chemical Savant: Resistance always works. *Greater restoration* requires alchemist's supplies.
* Artillerist: Note that you can now use rods, staffs and wands as spellcasting focuses.
   * Arcane Turret: Requires smith's tools.
   * Wand Prototype: Requires woodcarver's tools to imbue a wand.
   * Fortified Position: Enhances Arcane Turret.

Now, I actually think that this is a good thing. If any class is going to be in trouble without their equipment, it's the artificer. I think it's interesting that they're even worse off than a wizard if they get thrown in a dungeon without their stuff.

Anyway, this has some interesting tactical implications. Firstly, it removes one of my usual reasons for taking an attack cantrip, that being ""I want to be able to fight even if I lose all my stuff"". Very few attack cantrips have material components, the exceptions being Infestation, Thorn Whip and Word of Radiance. But as an artificer, I can't cast anything at all without my tools, and if I still have my tools, I probably still have my crossbow, so attack cantrips lose some of their utility there.

Secondly, it behooves an artificer to have some kind of recovery strategy for if they lose their gear. One approach is to make sure you choose an infusion that works on a common item, since infusions don't require tools, and an infused item can be used as a spellcasting focus. The obvious way is to choose Enhanced Weapon, which many artificers will do regardless. Then, if you lose everything, you can bootstrap your way back to spellcasting by finding or making a weapon - even if that means turning a tree branch into a club - and then taking a long rest, then imbuing the weapon and using it as a focus to prepare and cast your spells. That won't let you use Magical Tinkering or any of your specialty abilities, though.

Another approach is to be proficient with a tool kit that is easily obtainable. I recommend Cook's Utensils - you can find cooking supplies in the kitchen of the nastiest orc fortress or kobold warren, and they cost one whole gold piece in the marketplace. It won't be enough for your specialty abilities, but you'll get your spellcasting back immediately.

In theory, at high levels, you could get hold of a focus (cheap tools or an imbued weapon) and then use Fabricate to create whatever tools you want, as long as you have the right proficiency to make the tools. That's probably a better bet for the Artillerist, since smith's tools would be the proficiency to make most tool kits, including more smith's tools. I can't think of any other way to obtain tools magically *ex nihilo* \- Leomund's Secret Chest requires you to have the replica chest on hand. Maybe your GM will let you use the Many-Handed Pouch infusion to add a new pouch (looted from your goblin jailer) to an existing pouch network, in which you've stored the LSC replica chest, allowing you to summon your chest which contains backup tools and other emergency supplies, but I don't think that's quite RAW.

Anyway, I just think the tool aspect of the artificer is interesting, and makes for an entertaining and intriguing new approach to spellcasting and other class features. Any thoughts?",dndnext,What is an Artificier without his tools?

0,0,33,2,"I was going to bring this up in tonight session but first I wanted to double check with you guys since maybe I'm in the wrong here.
A little background first, our group consists of 6 people, 4 of them have previous DnD experience (however afaik it's the DMs first time, well, DMing). I don't but I have a background in RPing in MMOs, the latest being ESO with a system similar enough to DnD to compare the two. With that being said I'll jump right into it

A) Barely any IC action during combat  


What I mean by that is that player characters don't really talk during combat, like we don't come up with strats, don't communicate our next action so our allies can act with us on it. In ESO it felt a lot more dynamic with players interacting with each other, examples I remember from the top of my head would be;  

A1) In the middle of a bloody fight our Barbarian (obviously it wasn't called that in ESO but he was pretty much a textbook Barbarian) told me (a Spellblade Dark Elf - probably akin to Arcane Trickster/Hexblade) to back him up as he wanted to rush the head of the group we were fighting to put an end to it so I went with him expended my last few spells to clear a line for him and then hold off his allies while the Barbarian engaged in one to one combat.  

A2) Mages conjuring up a powerful spell and yelling at the party to get out of the way before unleashing it or 
putting a status debuff on an enemy and then yelling ""Go! Now!"" or something similar to indicate the priority target.



B) ""Bosses"" show clear signs of intellect but behave like video game bosses  


So far we're only 2 sessions in but what struck me as odd is that the Kobold Captain we fought never bothered to command his underlings. He made deragatory remarks towards our party so he was clearly intelligent yet seemed perfectly content to have his underlings spread out and die while just hitting the ""tank"" himself. Another example would be a conjured Manticore grinning at someone missing an attack but also falling into the pattern of just hitting the ""tank"" when there's much bigger threats in our party.  
This makes it feel a little underwhelming since our party set up is far from optimal; we have 2 sorcerers, one wizard, a fighter archer and a paladin who's the only melee. I feel like bosses should move around more and if they have allies should command them in a more efficient way to either punish us for our poor party set up and also for our complete lack of tacticts. 

With the points mentioned above combat feels a lot like we're just repeatedly rolling die until the thing is dead and should we ever lose a fight it's because we didn't roll the die well enough, not because we were poorly prepared or for a lack of strategy.  
It's also annoying because I don't get to flesh out my character during combat situations, which, considering it's DnD, are rather frequent so a pretty big part of the game.

With all that being said I'd like to point out that I'm not necessarily having a bad time, the RP outside of combat feels adequate and I like the people I'm playing with, I just feel like it could be a lot more lively at certain points.

0,0,35,43,"Fellow DMs of Reddit, I've been running TftYP for my friends as a sort of casual secondary game online.  The most recent adventure we just finished was White Plume Mountain...which they kind of breezed through, casually bypassing most of the major dangers.

The party was a tempest cleric, a lore bard, a shepherd druid, and a war wizard 6/fighter 2

First they took the left path. When they reached the super tetanus room, fearing floor traps the cleric used control water to raise the water level from the hallway above into the chamber.  He then dropped water walk on the party and they strolled right across.  When they found the floating river, the druid shifted into an octopus, went against the current, saw the waiting knights, and decided not to fuck with them. Finally when the reached the inverted ziggurat, the party threw out a couple shatters, left the room, and decided to let the monsters fight each other and come back in a few hours. On their way back through the tetanus room the water had receded, but there was still water filling the pits. One ritual water walk later and even though they slid across the hall they walked right across the pits.

Next they reached the middle path. When they reached the giant crab in the boiling bubble they 1) intentionally burst the bubble, 2) retreated through the doors, 3) let the crab boil, 4) cleric used control water to red sea the boiling lake, and 5) sent in the wizard (a fire ganasi) to loot the chest.

Finally they took the right path. After water walking over the hidden green slime they reached the glass orbs room. The cleric dropped spirit guardians and just maintained it for 10 minutes, killing all the monsters in the orbs. When they broke the orb with the talking ring, the instantly distrusted it and mage handed it out of the room with nobody putting it on. In the bit with the flesh golems they got the right answer, then proceeded to name their new companion Gregory.  

Then they reached the geysers and chains room.. Immediately forgoing trying to actually brave the chains and discs, they went back into the hallway as the wizard ritual cast floating disc. When that was done, they waited for both geysers to burst, loaded the golem and bard onto the disc, wizard used fly on himself, flew across the chamber, and lowered a rope to the 2 on the disc. Meanwhile the bard shrunk himself and took a ride on the wild shaped druid.

When they finally reached the vampire the tempest cleric, who entered the dungeon already worshiping sea gods, used wave to create a cube of force to keep the vampire out. They then spammed spells at the vampire while the flesh golem beat the vampire senseless. On a side note, why the fuck does a cr5 flesh golem have magical attacks but a cr 13 fucking vampire not?

**Note: This campaign will be in the world of Exandria from the Critical Role podcast, according to the Tal'Dorei campaign guide.**

Hello r/dndnext! I have DMed a few one-shots in my time, but I have had some grand plans and am now setting up my first long-term game, which will be happening over this summer, and hopefully future summers to come. One of my players has decided to be a Warlock, which is already fantastic. To make things better, he let me choose the subclass he would be playing (with his input as well). Here's the sparknotes of his backstory:

\- A Dragonborn found, abandoned, by a human/elf couple (the mother was human and in her mid to late thirties)

\- Mother was a priest of Erathis (the Lawbearer), so he worked as a priest as well

\- Eventually, he began clerical training under a childhood friend of his: Birel, a female elf

\- The High Priest had to interrupt their training to send her on a mission that she hasn't returned from

\- Upon asking about her, the High Priest simply tells him that the mission was confidential, and that he should pray for her return

\- He also essentially indefinitely put his training on hold, never assigning a new trainer to him

\- The PC is now in his 40s, and his mother has died of old age

\- The PC is going through a bit of a crisis, feeling as though his loved ones are all starting to disappear, and is angry at the Lawbearer and High Priest for their complacency

\- He decides to intensely research other avenues of power, specifically Celestial power

Long story short, he makes a pact with a being whom claims to be a Celestial; Loviana. Loviana *was* her name, at least. She is an Empyrean, a daughter of Erathis. However, she was influenced by the chaotic nature of Erathis' lover, Melora, and was also a more rebellious soul. She and Erathis had a falling-out and she fled from the Celestial plane she inhabited, instead choosing to wander the planes. She finally encountered the Abyss, and the plane that Tharzidun, the Chained Oblivion, had been sealed away in. She was slowly corrupted, changing her name to Sifrilana and becoming something close to the Forgotten Realms' Loviatar -  an intermediate goddess of punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, given the PC's current attitude, what would be some ways to mess with him via his patron? As far as he's convinced, he has made a pact with a Celestial who, after a decent Religion check, determined her to have a faint link with the Lawbearer. His real class is Hexblade, so I have pretty free reign as far as flavoring. 'Loviana' has spoken to him once, when he made the pact, and I intend their interactions to last and change up through level 20, if I can keep the game going as long. **In conclusion, what are some ways I can both challenge his PC, mess with his mind, and slowly reveal his patron's true nature?**

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses! You are all giving me great tips and ideas, as well as advice on dealing with this with my player. It’s all greatly appreciated!",dndnext,New DM here! Needing help with making my Warlock's patron actually scary.

0,0,8,10,"I remember hearing a podcast a few years ago by an experienced DM who described how he creates adventures using PC backstories. It was a great and inspiring podcast, and I can’t remember what it was called...

But, barring someone knowing the podcast I’m talking about, are there resources for this kind of adventure building?

What I am talking about is having the players write a backstory that includes goals and NPCs and how the player wants their story to develop (redemption, fall from grace, odyssey, rags to riches, rebirth, etc.). 

The DM then uses the backstories to build an adventure that incorporates all the PCs stories and ideas and some NPCs. 

For example, one player has a mentor that disappeared, last seen with a mysterious figure. They want to find the mentor. 

Another player has an old, close friend who made some bad choices and is in a nearby town probably being evil. They want to try to save the friend. 

Etc. 

The DM then works to find a way to tie these stories together (mentor was taken in by the old close friend, for example). 

This way everyone in the party feels they are following their PCs goals and stories. They are motivated by PCs own story. They’re not just going to check out the goblin caves in the nearby forest because that’s what adventurers do. 

Anyone know of resources about building this kind of campaign?",dndnext,Building an Adventure off PC backstories??
0,0,0,0,"It had been a long ride from Water Deep to the Dales. But it was necessary. Shortly after saving the children from the Piper, wanted posters had started appearing all over town; wanted posters that obviously described Cassandra. The only thing that didn’t match was the white dress; Cassandra never wore white.

It must be the changing Etna taking on Cassandra’s form so that she might more easily wreak havoc upon the land.  

The decision was made that she had to get out of town. So she, Two-Penny, Emmalite, and Percy, set out on the Great West Road to Dagger Falls. 

After nearly a month and a few bounty hunters later, they finally reached the Green Walls of Dagger Ford. The wanted posters had gradually decreased in frequency as the traveled until finally they hadn’t seen one in over a week. Time for a well-deserved rest. 

After a hot bath and hearty meal of fruits, vegetables, and a few too many potatoes (the Dalelanders were obsessed with potatoes), Cassandra was ready for her first night sleep in a bed in over a fortnight. 

She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. A deep, sweet repose full of dreams of music and sunlight, and better days. A perfect sleep. Until . . . 

Suddenly rough hands were pinning her down. An acrid smell, unwashed bodies, tobacco, cheap beer, filled the room. Cassandra was able to let out one shrill scream before a cloth covered her nose and mouth and the room started to spin. The last thing she remembered was being roughly shoved into a bag

She came to some time later, gagged, blindfolded, and bound. She could tell she was in a wagon moving fast. But not her wagon. Her wagon was home. It smelled of flowers and sunshine.  This wagon stank of rotten meat, stale clothes, and filth. 

After a few hours, the wagon stopped. She could hear men’s voices, rough and crude, an accent not unlike Two-Penny’s. 

“We’s gots to feed the bitch. If’n she dies ‘for Crumpet gets his prize, there’ll be hell to pay,” one of them was saying. 

“We’ll just take out the gag . . . she’ll swallow anything we put’s in her mouth!” the other replied. The both got a laugh out of that.

The gag was removed, “Here lady, You’s got a keep up yer strength. Have some of this fine salted pork,” A lump of cold pork was shoved into her mouth. 

“Stop it you!” she screamed, spitting it out, “I can’t eat meat!” Cassandra sobbed. 

“Fine. More there is fer us, then. At least have something to drink. Hold her mouth open, I’ll pour.” Strong, rough hands, took hold of her hair and chin and pried her mouth open. She could feel a bottle against her lips and a burning liquid poured into her throat. Then her mouth forced shut until she swallowed. The thugs repeated this several times, until the will to fight back drained out of Cassandra and she passed out drunk.

They spent at least two days on the road like this, until they arrived at what turned out to be a large town. After a time on cobbled streets, every bump a knife in her sore back, they stopped and she was lifted out of the wagon and carried into a building. The smell of cooking food told her she was in a kitchen. 

She was laid out on a table, like a sacrificial feast, held fast at the wrists and ankles. The sound of boots on flagstone striding into the room filled her with dread.

And then, an elegant but cold man’s voice, “Good work my lads. You’ll be handsomely rewarded for this. Now, let us have a look at my bride-to-be . . .”

The blindfold was removed, the gag taken out. “Ah, she is quite the beauty. My dear, you have the honor of soon becoming Lady Crumpet,” he looked her up and down. Spread out on the table like this, with that leer in his eye, it was surprising he didn’t lick his lips. “You are allowed to show your pleasure.”

Cassandra was barely able to speak, “Pleasure? I’d rather spit in your face, you loathsome troll!”

His response was immediate, a hard backhand across the face. “I like a bit of defiance in my women. But I’ll soon tire of that then you’ll have to be broken just as one of my horses.”

Turning to the thugs, “Give her to the maids to get cleaned up . . . the wedding is at dusk.”

The gag and blindfold were put back in place and a cloth again covered her nose. In just a few moments, Cassandra was unconscious. 

When she woke, she was strapped to a chair in front of a dressing table, a large mirror before her. She had been bathed, her hair had been braided and coiled on her head in the shape of cone with a white tassel crowning it. 

Her face had been powdered white, her checks rouged, her lips painted red. On most any other woman, this would have been beautiful. On Cassandra, it made a mockery of her wild, untamed splender. 

She was dressed in what some women would say was a beautiful white gown. To Cassandra, it was uglier and more constraining than the leather straps binding her to the chair. 

As her head cleared, she began to take in her surroundings. She was in an elaborate dressing room, pink and frilly. Silver and lace adorned every surface. 

And then, in the mirror, she saw Her . . . she saw the Witch. 

Most people wouldn’t have known she was a witch. But Cassandra knew. Her people knew witches . . . they were haunted by witches. 

To the casual observer, she was a tall, lithe, elegant lady with a lordly bearing and a sophisticated air about her. But Cassandra saw through it all. To Cassandra, she was an aged, withered hag. 

“Ah my dear. Within the hour, you shall become my daughter. I know you resist. And I know also that it is in vain. When my spell takes you, your will shall writhe and struggle and fight. But it will be of no use. Your body will do as it’s told. The more you fight it, the sweeter your surrender.”

Not many would have missed her laugh was the cackle of a witch. 

She leaned in and whispered words into Cassandra’s ear, words that could only be heard but never remembered. Words that melted on the memory as snowflakes in the palm of your hand.

“Smile, my pretty,” she said when the spell was complete, “your wedding day is upon you.”

Cassandra fought not to smile but it was useless. She beamed into the mirror the most beautiful of smiles as the Witch removed the straps that held her down. 

“Come my dear, go to the altar and marry my son. The honeymoon bed awaits.”

Cassandra rose and followed her to the door, still smiling, a single tear running down her cheek. 

As she reached the door, the wedding march started to play. 

As she approached the altar and lord Crumpet, five young women dressed in gaudy gowns, fell in step behind her. At the altar, he heard Crumpet, saying to the priest “Let us hurry this up, shall we? After this is consummated I have card game to get to.”

It was like a nightmare that she couldn’t wake up from. It was happening so fast. All hope was lost . . . there was no way out.

“Dearly beloved,” droned the priest, “We have gathered here this evening to witness the joining of this couple in wedlock.”

Cassandra’s eyes were pleading with the priest to stop but she knew it was to no avail. 

But then, as the priest continued, he looked at Cassandra with a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes and he winked. Then blew a kiss to someone in the audience. A glimmer of hope shot through Cassandra. 

“Does anyone here tonight, have cause why these two should not marry?” asked the priest of the crowd.

“What, other than he being a complete bastard? I can’t think of thing.” It came from the stage, from one of the musicians. 

Crumpet stammered and turned, obviously shocked that anyone would dare to do such a thing. When he saw who had dared, his eyes narrowed and he screamed “TWO-PENNY!!!”.

Jack “Two-Penny” Rasp stood defiantly on the stage, a broad and smug smile on his face. Handing his fiddle to one of the musicians, he jumped down to the ballroom floor.

“Two-Penny! I’ll have your hide for boots you scamp!” Crumpet was apoplectic, frothing at the mouth, eyes bulging.

If anything, Two-Penny’s smile got broader. “Doomsdale?” he called out and from the ample bodice of one of the bridesmaids’ gowns, pop went the weasel. Doomsdale was flurry of furry fury. A terror to behold. First, in one of the women’s hair, then climbing up the leg of another. Biting, growing, hissing. She sent the bridesmaids into a shrieking panic, blocking the path between Two-Penny and Crumpet. 

As Crumpet tried to force his way through them, Two-Penny called out again . . . “Oh children?” 

Four of the baker’s assistants, actually ruffian urchins hired by Two-Penny, knocked over the table holding the wedding cake. The cake wasn’t a normal cake. Magics cast by Emmalite had rotted it to the core. When it broke apart, a foul stench filled the room.

The children then rushed into the guests, molesting them heartily . . . grabbing at anything that looked valuable . . . rings, necklaces, silverware, gold teeth. The crowd went mad. 

One of the guests, a Halfling noble, leapt on to a table and yelled out “A Pestilence! A Plague! Run for your lives!”, and then turned towards Cassandra. The Halfling “noble” was none other than Percy Starkadder, the Scourge of Balder’s Gate. Percy gave Cassandra a smile and a thumbs up, before rushing after the crowd and locking the door behind them. He then bolted up the stairs to the balcony. 

A familiar voice was  whispering in Cassandra’s ear, “This way, dear. Let’s break that witch’s spell.” Cassandra turned, it was Etna, dressed in the vestments of a priest. She led Cassandra to the one remaining bridesmaid . . . Emmalite, the weasel bearer. 

Crumpet finally broke through the bridesmaids. Pointing his sword at Two-Penny he yelled “YOU!”.

Two-Penny smiled at him and replied mildly, “Who? Me? Crumpet, you great festering tit. Are you familiar with the term ‘Je Tuche’? Here, maybe this little song will help me explain…”

He then turned to the band, who was obviously in on the plan and said “What say you me lads? Play us a tune? Let us dance into battle, shall we?” 

At this, Two-Penny began beating out a cadence, striking sword to dagger as he stalked across the room. The band struck up a tune and Two-Penny began to sing:

""Je Tuche is old Elf for ‘I touch’""

""To a dumb fuck like you that don’t mean much""

""It means that I hit""

""You stupid git""

""It’s what I’ll say whenever I touch""

""Je Toche!""

On those final words, the air distorted and flowed from Two-Penny’s blade towards Crumpet. As the wave hit him, Crumpet recoiled in pain . . . Two-Penny’s spell had struck home.

As he reeled from the power of the spell, suddenly, Etna was upon him, a sword slash across the gut.

Emmalite took Cassandra by the arms, leaned forward and kissed her gently on the forehead. A shimmer, a spark, a very loud silence. And the spell was broken. Rage filled Cassandra’s eyes and Emmalite offered her a crossbow . . .

Two-Penny hadn’t missed a beat:

""It comes from the art of fencing""

""Where with swords not words we’d be mincing""

""So you’re shit out a luck""

""You stupid dumb fuck""

""‘Cause I’ve studied the art of fencing""

""Je Tuche!""

Again Crumpet fell back before Two-Penny’s spell. Before he could even begin to recover, two crossbow bolts drove into his chest. Cassandra smiled. Of her own accord this time.

Waving his sword wildly, trying to find space to recover, Crumpet backed against the tapestries covering the wall. Suddenly, a flaming arrow sank into the tapestry just above his head, setting it ablaze. The dry, ancient tapestry burst into flames, setting alight Crumpet’s cape. On the balcony, Percy let out a triumphant “High Ho!”, as he knocked a second arrow.

Screaming, Crumpet jumped forward to avoid the flames and right into Etna’s blade, she slashing his shoulder to the bone. In a flash, she was gone. 

Two-Penny jumped back on to the stage with the musicians, motioning for them to stop their tune. As they did:

""I prey to the gods who watch from on high""

""To please have mercy on this guy""

""Yes he’s real dumb""

""And he’s looking real glum""

""But the time has come for him to die . . .""

""Je Tuche!""

As the spell struck, blood began trickling out of Crumpet’s ears. But he stood defiant ready for the fight.

As another crossbow bolt buried itself in his groin, Cassandra’s golden laugh rang out through the hall as she began to reload.

Two-Penny leapt from the stage and charged forward towards Crumpet. Running his blade through his gut, he spun, flinging Crumpet off his sword and against the flaming wall. Before he could react, another of Percy’s arrows, struck him in the shoulder, followed quickly by a bolt from Cassandra’s crossbow.  By the time Crumpet had regained his footing, Two-Penny was across the room.

Staggering forward, Crumpet stumbled past the altar and turned to face Two-Penny and fell to his knees. Two-Penny’s smile was that of predator. “You might have bested me 15 years ago, you great spotty muldune, but I’ve learned a thing or two and you seem to have forgotten what little you knew. Say goodnight Crumpet . . .” and he started to charge . . . 

But, in a flash, there was a hooded figure, rushing from an alcove. A woman’s voice called out, “No! You can’t! You can’t kill him.”

The woman knelt beside Crumpet, and eased him to the floor with a loving touch. Cradling his head in her hands, she said “I won’t let you kill him . . .” Kissing him deeply, she plunged a dagger into his chest. Pulling back her hood, revealed a beautiful, older woman, beautiful red hair flowing like a river of sunlight. “That’s my job!”

Two-Penny stopped in mid stride, as if he’d been struck a mighty blow. “Siobhan . . .” his words were choked out just ahead of wail. “I had no idea you’d stayed with him.”

“My dear, sweet Rasputin. I had no choice. He said he’d kill you if I didn’t marry him. But Crumpet, that bastard, he got tired of me. And as I got older, just a few wrinkles, he tried to have me killed so he could marry her” she cried, pointing to Cassandra. “And he thought he’d succeeded, too. But I got away from the goons he’d sent to do the deed.” 

All this time,Percy had begun splashing lamp oil liberally around the room.

Two-Penny regained his composure and walked up to the dying man.

“It seems that years ago a die was cast . . .”

He rolled Crumpet’s writhing body over onto his stomach. 

“When I stole this sword, a spell was cast . . .”

He lifted Crumpet by the belt, hefting his buttocks into the air.

“But with on last hack, I’ll give it back . . .”

Thrusting the sword as he spoke the final words . . .

“Stuck right up your manky ass”

And Two-Penny let Crumpet fall. He turned to his friends, bowed deeply, and said in quiet voice “Je Toche.”

He turned to Siobhan, stroking her hair, looking deeply into her emerald eyes. “Bloody hell, you have gotten old. Fuck a bunch that. I’m out.” And he turned and strode towards the door. 

“Children…” he called out. And the urchins fell into line behind him. “What say you, we take our ill-gotten goods and drink ‘til we’ve gotten good and ill?” The urchins cheered. 

“Doomsdale . . .” and in a flash, his ""cat"" was sitting pretty on his shoulder. 

“And I can’t forget the band . . . gentlemen, I promised you 10 gold pounds. What would you say to 10 pounds o’ gold?” And he tossed them Crumpet’s purse. 

The band struck up a tune as they marched from the burning castle, Cassandra nibbling a carrot. ",dndnext,The Road to Argyll

Unfortunately, players and DMs alike tend to flake out at random times, so we prune regularly to remove inactive people. So we're all pretty active. Fun conversation and exciting revelry await for those who are interested. We're all from different time zones so people are always available around the clock. If this sounds like your kind of adventure, please click the link below. Please be communicative and serious players. I don't mind busy schedules, but at least give prior notice before leaving.

0,0,4,18,"Hi folks. I have recently been creating battle maps for all sorts of things, mainly my own campaigns, and I was being asked about what kind of encounters are in said maps, so I decided to write an encounter guide for one of them: Lost Temple of the Monkey King

Here’s a link download for the pdf guide (135mb): [Lost Temple of the Monkey King](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t6DMQf0Pi29oH3Itdz9PG7n0pFVKDewS/view)

 Link to compressed version for easy preview: [Lost Temple of the Monkey King C](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1epkwnGZ_Ar8eG2B-u1V_3IdYJIszeDlL) 

It’s basically 3 digital maps, and a 19-page guide to a series of puzzles, traps, tricks and encounters that you could use within your own games to fill the space I provide. It’s only a bunch of suggestions and by no means do you have to use it, in fact I suggest you take a look and tailor it to your own needs. The guide is aimed at ‘Tier 1 play’ but it does tier into 3 levels of difficulty by using my CIA system.

**The guide also contains a new ‘creature’ and 2 new magic items (that can be used as a set).**

You can find my original VTT maps here: [Maps](https://www.deviantart.com/zatnikotel/gallery/68760870/Temple-of-the-Monkey-King)

**Please note that all of my stuff is completely free** (I don’t do Patreon, marketplace etc.), and a way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 35 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible). This map is not available on other sites and therefore contains only images of my own creation.

0,0,12,0,"Hello, yesterday I posted in this same subreddit a request for advices in creating a wizard that fights using his sword ranged, and using it in order to deliver its spells ( this one  [https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b6hd77/flying\_sword\_wizard\_need\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b6hd77/flying_sword_wizard_need_help/) ).

I now did a homebrew school in order to do said thing, and I'm posting it here for advices in order to make it more balanced, nerfing its aspects that might be too strong or buffing it if too weak.

I admittedly took a few features from existing classes, mixing them in a way that i think is thematic to what I'm trying to do.

So, here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

**School of the Flying sword**

The School of the Flying sword is a magical tradition that allows wizards to effectively control weapons - traditionally swords - with their minds, making them fly and using them to attack enemies.

More martial-minded than wizards of other schools, wizards of this arcane tradition are frequently found on the battlefields, often in the role of commanders, using their superior intellect to control the flow of the battle while fighting with their swords at a distance relatively safe.

&amp;#x200B;

*Flying sword:*

When you select this school at 2nd level, you learn a 1-hour ritual that bonds you to a single, one-handed melee weapon of your choice. You must be touching the weapon for the time of the whole ritual.

Once you have bonded the weapon, you gain proficiency with it and you can contol it with your mind, giving it the power to fly.

It constantly, effortlessly hovers next to you as long as you wish; when taking an attack action you can command it to attack a target in the range of 30 feet. After the attack, the weapon immediatly returns to you.

When you use your bound weapon to attack (both in melee and ranged) you add your intelligence modifier to the attack roll, but not to damage. If using it ranged you add no modifier to damage at all, and if using it in melee you add your strength or dexterity modifier to damage, as appropriate.

When you cast a  cantrip or a spell with a range of touch or that requires a melee spell attack or a melee attack, you can instead use your bound weapon to deliver it as part of the same action, effectively giving it a range of 30 feet. When you use your bound weapon in this way, you can't add the weapon damage to the damage of the spell, unless the spell or cantrip requires an attack with a weapon. 

Starting from level 12 you can bond with 2 light melee weapons or 1 two-handed melee weapon. If bonding with 2 light weapons you can control both with the same action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Spellsword:*

Starting at level 6, whenever you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one attack (either ranged or melee) with your bound weapon as a bonus action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Greater spellsword:*

Starting at level 10, whenever you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one attack (either ranged or melee) with your bound weapon as a bonus action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Keen mind, keen sword:*

Starting at level 14, whenever you use your bound weapon to attack or deliver a spell you add your intelligence modifier to the damage. This additional damage is of the same type of the weapon used and it's multiplied in case of a critical hit.

In case you're bound to 2 light weapons, the additional damage is applied only once per attack, not once per weapon. If the 2 weapons deal different types of damage, you can choose the additional damage to be of either type.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is it. I'll be grateful to anyone giving any advice.

0,0,8,0,"A little bit of backstory, my Oath of Ancients Paladin had his sword (one of his most cared belonging together with his shield) cursed by a green hag into the equivalent of  a berserker axe. After almost killing the party wizard twice, we are now looking for a way to break the curse. The necessary mcguffin is in the hand of, who would have guessed, a full hag covenant.

Party engaged (quite poorly) the covenant, ended up killing one, capture one and the last one that was turned by me managed to escape, after hearing one of them screaming ""get the dragon"". Now, i decided to torture the evil granny to know a) what the hell does she means with ""get the dragon"" and b) where is the mcguffin, with full intention of killing her after she tells me what i want to know

My DM is saying I'm braking my oath possibly permanently, since torturing someone is against the ""be your own light"" part of my oath; my counter argument was that my character has a personal vendetta against hag and that well, she's an hag, she's unredeemable evil and leaving her alive would only make more harm to the world. The situation was also kinda iffy considering we could have a dragon on our asses 

So, after all this writing, do you think paladins should fall after breaking their oath, be temporarily stripped of their powers, or that Paladins are human being and sometimes they make mistakes that doesn't necessarily need a mechanical punishment?

Edit: for the record, i am not trying to argue with my dm and bitch untill he allows me to do whatever i please, of he wants to strip me of my power and put me on a quest to take them back so be it, it would be fun.

0,0,27,26,"I set up an outdoor 'dungeon' with some really weird encounter scenarios. Setup is a river flowing through a canyon (think the grand canyon) but with less room around the river/walkable areas.

&amp;#x200B;

The first one ended up being a really fun few minutes where the level 5 party very intelligently decides NOT to fight a zaratan and just let it do its thing. Quesion for yall- The paladin did cast BANE on it, since it had no 'harmful/noticable' affect I had the creature ignore it. Another PC swam along side it (30' away) and I had that ignored as well. That pc cast speak with animals, which I had not do anything since its a monstrosity, did I rule that correctly? In retrospect I think I should have let it work for RoC if nothing else.

&amp;#x200B;

Second one occurred when they tried to swim around a blockage of debris swept onto the trail from the river. The lizardfolk tied two players to himself and tried to swim them around, while 2 others tried to swim themselves and the last stayed on shore waiting for his turn on the 'taxi'

Obviously they now have to fight in the water... against a school of Quippers and 2 water elementals. This should be a DEADLY fight. (2 cr 5s plus the fish). Note I realized this was a little too hard so ignored the dmg resistance from teh MM.

The Sorceror instantly fireballs the school of quippers wiping them out, which makes her targeted by the elementals who like their fish pets! She goes unconscious fairly quickly but doesn't sink all the way to the bottom due to being tied to the wizard and the druid.

One elemental goes down fairly quickly after being concentrated on, and the other retreats after taking a ton of damage back down to the river bottom amid a large mass of seaweed.

THe paladin says... I Can hold my breath for 5 minutes IM GOING IN and dives down. Most of the rest of the group is fixated on getting the sorceror breathing again.

Unfortunately for the Paladin that mass of seaweed was a SEAWEED MONSTER (A Roper that was a PLANT and had Underwater Breathing). So he struggled for a bit before his friends realize he needed help. The Paladins OOC response- ***WTF its like NEMO and that thing he lives in!!!!!!!!!*** which is what I was going for so :P:P:P

Note during the fight I ruled anyone without a swim speed making an attack roll at disadvantage. Thoughts?

No PC deaths! Just 1 went unconscious :(

&amp;#x200B;

A bit later the path opens into a sinkhole the party needs to figure out how to scale the cliffface around ti (they are too scared to go into the water).

THe druid summons 2 giant chameleons and shifts into one. Everyone mounts up! The canyon has dense vegation growing across it somehow, blocked any view of the sky, so when the river splits into two the Chameleons grab vines and start crossing above the river to where they see a landing, light is dim so there's just some shadowy movement... they go for it!

Wizard casts GREASE on the landing hoping to trip up whatever is on it. Unfortunately the Barlgura makes its save after casting ENTANGLE on the party and leaps into the Vines giving off weird challenging HOOTs. INstantly the cleric of Pelor says... plants are flammable right? Me- Yup if you do enough dmg to em. Ok FIREBALL THAT FUCKER AND ALL TEH VINES HE's Hanging from.

The barlgura get's singed but makes his con save on the entangle and after falling 20' is able to grab the cliff behind him to not fall to the river below. He HOOT HOOTS angrily... and there is an answering HOOT HOOT from just out of sight range as another Barlgura ;Tarzans; his way in by violently swinging (i took their 'long jump' ability and applied it to swinging through vines to get into melee range quickly was a fun narrative). He immediately starts beating on the sorceror who firebolt cantrips the vines holding him but not enough to break the vine (i gave vines 10hp-she rolled way low for dmg)

The wizard is now panicking and says FUCK IT I""VE GOT A FIREBALL STILL and kabooms the second Barlgura who fails his save (because nothing was around I gave him Disadvantage on trying to find something to grab) and splashes into the river below after getting burned a bit.

Weird HOOTing is heard and splashing as the river carries it away. As they are debating whether or not to chase him down the river the HOOTs changed cadence and the Barlgura mysteriously disappeared. (these guys have Invis).They loot the Barlgura's cave and we end the night there.

0,0,36,27,"Context: My group meets weekly at a local game shop; some players live close by, some need to bus in. So usually we have a good chunk of the group (including me) getting there 30-45 minutes early to set up. One usually get's there close the the start time, and the last one is usually a little late (though sometimes by 30 minutes).

This hasn't been an issue group wise, as I'm blessed with a pretty nice and chill group. We usually just talk nerdy until everyone is present, then launch into RP Question/Recap. 

So while not a big deal, I have noticed 2 minor issues:

1. If a player is running particularly late, some tension starts forming as some players (and tbh myself) want to get going and then we start awkwardly debating getting started and just having him catch up.
2. The group sometimes gets particularly deep in a discussion, so even when the last player arrives and is good to go, it takes a bit of time before everyone settles into the game.

Mostly I'm just looking for anything I could do before the game to help keep my players and I preoccupied, something fun and maybe helps them get their mindset into the game?

0,0,46,0,"Howdy all, just looking for opinions on this.

So, RAW, critical ability checks just aren't a thing. A lot of people houserule that they are.

I like the idea of rewarding nat20s on ability checks, but I dislike the attitude that often accompanies allowing criticals on them, where players feel like a nat20 should just be an automatic success, regardless of their character's abilities and the context of the situation. Even if it doesn't lead to flat out arguing, it often leaves some ruffled feathers when a DM has to shut that down.

So here's my idea for players attempting the next-to-impossible.

When you roll a Nat20, you take 5 off the DC of the check. Thematically, some external force, magical or non, ""coincidentally"" helps in some way, shape, or form (a lucky break, so to speak).

DCs go as high as 40, to signify the absolute most implausible attempts. (At DC40, the check would drop to DC35, allowing only someone with at least +5 Prof, expertise, and +4-5 in the related stat to succeed.)

The real goal, however, is to have checks over DC25 to be outright impossible for a character with a negative modifier in that ability. (Since it doesn't seem to be clear, this would allow any character that *does* have *literally any talent* in that skill to pass this check on the 20. A lot of character's would pass not even on crits. But it would still let a character who isn't good at doing that roll if they really want to without the chance for their character to do something it shouldn't really be able to do, while allowing the characters that can to do so.)

How do you feel about this?

Edit: People don't seem to like it very much. I will be asking DMAcademy simply for ""Ways to make Nat20 ability checks exciting"", or something of the like.

Everyone is way too focused on me saying that this would make certain rolls impossible for a player, when that would generally mean it would make a roll that was otherwise impossible for 3/4 of the party to only be impossible for 1/2 the party instead, without allowing anyone and their grandmother to crit check success something.",dndnext,Nat20 Ability Check houserule

I thought of making a good-aligned Conquest paladin without breaking the tenets; by improving (changing) the concept.

**Douse the Flame of Hope**: even though my paladin is not made for redemption, I still like to give enemies their second chances (pretty much surrendering) by asking of their surrendering motives (but I think /u/Souperplex 's idea of using Zone of Truth is a more viable action; insight is good, too); because I think denying or breaking second chances are more regrettable than the first ones. So once they did deny or break them, the last thing they see is my warhammer in their faces.

**Rule with an Iron Fist**: I think of this as ""controlling"" your enemies (aside from casting command) through instilling fear on them; and by being frightened, your party can have advantage on battle, as others are minding their own business by cowering. Or it can be that you dominated or killed their leader and you used it as an example to them not to try to defy you.

**Strength Above All**: I was confused at first, but then I watched How To Train Your Dragon and heard Drago said ""So, he who controls the alpha, controls them all."" So, I thought overpowering the leader, or killing them, might not be so bad for the iron fist part. Controlling the leader by casting command (thinking about using it on battle to command their minions is confusing; one day they told them to kill, the next they told them to hug) is one thing; killing them is another thing, in which you can actually douse their flames out.

In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.

&amp;#x200B;

The ability seems fairly straightforward when looking at beasts, but when changing into humanoids little is explained. The description states that class features aren't gained from the new form but doesn't clarify what class features are. In the Monster Manual spellcasting is called out as ""the Spellcasting class feature"" making a fairly solid case to remove spellcasting from any humanoid stat block and I'd be inclined to remove anything that shares a name with a class ability like cunning action and sneak attack, but beyond that I'm lost.

&amp;#x200B;

A bear has proficiency in perception because of it's physical form but a spy's proficiency in deception is a learned skill. Would you treat these the same?

&amp;#x200B;

Would multiattck be considered a class feature due to it's similarities to extra attack?

&amp;#x200B;

Is gear part of a humanoid? Because you're a Knight does that mean you now have plate and a greatsword?

&amp;#x200B;

Would something like a lycanthrope or a deep scion even be considered humanoid for the sake of this ability?

So we are playing Mines of Phandelver and they are currently inside Cragmaw Castle. They entered the castle using the side door without alerting anyone and entered area 12 from area 11. Inside they found 2 hobgoblins and combat errupted. Since players retreated instead of trying to deal with them quickly and the way to the kings room was blocked by the players, the hobgoblins ran to warn the others of the intruders. I gave the players 4 rounds to prepare and they blocked some doors they hadn't explore yet and prepared for battle against almost all forced of the castle.

&amp;#x200B;

So the Druid in bear shape protected the upper side of area 12 and the rest were in the room with the beds. As they were fighting they start to hear something trying to open the door from area 14 (the kings room they blocked with some furniture) because of all the noise from the fighting. As the fight drags on, the druid looses all HP from the bear and retreats to where the other players are and the hobgoblins finally open the door to the king.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, there is only 3 hobgoblins alive and 1 goblin, the king and it's pet and the doppleganger. At this point they hear the King tell them to surrender or the dwarfs dies. The players abide and are escorted into area 14 and asked to surrender their weapons or  Gundren Rockseeker dies. After some negociating they decide to drop their weapons and the seassion ends.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think the next reasonable thing for the king to do? One thing I'm thinking of doing is put some shackles on them and have droop come help them (yea they have been with droop all this time but he was too afraid to enter the castle) since they have been very good to him, but any ideas are welcome !! 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a little background of one of the reasons they decided to drop weapons. In session 0 I asked players to tell me a story  of how they met  Gundren Rockseeker and 2-3 little storied of how the dwarf helped them. This was to create some connections with the players and the dwarf.

0,0,15,5,"Hi everyone! 

I've been DMing for a few years now and my current campaign for nearly a year. I'm really happy with how it's going and everyone is having fun, but I think not as much as they could be. In my experience I've had very few players that do much of any role playing outside of what is required, such as talking to guards when needed. I'm not sure if it's my players or my DM style but we mostly have combat, then a bit of RP or exploring required to get to the next combat. But my players never talk about their characters lives or ambitions or anything with the other players or NPCs.

It's not like I don't give them the chance, just the other day they had about a week of down time and I asked everyone what their character wanted to do for the next few days and you could have heard a pin drop. Another time, the party was performing a raise dead ritual on a party member (I have some house rules for this where players can contribute to the ritual making it more likely to work properly if they do something meaningful to convince the dead characters soul to return). Problem is, nobody talks about their characters story or personality, so besides what that character can do in combat, they knew almost nothing about his life even though they've been traveling together for a while. 

So what I want advice on is how do you encourage players to roleplay or how do you design roleplay based encounters? I don't mean speaking in character all the time, but just talking about or as their character with other characters in game in a natural way? ",dndnext,WANTED: DM advice on encouraging roll playing

0,0,18,2,"My party is currently at level 5 and I'm trying to plan my next level to help mend some rough edges in our group. 3 of the players, including myself, were new to D&amp;D (when we started at level 1), and this is everyone's first go at 5th Edition.

Currently we have 6 party members, but I'm not sure if our Wizard is just joining us for this particular adventure of the **Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan**, or if he's here to stay.

&amp;nbsp;

The Party consists of:

**My Lore Bard** who is mainly full support, and as a characteristic would rather persuade people with his charm, instead of deceit or intimidate them.

Cantrips: *Vicious Mockery*, *Mage Hand*, *Minor Illusion*

1st lvl Spells: *Healing Word*, *Faerie Fire*, *Dissonant Whispers*, *Bane*, and *Thunderwave* (in case enemies get close)

2nd lvl spells: *Heat Metal*, *Shatter*

3rd lvl Spell: *Hypnotic Pattern*

&amp;nbsp;


**Moon Druid**: Who sometimes plays tank, and other times plays support. Also has *Healing Word* and *Healing Spirit* (might only be allowed during combat or can target one person outside of combat).

**Champion Fighter** Who has been really bad at rolling, and has only done her critical 3 or 4 times at most.

**Hunter Ranger** Who has *Two-Weapon Fighting* and *Colosus Slayer*. Also has *Cure Wounds* to heal, and *Ensnaring Strike* for crowd control suport, when needed. But is also notoriously bad roller.

**Assasin Rogue** Who tends to be our main damage dealer due to bad rolls from other players.

**Wizard** Which is still unknown if he will stick around after this dungeon.


&amp;nbsp;


My problem comes with the upcoming *Additional Magical Secrets* and what to pick with it.

For my character I think that I've narrowed it down to 3 spells, which are:

**Bless**, to further aid my teammates. It will also help me to amplify multiple allies instead of just one, since I've been using most of my *Bardic Inspiration* on the Ranger and Fighter, to make up for their bad rolls.

**Spiritual Weapon** Which will allow me to attack as a bonus action in those times when my *Concentration* is already being used and there is no need to use or have run out of Bardic Inspiration. Currently I have *Thunderwave*, *Vicious Mockery*, and *Shatter* as my only spells that don't require concentration or a bonus action.

**Counterspell** I've heard people talk about it a lot, and how the Lore Bard is the best counter-speller of all classes, and it's one of those spells that you probably will rarely use, but you'll be glad that you have, when you do.


&amp;nbsp;


I mainly use *Bardic Inspiration* rather than *Cutting Words*, because my DM seems to look down on *Cutting Words* and still isn't quite clear on the times that I can use it. I don't argue it, and besides, *Bardic Inspiration* seems more of my character's trait than *Cutting Words*, and has proven to be a lot more useful on my allies.

Although he does play musical instruments, my character is less of a typical bard, but more of a devoted scholar and explorer with a lot of charm (Think Jean-Luc Picard mixed with Indiana Jones). He has become a master of words, and through his studies has learned to weave and manipulate sound waves in a manner that can alter emotions or even bend light. As a player (not as my character), I even bring a small leather bound looking journal and am the one that is always taking down notes and drawing doodles of our adventures, for the party and seemingly stuck to my book. I'm hoping that by the end of our game, which will be a little past lvl 10, I will have filled the journal with notes and doodles for the players to be able to see.",dndnext,Need some help with lvl 6 Support Lore Bard

My first pg was a dwarf paladin, didn't really know how to play so he died pretty quickly. Now with some more experience with me i'm trying to create a new pg, and i have to try the barbarian class. I'm not really sure about the race though. with the d6 i rolled i got pretty high stats, and by adjusting them (my DM lets us get a -2 in a stat to get a +1 in another stat) i have to chose between:

* HALF-ORC: STR 20; DEX 15; COST 20; INT 10; WIS 15; CHA13
* HUMAN: STR 20; DEX 16; COST 20; INT 11; WIS 14; CHA 14

If i look at stats only i think human is the right choice, i will have 18 AC (Half orc 17AC) with same HP (17), +3 initiative (+2 half-orc). 

If i look at proficiencies and abilities i lose so much by switching to human that i don't know if it's worth it (i would lose proficiency in INTIMIDATION, Relentless endurance, Savage Attack)

I wanted adventures, articles, monsters, traps and a whole grab bag of fun stuff. And I wanted something physical, but also something that I'd enjoy even if I didn't end up running the adventure. I've found it in the monthly ""Comic Book"" [Rolled &amp; Told](https://www.rolledandtold.com/). It can be bought or ordered from most friendly neighborhood comic shops.

&amp;#x200B;

It's so perfect and I haven't seen anyone talking about it on reddit so I wanted to advocate for it. If you scroll down to the bottom of this post I've attached an album of photos from the two books I just picked up.

&amp;#x200B;

The book is monthly and each contains a big adventure. I've read two of them and they're exactly the kind of adventure I'm looking for. I'm pretty particular, and I like lots of roleplay but also lots of mechanics and the kind of fun stuff that I'm too lazy to build myself like maps and complex traps/dungeons. The stories are unique and super fun.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a lot of other stuff in the book, which you'll see in the attached album. Beautiful art and maps. A few pages of comic spread throughout that is based on the included adventures or articles. There are articles about homebrew, or DM advice. Roll tables, Monsters, NPCs. And a mini adventure that isn't as big as the Main adventure at the beginning of the book. Plus it seems like there are other things that can be included. One of my books contains a super cool custom character sheet with a crystal ball and all sorts of interesting imagery.

0,0,8,6,"Love the new Artificer. So many good things to say about it. After several games and looking at many 1-20 builds, I had a few thoughts on what I'd do to improve it. I'd be curious to hear from others too.

I'll stick to what I want to see most; for the spell-storing to be a bit more of a core mechanic. Something that is present from lower-mid levels to the very end. Here's how I'd do it:

# 1) Move Spell-storing to lvl 7 but only allow it for lvl 1 spells

**Reasoning:** Levels 7-11 are fairly slow. Magic weapons, wands, and potions of health are starting to become fairly easy to come by, so the benefit you bring to the group by offering access to those things is waning. In combat, you've either been running arcane weapon since lvl 1 OR using cantrips and a few spells (on very limited slots).

# 2) Add 'Improved Spell-storing' at lvl 11 to allow lvl 2 spells

**Reasoning:** This was a cool ability. Very defining, very versatile. But it doesn't seem to me to stack up with what other classes can do at lvl 18. I also wouldn't want to wait until the game is almost over to get to try it out with all the fun lvl 2 spells (enlarge, levitate, etc). Lvl 11 feels right to me.

# 3) Add a 'Master Work' sub-class ability at lvl 18.

**Reasoning:** I see the Artificer as a half-caster that leans more towards the casting-side of things (while paladins and rangers, lean more towards the martial side of things). By level 18, your paladins are smiting for numbers that make your head hurt and giving there auras to everyone in 30'. Your casters are dropping 9th level spells. And rangers... erm... well... nevermind them.

At this level, it's ok for classes to occasionally break the game a bit.

My idea is to give the Alchemist something similar to magical secrets. It has a few limitations though; (1) you can only have one spell, (2) it has to be of a certain school of magic depending on your subclass, and (3) it has to be an 8th level spell or lower.

0,0,22,0,"I’m thinking about running a new campaign and I really love to basically traumatize my PC’s at the start to really set the intensity level of the campaign. I have a brutal idea - could I get some feedback about it?
(Gore-related descriptions ahead)

Prerequisites to know:
1. The PC’s don’t know each other yet.
2. Players may die at the beginning, though it isn’t designed for them to.
3. This will take place in a homebrew world.
4. Scenario CR may be Hard to Deadly.

So, I start with some ominous, ambient music, wait a moment, then say “[PC Name], [PC Name], PC Name]... I want you all to make a DC 14 Constitution Saving Throw.”

Upon a success, PC’s resist a paralyzing/sleeping poison they were subjected to and wake up to one of their legs or arms in the process of being sawed off (narrative describing the sound and their vision fades in and they regain feeling) on a wooden table by a cult member while they are tied down by rope. There are other tables with the other party members on them, who are all in the process of being sawed into.

Those who don’t wake might lose a limb if the ones that did wake can’t untie/break themselves free and save the others. Though each sleeping PC makes a waking Con Save for every limb the cultists get to (a chance to save each limb).

If they all wake, great! They can fight a bunch of cultists and try to escape. Otherwise, their body parts are going to be used to resurrect and piece together some sort of ancient fiend/devil-like necrotic entity (evil, previously dead deity maybe?). If they lose a limb, they have to make another constitution saving throw to not pass out. If everyone passes out, they’ll wake again later without the 1 limb and will be in separate wooden cages in a room together. Awaiting the next round/next part of the ritual (lest they escape their cages).

If they end up fighting and losing to the cult members, I’ll have the cult stabilize them and put them in the cages again. Perhaps poisoned with paralysis/sleep poison again, requiring more Constitution saves or Strength rolls if they don’t completely resist the poison (partial paralysis). Maybe I’ll add levels of exhaustion as they lose each limb/pass out.

I’ll have a series of pass out&gt;Constitution Save&gt;wake up and cult progress scenarios in case they end up not being able to escape repeatedly. If this happens enough (by possibly semi-rare chance) then eventually they won’t have any limbs, but will still be alive (the cult wants them alive for the ritual).

Also, if they escape without killing, destroying or completely foiling the plans of the cult then I’ll have the cult end up resurrecting their Fiendish entity (later on using other people’s bodies perhaps) and have that play out later in the campaign.

As you can tell, I really prefer the hard intro. Though for this, I’ll let them know that they might all die at the very beginning or become permanently debilitated, though won’t give them any details or hints as to what awaits them. I plan to allow ways for them to compensate for their potential limb loss going forward (ex. Magic legs, peglegs, etc.,). Though I won’t make it obvious or immediate. I’ll just know what options they have at their current levels if they pursue and inquire about them in-game.

- What thoughts, ideas and feedback do you guys have on pursuing this intro?
- What do you think about running this for newcomers vs experienced players?

**EDIT**: Perhaps there’s a lack in my description of this idea, though as railroaded as it sounds, I do plan to provide plenty of agency being available for the player, and will be heavily role play dependent as to the outcome.

**EDIT**: As it seems there are a lot of people absolutely opposed to the possibility of being dismembered, I ask this. If the possibility of not only prosthetics was available, but upgradeable, weaponizable and eventually (level dependent) magic enhanced prosthetic armaments were available to compensate for such a loss, how would you guys feel about that in this scenario?**

**EDIT**: Perhaps I’ll do One-Shots with each person individually before this session with their characters, and I could have them battle a higher level cultist at the end of their One-Shot as they are leaving. Fast forward to the start of the aforementioned intro, and everyone has been captured, tied and is about to be cut up into bits.",dndnext,Feedback on “The Brutal Beginning” for a New Campaign
0,0,130,36,"I really want to do a boastful, flamboyant braggard-type caster-fighter who is actually pretty good at fighting, and the Swords Bard with their high Charisma and melee skills kinda pops out.

But their biggest weakness, IMO,  is their absolute lack of self-buff combat spells. Haste, Shadow Blade, Enlarge/Reduce, Shield, Absorb Elements, Mirror Image, Blur, Magic Weapon and the like are all absent from their spell list. Greater Invibility seems like their first real self-buff and that comes in at level 7.

My first thought is that a level of Hexblade helps in getting shield proficiency, Armor of Agathys and Shield as well as all the usual Hexblade goodies including SCAG cantrips.

But of course, Blade Flourishes are incompatible with SCAG cantrips, otherwise Booming Blade and Mobile Flourish would actually be useful.

I’m thinking that Glamour might actually be better as a melee gish.

Glamour could get that Hexblade dip for Booming Blade, then go BB-&gt;bonus action Command: Flee, then use Warcaster to get another bonus action BB in. This would net (2d8+4+2d8)*2 = 44 avg damage without spending any resources and taking an enemy out of the fight for a turn.

This version would probably be concentrating on Bane.

The PAM Swords Bard/Hexblade could do 2d6+10+1d4+5 = 24,5 avg damage. Using flourishes could boost that by 13,5 but that’s it before the next short rest. I don’t know what spell they’d be concentrating on, maybe Hex? That would close the damage gap. That leaves them without Armor of Agathys though.

You could also go Whispers Bard with CBE and do 2d6+6+6d6=34 avg damage and use only two inspiration dice.

I know, they’re supposed to be caster first, melee fighter distant second, but I just wish they were, you know, even kinda good at melee.

Edit: I’m more trying to get suggestions on how to play and build Swords Bard as a gish rather than bashing the Bard as a class.

0,0,51,1,"It's a contentious houserule, to be certain. And I see it crop up often whenever people are talking about games they've been in. For those unaware, Critical Success and Critical Failures are the rules that a 1 is an auto-fail with usually extra bad consequences, and a 20 is a auto-success with usually extraordinarily good consequences.

I myself feel that these rules themselves are not bad. In fact I believe they give a bit of extra depth to the system. A bad guy, no matter how powerful, has the potential to miss the party or fail their impossible to fail save. While the good guys always have a shot, even a slim one, to land a hit on an enemy no matter how impossible. This itself means that players are always encouraged to try. Players are encouraged to not give up, and just quit the encounter. And those moments when a last ditch effort pays off is usually extremely memorable. Additionally, they can add a lot of fun into an rping event, especially in social circumstances. The bard trying to swoon some ladies in a tavern and rolling a natural 1 is amusing and usually worth a good laugh in the night. Which imo, is one of the most important elements in a collaborative-story-based-game like this, to have people have fun.

However, the flip side with this is that there are no established 5th edition tables for fails. Many of the charts in circulation right now are ones that are ones adopted by older editions, where the DM was encouraged to combat the players more often, and with a greater voracity. This means the Critical Fumble Tables used are moreso based on older mechanics, and do not have easy solutions in this edition. 

But more important than this, is I think people take Critical Success and Critical Failure, and give them far too much weight in how they impact a story. Getting a 20 and hitting an enemy, and describing it as a lucky strike that by the sheer grace of the gods, hits at the monster dead center of its blind spot, is fine. Getting a 20 in a skill check and describing how the PC seems to show an almost supernatural knack for this thing, is also fine. Likewise describing how a Natural 1 hits the monster, but at a bad angle and thus bounces off the monster tough hide. Or a natural 1 in which a person trying to woe a suitor ends up with a glass of water splashed in their face, are all fine.

Because the consequences aren't that big. Many dm's tend to make the effects of a critical success or failure too big. An enemy critically fumbling auto-kills one of its allies, dramatically shifting the fight. Likewise a player who rolls a nat 1 can drop their weapon at best, making them waste a round picking it back up. Or to some highly debilitating injuries such as Losing a Limb, dropping to 0 hp, killing a comrade, etc. Some people even turn Critical Successes into failures for fun, like a person getting a Natural 20 stealth roll ""Can't find their own character lul"". While okay in a situation where there isn't danger of characters dying, some Dm's do this kind of thing in very serious, life or death scenarios, and it really detriments the games and the players enjoyment.

I've been working on an original campaign setting book, and would greatly appreciate your feedback. I'm looking to accomplish 3 things:

1. Provide an incredible amount of resources and ideas to help someone bridge the gap between Adventure Module DM and Homebrew DM (Maps, tables, story hooks, factions, NPC's, etc.)
2. Share my diverse setting which incorporates a large variety of themes and play styles (trad fantasy, low magic, high magic, urban, military, steampunk, gothic, etc.), complete with a framework and general tips on how to bounce between them to keep the campaign fresh and increase player agency
3. Create a solid, high value product that people genuinely enjoy and helps them on their D&amp;D journey. Will be launching a kickstarter at some point, with flex goals including additional adventure modules, minis, dungeon tiles, and who knows what else lol

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your thoughts and feedback! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is this something you would buy? What would you like to see in a resource like this that would make it a worthwhile addition?
2. Art will be cruical to this project, what would draw you in more: A consistent style throughout or a different artist/approach to each province? Would commissioning more recognized fantasy artists in the community ie. Bob Kehl or taking a more crowd-sourced community submission process be more appealing to you?
3. What kickstarter flex goals or ideas would you like to see?

The party is 6 level 14s - Light Cleric, Swords Bard, Ancestral Barbarian, Rogue, Fighter, and Wizard.  They haven't rested in a while and are pretty low on spell slots, but I don't know their exact numbers.

The Cleric succeeded on a Divine intervention and temporarily became the avatar of his god, with the following effects:

**Avatar Benefits:**

-Fully recovered HP and spell slots

-Proficiency bonus goes to 6

-20th level caster with full spell slot schedule

-can casts spells at 3rd level and below without expending spell slots

-no limit on uses of Warding Flare or Channel Divinity

-can ignore all material components of spells

-have every spell on the cleric list prepared

-gain a 60 ft fly speed

-gain 50 temporary HP when the effect starts

**Downsides:**

-every 60 seconds and when the effect starts, gain 1 level of hollowing (homebrew rule, means he dies at the 2 minute mark if it's not over by then)

-after avatar state ends, DC 20 Con save against 5 levels of exhaustion (3 on a success)

The Cleric is about to fight the BBEG, a 20th level wizard with pretty standard wizard spells.  The BBEG also has 3 legendary actions to use on: Cantrip, Melee Attack, Spell (Costs 2), and Teleport (60ft).  He has lair actions that the Cleric doesn't know about, and hes a 60ft fly speed.

In order for your party to gain surprise on a group of enemies, all of your party members must remain undetected (usually by stealth) up to the point where you initiate combat. If any party member is detected before you attack, surprise is lost. [At least that's my impression from the last point of this sage advice.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/05/17/suppose-i-hide-in-combat-and-im-not-found/).

And as a ranged battlemaster fighter, it's worked splendidly. I didn't know how much damage I *wasn't doing* in my other characters until I played this fighter. And don't get me wrong, I love being awesome in combat. But, out of combat, there's just not much I can do.

In our current game, I've recently founded an adventuring guild after a few heroic quests accompanied by my party. We're the founding members, and years later, our little guild has grown. Before I made this character, I purposefully dumped a lot of points into CHA and took persuasion as a skill because I wanted to be a leader of sorts. It's been nice, but I just feel like I'm missing something roleplay-wise.

So I took a look at the bard. I've never played in 5E before, and I have to say, the features and spells all look a lot of fun. Bardic inspiration fits my leader role perfectly and gives me something to do with bonus actions, illusion cantrips help me give off resounding speeches and tell harrowing tales, buff and debuff spells both look like a lot of fun and can be pretty helpful during combat.

We're about to hit Level 6, and at that point, I was originally just gonna go fighter again--maxing about my dex, which as a human fighter with sharpshooter would be ideal. But I feel like this is the high point of a fighter, the next big advantage really doesn't happen till 11, which is a looong way off. On the other hand, if I start taking bard, I'll still be a beast in combat and have some support features and a ton of out-of-combat roleplay to boot.

Thoughts?

TL;DR: Level 5 fighter/guild leader with high CHA thinking of going bard for a few levels for fun and flavor.

Edit: Thanks guys! I've found some pretty good ideas ranging from magic initiate to dips in other classes to paying for skill training (which I'm definitely gonna ask my DM about). I appreciate the advice.",dndnext,Getting bored as a fighter. Thinking of going Bard next level purely for roleplay.

Proteusus

Transfiguration cantrip.

Requirements: S, M (1 gold piece if using the secondary function)

Cast Time: 1 Action

Duration: 1 minute

You may add decorative detail to a crafted item, carving runes, images, symbols, or crests into the item. The item must be no larger than a 5 foot cube, and the relief is only deep enough for the carved image to be visible. The carvings are permanent unless the Mending Cantrip is used on them to remove them.

In addition, you may spend one action using 1 Gold piece worth of materials to make a small mechanical device that you choose from the options below. The device is non-magical, though magic does power it, and ceases function after one minute. If the device’s function is not used before the duration ends, it loses its function and becomes mundane. 
•	Clockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or Soldier. This Toy can move 5 ft. on your turn for 1d4 rounds, moving in a random direction. Afterwards, it becomes inanimate, but maintains its shape.

•	Fire Starter: The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a Candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

•	Music Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end, when it is closed, or when the duration has completed.

•	Scribing Quill: This small quill automatically transcribes your words onto a piece of parchment, needing no ink or hand to control it. It knows the languages you know, and can only hear the voice of its creator. If the quill runs out of space to write on a piece of parchment, it stands still and no longer takes dictation until another piece of parchment is provided.

•	Sketching Quill: This small quill, over the course of one minute, can transcribe a small image in black ink onto a piece of parchment, needing no ink or hand to control it. The quill will start to sketch a scene the caster can see, so long as the caster continues looking at the scene, as if you were concentrating on a spell. The quill can only sketch a still scene, and cannot sketch a creature or object in motion. If the image is too large for the piece of parchment, the quill will fill in as much of the parchment as possible before standing still, and will no longer sketch until more parchment is provided.

In my opinion it is with favored enemy, natural explorer and primeval awareness. The changes that I have made are pretty simple and my players who have played ranger enjoy the changes.

**Favored enemy:** The changes are that the player doesn't pick an enemy or enemies but they learn from what they encounter and add it to there list. If you encounter a creature type 5 times you can add it to the list of your favored enemies. That is 5 different encounters. Not if you fight 5 orcs in one combat encounter. When you do so 10 times you learn enough of the language to understand it but not speak. At 15 times you can speak it.

**Natural explore:**  The features apply to all natural environments. Do not have to pick.

**Primeval Awareness:** Can be used a number of times equal to there wisdom modifier. I removed celestials,  fey, fiends, and undead. That is paladin territory. But added monstrosities and beats.

First off, hoping none of the people from my group wil be reading this, if so, /shoo.

Last week I did my very first oneshot (We Be Goblins) as DM for a part of my D&amp;D group. This saturday, I will be doing my second oneshot, this time I am writing my own oneshot after feedback given since the last session. The feedback consisted, among others, of one or more members feeling like they didn't have enough options to choose their own path.

So now, I decided to basically have them pick one of 3 quests and let them have at it.

When asking for input what the players would like to encounter, they answered GIANTS. Fair enough, lets toss some giants into it.

The party consists of 6 lvl 5 PCs; Paladin, Blood Hunter, Moondruid, Bearbarian (Moondruid 2/Ancestral Guardian Barbarian 3), Drunken Master Monk and Lore Bard.

&amp;#x200B;

Now however, I am running out of inspiration as to what mobs they are to encounter.

The premise of the quest: They are asked by one of the teachers from the Mages College to find 3 missing students. The 3 Goliath students ran off with an artifact from the Mages College and went back to their town. The town is an ancient ruin on top of a long abandoned mine and consists of various outcasts from other Giant-clans/herds (Ogre, Ogrillon, Hill Giants and Goliaths). They live somewhat isolated from the other races as the perception of Giantkin is not too favourable (racism because giants are stupid and violent, the usual).

The mine beneath the town is abandoned for about 30 years after the Duergar that resided there delved too deep and awakened something. Now I can find plenty of cave dwelling, underdark lurking, not-too-keen-on-sunlight type of monsters to fill such a mine, but I want to give the party some giants to fight as well. Problem is, I am having difficulties finding giants that might live there that can provide a challenge for the 6 lvl5 partymembers without resorting to the Hill Giant/Ogre/Ogrillon.

I am basically running a modified version of ""Out of the Abyss"". It has been a lot of fun because the party has very little knowledge of the UD. They are murder hobos' which works well in the UD because most of the monsters and NPC's want to kill them. 

The party is currently in Gracklstugh and has decided to join an attempted coup to overthrow the Mad King. The party has an assassin that is dead set on killing the King.

My main question is how should I handle the party's encounter with the King's Stone guard? 

The duegars will be invisible and will be around 50 of them. Seems like an easy TPK especially if you add the King. My thought is too add some of their duergar allies in the battle but that is where I am at a loss.

How do I incorporate Mass combat and traditional small scale Pc v NPC combat? 

 I want to create the sense of battles throughout the streets and an overall sense of all out war. I feel somewhat comfortable with the mass combat mechanics and plan on using duergar messengers/runners to keep the party in the loop of the ongoing battle as they proceed thru the city.

Also, last session the only dwarven PC sucker punched one of their duergar allies during an argument. The duergar let it go at the time but he is planning to kill the PC if the opportunity arises during the upcoming battle. Duergars hold grudges and hate surface dwarves so it is completely justified. My concern is the PC will think I am singling him out.  
Maybe he is knocked unconscious and taking as a prisoner to be used as leverage if the party turns on their duergar allies?  

Hopefully this makes some sense and appreciate any advice.",dndnext,Assault on a Keep

So I'm fairly new to D&amp;D and had been thinking about creating a homebrew Samurai class before noticing there was a Samurai Fighter archetype in XGtE. It mentions that the intention for this archetype was to recreate the cinematic feel as closely as possible while remaining within the perimeters of the game world. Upon reading through the features, I wasn't left very impressed by it. This did get me to pay more attention to the Fighter, however, as a class to base my samurai on. The Battle Master archetype already gets way closer to my vision of a samurai than the XGtE archetype seemed to be. It just requires a additions and tweaks. I've based these additions mostly off of my favorite Japanese styles – Iaido. I'm asking for everyone's help in ensuring the wording and balance are correct. Also, feel free to offer up names you think would be better.

These are my homebrew additions to the Fighter's ""Battle Master"" archetype.
Thanks for the suggestions. Please keep them coming. Presenting **Sword Release v0.2**

&gt; ***Sword Release*** (Optional subclass feature)
&gt; 
&gt; If you choose to take this feature once you enter the Battle Master archetype, you forfeit your current Fighting Style and lose any of the benefits it provided. Instead, you learn the Iaido Fighting Style. 
&gt; 
&gt; Using this feature, you learn to dispatch your foes before they ever see you draw your blade. You may use a bonus action on your turn to stow your melee weapon and enter a low fighting posture, ready to release your weapon and strike at a moment’s notice. This is your Sword Release stance. While in this stance, you gain +1 AC and are granted +1 to the next melee weapon attack you make from this stance. If the attack hits, you may also add +1 to the damage roll. You leave this stance once you attack, if you are knocked prone, or if a suitable weapon is not accessible to you. Additionally, the Maneuvers you may use while in this stance are limited to those which utilize this feature.
&gt; 
&gt; To use this feature, both hands must be free until you attack. Your melee weapon must deal slashing damage and must not have the Heavy weapon property. When you make a melee weapon attack from this stance with a Versatile weapon, you may calculate the attack’s damage as if you were holding the weapon with two hands.

.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; **Fighting Style**
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;**Iaido**
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;You may use a bonus action to enter the Sword Release stance.
 
***Maneuvers***

&gt; **Arterial Strike.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack from your Sword Release stance, you can expend one superiority die to deeply wound the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you have inflicted a bleeding effect on the target. At the start of each of its turns until the effect ends, the bleeding target takes damage equal to your Dexterity modifier. At the end of its turns, a bleeding creature can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends for that creature. The effect also ends if the target receives any magical healing. Bleeding does not effect undead or constructs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vanishing Strike.** When you are within 10 feet of a creature you can see while in your Sword Release stance on your turn, you may expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, you instantly appear in the space immediately opposite your target. You do not expend movement or provoke an attack of opportunity using this maneuver. If that space is occupied or inaccessible, you remain in your space and can continue your turn as normal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Blunt Edge.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack from your Sword Release stance, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to stun the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn. Your weapon deals bludgeoning damage for this attack.
&gt; 
&gt; **Riposte.** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. (Homebrew Addition:) You may use this maneuver from your Sword Release stance.

.

^Still ^waiting ^on ^improvements ^for:
&gt; **Defensive Posture.** If you are holding a melee weapon on your turn, you may use your action to expend one superiority die and enter a balanced stance until the start of your next turn. This stance ends early if you move or are knocked prone. While in this stance, you cannot take any of your normal reactions. Instead, whenever another creature damages you with a weapon attack, you may roll your superiority die and reduce the damage by the number rolled + your Dexterity modifier. You may then make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within your melee weapon’s range. If you hit, the damage you deal is equal to the number rolled on your superiority die. Repeat this process each time you take weapon damage during this stance. 

Defensive Posture is based on kendo’s chudan-no-kamae posture where strikes may often occur simultaneously, also known as ai-uchi, and result in mutual death during actual combat.

Choose one tool you’re proficient with. This tool is integrated into your body, and you double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks you make with it. You must have your hands free to use this integrated tool.

I'm choosing Tinker's Tools, which the Artificer is proficient in.

Under Spellcasting, the Artificer's description also reads:

You	produce	your artificer	spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s	tool—in	hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.

And the Artificer's Spellcasting Ability is Intelligence. DC and Attack Mod are calculated by adding 8 + Int Mod + Proficiency Mod.

All these facts together seem to \*imply\* that this character could add double its proficiency modifier for the sake of Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Modifier, but nothing I've found says it explicitly, and no other class works this way (AFAIK).

I wanted to bounce a quick idea I have for a Homebrew sandbox campaign where most magic items have limited charges, and once those charges are spent the item turns mundane.

I'm mostly thinking of armor and weapons right. An example: a +1 longsword has 50 charges. When you make an attack roll (hit or miss), you use a charge. After all charges are spent it turns into a normal longsword. 

Same for armor, whenever an enemy makes an attack against you, whether it hits or misses, you subtract a charge.

Perhaps all items lose a charge at midnight regardless to prevent magic hording items with low charges for that ""just in case"" moment.

I'm mostly looking for a fun factor. Would people consider this fun if it was fully fleshed out? I realize losing a cool magic affect on an item might be a drag but I'm hoping it gives a lot more incentive to dungeon delve and explore. ",dndnext,All magic items have limited charges

0,0,7,0,"A bit of backstory first, question is at the end.

I'm currently playing a Cleric, and a few sessions ago we had a really rough battle where my PC died and another was abducted, then also killed.

There were 4 of us at level 5 (at the time) and we were fighting 3 Cambions, which are apparently CR 5 fiends. We got overconfident and separated a significant distance over the battlefield (a market square in a city in the dead of night) trying to chase down 2 of the Cambions at once, and the Bard and Warlock were soon out of range of my healing spells.

The Cambion that myself and our EK fighter were taking on got in some nasty hits despite us both having heavy armour, and the third Cambion was flying around in between us getting free fire rays off on everyone. I went down first, and all 3 Cambions then dived on the other two. I got a nat 1 on my first death save, then the EK failed a medicine check to stabilize me, and I failed my next death save as well, so I died.

The Warlock and Bard both got taken down as well, and the Cambions circled around the Bard and vanished with him while the EK was running over, thinking it was going to be a TPK.

The Bard then had some solo RP with the DM, announcing about 5 minutes later that he was dead as well. Luckily, we had just saved the political leader of the city we were in from an illness that was being caused by another fiendish presence, related to the Cambions, and she had some ties with the temple of Chauntea, so my PC got resurrected, but the Bard had been killed on another plane after refusing to make a deal with Graz'zt, so he rerolled a Fighter.

Seeing as I am now the only source of healing (we also have a Rogue and a Monk, who weren't at that session - we usually only have 4 or 5 players available on any given weekend), I want to roll a backup PC who can heal in case I die again in the middle of nowhere.

I don't want to just make another Cleric though, as that would kind of feel like the typical scenario of Bob the barbarian dying only for his previously unmentioned brother Rob with an identical character sheet rocking up to replace him.

I decided on a Gnome Theurgy Wizard, taking Life domain, and that's where my question comes in... has anybody else noticed that the Gnomish pantheon has no Life domain deities? The only other pantheon that doesn't have one is the Drow pantheon. I know I can just ask the DM to let me choose one of the other Gnome gods, or choose one from the main Faerun pantheon, but I think it's kind of strange that there just isn't one, period.

I am already playing a divine soul / celestial warlock in my other main group, and druid doesn't really appeal to me.. I've wanted to play a support wizard for quite a while so I figure I can make him as my backup, but also have it ready to go if I happen to find a third group that I can fit into my schedule (in which case I will make something else as my backup for the Cleric PC).

As I understand RAW successfully grappling an opponent simply reduces their speed to zero, and that the grappler feat allows you to double down on your grapple with a pin and impose the restrained condition (on you both) adding the effect of advantage to attacks against the restrained parties/disadvantage on their attack rolls + disadvantage on Dex saves.

However I feel l like the act of bumrushing a terrifying mage, tackling them to the ground and slapping them in a choke 
hold should probably result in some difficulty with spellcasting beyond disadvantage on spells needing attack rolls, rather than them simply effortlessly gesturing one wizened hand and melting your face off with a Cone of Cold at no disadvantage.

For example - if you were using your pin/action to focus on controlling their hands would it be reasonable to somehow penalise spells requiring somatic components?

If you were commiting instead to a choke or smother instead perhaps the verbal component could be more difficult?

Below is the text explaining the change for my players at the outset of a new campaign - I think it explains what I'd like to do, why, and the mechanics behind it. It's inspired by Burning Wheel but I think still sufficiently D&amp;D that I'm not totally trying to have my cake and eat it too. All my players DM as well so they know their stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quest and Goal-based experience**

I’m adjusting the milestone experience model for this campaign to encompass the completion of quests I give you as well as achieving goals characters set. I don’t have much to say about Quest-based experience – if you complete a quest or reach a milestone, I’ll award the party experience.

Goal-based experience is more complex so I want to share why I’m doing this, the mechanics of how it will work, and provide some examples.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why use Goal-based experience**

I think the biggest problem with D&amp;D is that characters are painfully static. The only real mechanics used to express character growth is increasing level, gaining better loot, and becoming infinitely wealthy. That’s fun and simple, but I think it makes characters really two dimensional.

Goal-based experience is about making characters dynamic. What they think and feel about the world – and how they grow and change from interacting with it – isn’t mechanically in the game. The number one reason I’m introducing this system is to try and change that.

Briefly there are a few other benefits;

* Your goals are a way for you to communicate to me and other players what interests you about the game – it presents avenues for exploration, ideas for quests I can develop, and can deepen relationships with players as you get into the habit of collaborating on goals.
* It cuts down on the amount of preparation the DM needs to do dramatically. I’ll know what you care about, want to pursue, and get ideas from you – it makes us co-creators of a shared narrative rather than me trying to railroad you into an adventure you may only be partially interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does it work?**

1. Everyone advances level at the same rate. Goal-based experience doesn’t mean you’re fighting to get your way or lead the party every session – it’s an opportunity to share the spotlight.
2. We’ll explicitly talk about your Goals before each session, or over the pre-game dinner. We want people to be clear on what everyone wants to do so you can decide as a group what to pursue.
3. You can abandon or change goals between sessions. Just like a real person your characters perspectives and priorities will change often. This is a good thing – it’s representative of your characters evolving thoughts, feelings, and priorities.
4. If you’re changing goals, you need to post that to our Campaign Forum by noon on Saturday. Not changing in a given week is totally fine – it’s okay to take the back seat for a session or two. See (1) in this section.
5. Goals are a conversation between the DM and the players. I do, however, reserve the right to approve, deny, or suggest changes to them – but this will always be done in the spirit of fairness and good narrative!
6. You each start with two Goal slots.

a. **Current goal:** These relate to either the situation the party is in or a story thread you want to explore. I’ll describe, with examples, below.

b. **Character goal:** These relate to either a PC or NPC that shine a spotlight on the relationship and how it should change. They exist to deepen bonds and manage conflict in interesting ways. I’ll describe, with examples, below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current goals in play**

These relate to either the situation the party is in, or a story thread you want to explore. They explicitly tell me what to prepare between sessions and to help all the players understand how your character thinks and feels about current circumstances.

Here are some examples:

Lets say we have a session after the PCs have returned to a major city after completing a quest. You have no immediate quests on the horizon and I have a blank slate from a planning perspective. We’re a few weeks into the campaign though and I’ve dropped any number of hints about different storylines you could pursue.

* The party cleric might think about a rumour I mentioned in a previous session about Demon worship among the local aristocracy. The cleric thinks that’s an awesome idea and wants to include it in the next phase of our story. \*\*So they write a goal: “\*\****I will discern the truth of these rumours and learn who among the aristocracy are worshiping dark powers.”***

Current goals can also relate to a specific quest if you have one. And it's not a bad thing if you try to ""double dip"" and get Quest and Goal XP - so long as they're good goals that enhance the narrative. With that in mind lets say I’ve given you the quest to kill the Mad Mage of Undermountain.

* The Rogue character might decide their family was killed by the Mad Mage. This could be existing cannon from their backstory, or something that’s proposed between sessions. They like the idea of this bringing out a vengeful side of their character, a side that will take risks to strike the killing blow against this enemy. They write the goal, ***“the Mad Mage will pay for what they did to my family – they MUST die by my hand.***
* The Wizard, who plays a mostly stereotypical power-hungry type, might decide that while they support this quest they also want to steal the Mad Mage’s terrible arcane secrets. They decide to propose an additional element to the quest and canon about the Mad Mage by writing the goal of, ***“I will uncover the mysteries of the Mad Mage’s hidden laboratory!”***As a DM I can now go off and make a map and encounter with whatever Frankenstein/Flesh Golem monster the Mad Mage was perfecting in their hidden lab. I can choose to go a step further and decide this is a hidden location and that you’ll need to first figure out where it is before it can be raided.

From these examples I think it’s obvious how helpful it will be for the DM of a sandbox-style game to get a snapshot of what the PCs care about before any given session. With goals you help create the story and lessen my burden and chance of burnout.

&amp;#x200B;

**Character goals in play**

Character goals relate to either a PC or NPC that are meant to put you in your characters mindset. They exist to deepen the bonds between characters and make for a richer story. They’re also a way of heightening drama and managing conflict between players.

Lets continue the stories from above for our examples.

* The Cleric, who is intent on uncovering demonic influence within the aristocracy, knows that uncovering these cults will require subterfuge and connections they don’t have. They know the Rogue character has a Noble background and is estranged from their family. They write the goal, ***“I will help the Rogue reconcile with their father and convince them to help us purge evil influences upon the aristocracy.”***
* Before the session the Rogue character agrees this will make for a great story, but they want to expand on it and flavour it more to their feud with the family. They write the goal, ***“It’s time my father and I talked about how he squandered my inheritance. I’ve seen the good in him and he can atone by helping us uncover the cult.”***

I now have queues for an awesome adventure that includes character backstory, a chance for a meaningful NPC interaction, and a quest to infiltrate an aristocratic cult. This is awesome!

0,0,5,8,"I recently started a Dragon Heist campaign and we borrowed the party creation mechanics from [Fate Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/phase-trio) and the results were amazing.

For those not familiar with the system, after creating a broad stroke character concept each player comes up with an origin story or pivotal, defining moment for their character. This should be no more than a few sentences.

Then, two other players (chosen arbitrarily or at random) have to somehow cross paths with each other player. They could be a rival, an old friend, a random chance encounter and now they're meeting again, etc. This should also only be a few sentences. It ensured that nobody knew everybody in the party beforehand but everybody knew somebody else and they all shared mutual acquaintances. 

We spent the majority of our session zero on this, leaving everyone to handle their mechanical character creation on their own time. 

We ended up with a well fleshed out party that was ingrained into the city of Waterdeep. There were some really satisfying connections made in the party that we never would have thought of without being forced down a given path. 

Constraint breeds creativity. And being nudged to non-obvious and non-cliche connections bore wonderful fruit. 

I would encourage people to give it a try. Of course you shouldn't be bound by these rules and if something doesn't work feel free to deviate. But putting on emphasis on this aspect of character creation in a focused way can lead to really satisfying results. ",dndnext,Borrowing Mechanics from Fate Core for Party Creation

0,0,29,0,"Hi, I've been trying to find conclusive answers to this, where I've heard conflicting reports about how spell slots work for the wizard class, so I've come here to see if my luck will be better.

&amp;#x200B;

The two ways that spell slots work in 5e from what I've been told and from what I've gleamed from research has been:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Spell slots are essentially mana, meaning that if you have five level 1 spell slots then you can cast any level 1 spell five times per day, i.e. one level 1 spell multiple times or a combination of level 1 spells over the course of the day as I see fit.

or

&amp;#x200B;

2. At the start of each day, I have to pick which spells I assign to whichever spell slots, meaning that if I have eight level 1 spells, and only five level 1 slots, then I have to pick which of the eight that I think I'll need to use that day, and have to assign multiple slots to the same spell if I feel I need to use it multiple times. (i.e. if I want to use, say, burning hands multiple times in a single day, then I have to preemptively assign it to a few of my limited spell slots at the start of the day and can't change my choice until the next long rest)

&amp;#x200B;

The general answer that I've found from research is that it's the first method that's used in 5e, but from what I've heard in my circle of friends, the show Critical Role uses the second system so we're a bit confused on the ruling, despite what the book says. I haven't watched Critical Role so I don't know if the claim about them using the second method is true and if it is, whether or not it's one of their house rules. I'm asking here to get clarification.",dndnext,How do spell slots work in 5e for the Wizard?

- Doesn't need to be a selected spell (Sorcerers/Warlocks/Wizards pick spells on level-up)

I've played a Wizard recently, and always prepared Misty Step, and the only times I've ever *wanted* to spend the 2nd-level-spell-slot on mobility, there's always been a more appropriate spell for the situation, which means out of all the sessions I've had, I never ended up using Misty Step (despite it costing me the prepared spell slot this whole time). 


This, combined with another noteworthy ability:


&gt;Intuitive Motion. When you make a Strength (Athletics) check ~~or any ability check to operate or maintain a land vehicle,~~ you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.


Adding a d4 to grapple attacks? Yes please.

The building itself is a mimic, all the staff and other patrons are part of the facade and the mimic waits for everyone to go to sleep for an easy meal.

0,0,10,13,"Hi all,

I am DM'ing a game right now and things are about to get wild for my party. The setting is at a summer camp, with a deep dark secret, and each player is in a cabin based on one of the 6 skills (STR/DEX/CHA, etc.) They had a team challenge that required the team to be assigned an NPC named Hank, a human bard from the Charisma cabin. The next leg of the campaign takes them into a dungeon of a powerful necromancer lich which hides the dark past about the camp and the previous headmaster.  The party broke into the current headmasters house and found clues about the previous headmaster and escaped without being caught, but the headmaster did detect the Wizard of our group (the party doesnt know that.).    

They will face a variety of challenges all based on the skills they are gaining while at camp, and all VERY dangerous. Since none of my players are bards (or particularly skilled in charisma) I'm sending Hank along with them as there is a musical-based obstacle that I seriously dont think the party will get through without a bards help, if they will accept his help. My assumption is they will.    

During our last game, I secretly gave the wizard in our party a note at the end of the session that was addressed from the headmaster of the camp that just said ""when the time comes, trust Hank."" I do not know his feelings about the note.    

I want to give the party some  ownership of including or not including Hank, either before or during the dungeon encounter. My party already doesnt like bards.

For example, the PCs are at a house. Some went inside, others outside, without specifically declaring that they are looking out for anything. Then, let's say a bunch of goblins try to set up an ambush right outside the house, and roll insanely well for stealth. So much in fact that it is impossible for any PCs' passive perception to catch even a glimpse of a goblin toe. The PCs join up in front of the house again after some time, at which point the goblins would jump into attack mode. 

And what then? Is it really as simple as ""well nobody (players and PCs) suspects any attack and nobody was keeping watch or indicating something that would be a perception check, so too bad for you guys, everybody is surprised by a horde of goblins right outside the house!

This temple once was use to worship Umberlee The Bitch Queen. She saw it fit to house her most valuable treasure within this temple (female sphynx on top floor) However, as time went on and steam came into production people started fearing her less and less. This lead to fewer and fewer pilgrimage from those seeking her blessing. Eventually the temple stopped recieving visitors. Eventually a Medusa moved in with some lizardmen. Upon learning of this, Umberlee decided that no one deserves her blessing, and sanke the temple to the bottom of the lake. Only the top of the temple sticks out, marking it's presence.

Seeing this as the perfect place to house it's aquariam, a Morkoth moved into the lowest level, and has been collecting aquatic, and undead creatures within it's depths. No one has dared venture out to the temple since it fell into the lake, fearing reprisal.

A group of undead found this temple to be the perfect place to hold a dimensional tether so that they can gather their forces before attacking and corrupting the world above. They have no knowledge of the Morkoth beneath, and are unaware that they have become a part of his collection.

0,0,71,5,"Personally I find the 5e weapons list a little lacking. There are a good amount of weapons but I feel like they are super not balanced, where the best weapons get picked by everyone and the bad ones just aren’t worth it without home-brewing. 
For example, take a look at all of the weapons that do 1d4 damage, the dagger is obviously the best, light, thrown, finesse, then the strength version of the dagger, the light hammer. Then there’s the dart, finesse and thrown, with the only upside probably being that you’d be able to carry a bunch for throwing compared to daggers. Then there’s the whip, which has a new damage type (slashing, as opposed to piercing), with reach and finesse, so at least it has reach to make it have use, but it’s also a martial weapon!! Who with martial proficiency would use a whip for 1d4 damage when you could use anything else, like darts. Then you get to the disappointing end, with the club, which is only good if you use shillelagh which isn’t even in the phb, and the sickle, which is just the worst and has no reason to be picked, not finesse (which to me should have been obvious for it to have), can’t throw it because ofc, and only a d4 of damage. And these kind of problems pop up kinda everywhere. Yea different damage types but there aren’t enough enemies with resistance to only one type of physical damage to warrant having multiple of these for he variety, why not just pick the best option? Why should you be penalized for wanting a Character to be quirky and use a different weapon, pretty much everyone funnels into dagger and rapier for finesse weapons. The only class of weapons I feel aren’t that big of a problem are the heavy two handed weapons, the main difference is how they add up damage (I.e. 2d6 v 1d12) or trading off a little damage for reach (glaive v greataxe)
And the versatile weapons feel kinda bad too, like the quarterstaff being pretty much the same as the trident, except the trident gets thrown property at the cost of martial proficiency which to me is a lot.
And there are weapons like the mace that have absolutely no use, it does the same damage as a one handed quarterstaff. Think about that, a mace and a quarterstaff, a hunk of metal and a small wooden pole do the same amount of strength based damage.
The easy way out in all of this is just using one weapons stat block and just flavor it like it’s another weapon but I don’t like that, I hate having to switch everything around and just use my one generic weapon statblock because only one of the weapons is worth it. 
giving more enemies resistances to one type or two of physical damage would make it worth it, or buffing weapons that are just objectively worse would also help.

The group is going to be mostly first time players, and I'm gonna have them level up to level 3 so they can be semi-competent characters within the world. the campaign I'm running is basically a game of Jumanji. I like this because if they players die, their characters won't actually die, they'll wake up at the end with a red X on their faces, so I can really play around with the situations. My big questions are this:

Some of the ""punishments"" the board game will throw at them are enemies. I'm not sure I know how to properly balance an enemy to my players yet. There are other punishments that are along the lines of snakes or wasps coming out of nowhere, a fire storm raining from above, etc. These are things that I'm excited to try, but...I'm not really sure how to handle?

0,0,20,2,"So since Ravnica has been released, I'm thinking it's only a matter of time (even though it may be a LONG time) that Dark Sun and Dragonlance get a campaign book of their own. Dragonlance, even with its ownership issues under Margarat Weiss/Tracey Hickman I still think will eventually get something in 5E eventually, as Tracey collaborated with Wizard's for Curse of Strahd.

But Dark Sun and Dragonlance have some funny timeline issues. When initially released as campaign settings they started as well-defined lands with governments, alliances and power structures. But since that initial release, they've had their ""timeline"" greatly expanded.

In the case of Dark Sun, what started with I think about eleven city-states and sorcerer-kings was the main draw and struggle of the setting. But Dark Sun got itself a whole set of novels, and some adventure modules, that last left off with leaving only six sorcerer kings left alive, two of them being sort-of good and a third trapped in Ravenloft.

With Dragonlance, the author and co-creator Weiss kept churning out novels bringing the settings story a several massive wars ahead of its initial launch, with some pretty world-defining changes on the way. There been a War of the Lance, War of Souls, and the two big gods Paladine and Takhisis have lost their divinity.

So the dillemma is essentially this; do you release a campaign book for these settings by establishing a retcon, essentially saying ""That stuff in the novels/modules isn't really canon, the setting hasn't moved."" Dark Sun has done this in the past. Or do you do the Forgotten Realms path, and say ""That stuff did happen, you play in the present and everything detailed in previous modules/novels is the setting's history.""

In my point of view, I think these new campaign books should put a foot in both camps. They should detail the events of the past from novels and modules as a brief outline, and explain enough details that DMs could feel comfortable replaying those events/modules if they so choose (so you can fight the dragon Borys or Verminaard if you want). But lso detail the present, so that DMs can also feel free to create their own world-shaking events, characters and plotlines within the setting's present if they choose.

So for example, in the case of Dark Sun, do a brief overview of the history of the sorcerer-kings (all of them), explain the conflicts in the modules/novels in which some of them perished, and give some background for how DMs could set games in that previous age. But then also give details about the ""current"" year, and the current status of cities and their kings, so that DMs can take the remaining threads and run with them (instead of feeling boxed to replay what has already been made). There should be some new details added to the ""present"" year for adventure hooks to be devised (like the Thri-Keen Empire, or about Daskinor's rumored actions).

Same with Dragonlance, in that they should give details on the War of the Lance and the War of Souls, and the key players in those events so DMs can feel like they could play in those timelines. But also add enough details to the current year so that DMs can run games post-novels as well, with some flavor pieces (maybe Kitiara is rumored resurrected as a servant of Chemosh or something, I dunno).

So those are my ideas. Is everything I wrote just total bunk and they should retcon it all, or completely move forward like Forgotten Realms does, or am I onto something?",dndnext,5th Edition Timeline for Dark Sun/Dragonlance Discussion

They're called the Sha'Rax-Ti, a race of insect-like creatures that form a consciousness once enough have gathered. Due to the ease in which the swarm can get separated, they infest the bodies of other deceased humanoids as to keep their form together.

(Lore is still being developed, but that's the jist.) It's mainly the traits I'd like help balancing. I've tried to use Detect Balance's ratings as a guideline, which you'll see the value next to each ability on what I believe it was rated.Overall, the race comes out to a 24, when 26.5 is considered 'average'.Key Words&gt; Xkrith - Single drone within the collective&gt; Host - The body the Sha'Rax-Ti is infesting

&amp;#x200B;

**Ability Score Increase (12).** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

**Age.** Individual Xkrith live around three months, though through replacing lost of drones, you are effectively immortal.

**Alignment.** A complex relationship with mortality and physical existence leads most Sha'rax Ti to be Chaotic, often tending towards evil alignments.

**Size.** Though your swarm's total number varies considerably from day to day, you require enough drones to fill a Medium Humanoid to maintain consciousness.

**Speed (-2).** The restriction of inhabiting a body reduces the speed it would normally be capable of. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Aberrant Nature (0).** You have two creature types: aberration and humanoid. You can be affected by any game effects that target either of these types.

**Buzzing Swarm (0).** You can perform verbal components for spells through the chittering, writhing and quivering sounds of your bodies.

**Cyclic Rest (4).** You rotate the time when your drones are resting, keeping many awake at all times. You do not need to sleep and can complete a long rest by performing 6 hours of light activity.

**Infested Host (6).** You survive by infesting the corpse of a medium humanoid. This corpse is considered your *Host*. While the swarm can replace the drones lost from injury or time, it cannot repair the corpse it inhabits. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, your *Host* will become damaged. While your *Host* is undamaged, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary member of your *Host's* race, though your actions may give you away. While your *Host* is damaged, other creatures are more easily able to recognise you as Sha'Rax-Ti.

If you have access to a medium humanoid corpse, you can choose to infest it over the course of a Short Rest and make it your new *Host*. You must complete a long rest before you can infest another corpse.

**Mental Touch (6).** The collective mental prowess of your swarm allows you to reach out to the minds of others. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

**Psychically Unstable (-8).** The psychic connection that holds your swarm together is a fragile thing. You have vulnerability to psychic damage.

**Purge the Infected. (6)** By removing weakened drones from the swarm, you can prevent the spread of dangerous substances. You have resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.

**Languages (0).** You are not capable of speech yourself, but you can understand, read and write Common and one other language of your choice.

0,0,4,0,"So, I'm reaching a critical moment in my Curse of Strahd campaign; the party has *finally* entered Castle Ravenloft. I' really happy about this, but it leaves me with two potential issues, so I thought I'd ask here on them, as people here can help save me from myself, when my changes, and stupid ideas take root.

1. Railroading: I've added a secondary batch of things to the ""typical"" CoS campaign, to try and make each of the characters feel like they were chosen for a reason, by Barovia's Darklord, and while the players sort of know that, and several of the ""triggers"" have been done, there is one more big one, and I am thinking of hitting it tonight. The problem is, once it is tripped, the party probably shouldn't leave the castle, and beating Strahd/staying alive becomes the only goal. He's been keen to let them screw around, but at that point, he's set to do them in, and get his reward. If I don't hit the trigger, though, and they run into Strahd, anyway, it would be pretty hard to later drop it in; this might be the best time to do it, and also maybe end this campaign, so people can maybe win, and play something else. There are still locales of Barovia they haven't checked, but they might never, and have found most of the goodies. How much ""railroading"" should I risk? Most campaigns have a ""and we're going to fight the BBEG, but not CoS, and even going to the castle isn't guaranteeing you don't leave; several events only happen if you *did* go to the castle, do some stuff, and then go other places. What might be the best way to handle this?

2. Optional Battle: I hate the Heart of Sorrows. Strahd sort of *needs* it, especially with my party, but it's so easily destroyed. Even with some spawn in the room, it's nothing but a big ""crush me!!!"" item, and they will, causing Strahd to lose another combat-advantage. As much as I've whined about that, and people have given opinions on it, I *really* want Strahd to feel CR 16. I thought of spicing it up with a battle; they break the Heart, they find an Atropal inside. I really like the stat block, and they have so much Radiant damage output they still probably won't suffer too hard for it, but it could just LA-Wail every turn, tossing out Exhaustion levels, and Life Drain on its turn, to sort of tank damage. They are about the same level as one would expect for the campaign you are expected to fight one in, so that doesn't really worry me, and it fits, for me, protecting Strahd's ""healing"" power. Again, with all the radiant damage they can dish out, I think they could even kill it, but the problem is the exhaustion. As much as I like the idea of the rest of the castle getting a break from their weakened state, they might feel they *have* to leave, to recover those Exhaustion levels, and then have to agree to go back later. That might be bad, but if #1 is implemented, this becomes even worse, as they might *have* to stay in the castle, with 2+ levels of exhaustion under their belts. They could flee from it, and there'd be a roving Atropal in the castle, maybe even getting out, and drifting down to the towns below, or stand and fight; their call. Should I skip the fight, and just say ""yep, Strahd will be that much easier to beat"", or give them an option to have a really cool encounter? ToA doesn't feel bad about it, when they *can't* retreat, and death is permanent, so should CoS?

Thanks for your ideas on these matters. Please have a good one!!!",dndnext,CoS - Railroading and an Optional Battle? (Minor Spoilers)
0,0,16,0,"So I hate math.  Because it makes me think. When I think I see flaws.  Bladesinger is my target right now.

Your expected to be in melee.  Even with high ac you have low hp *and your in melee*

Every time your hit you have to make a con save.  Starting at DC 10.  If your in blade song you can add your int modifier.  For me this would give me a total of +5 (2 from con and 3 from int)

So if I roll a 5 or less I fail.  Higher if I take over 20 damage.

This becomes a big problem at high level.  Average hp 6 per level.  6x15 is 90 hp.  If I get hit for 30 that's a DC 15 (probably a light hit too at 15).  That means I have to roll a10 or higher.

That haste /web or whatever super important spell is gonna get dropped that was saving the parties ass.

You essentially have to invest into resilient con and warcaster.  Getting proficiency with concentration and advantage.

Issue.

As a blade singer you need to max dex/int to stay relevant.  That means at best you have room for 1 feat.  Can't pick both. 

Pushing this further survival really depends on mobile feat.  Ability to remove someone's ability to attack you.  Dash through difficult terrain.  50ft movement during song. 

No way you have room for 3 feats.

So this means web/haste /even shadows blade *are trap options* unless you have much faith in your dice worship.

Question is can you make an effective non concentration bladesinger?

0,0,9,1,"I'm part of a group playing through rise of tiamat.  Characters are level 8 and the party dynamic has been a delight (there's three of us, a firlbog, a kenku, and myself, a half-orc).

&amp;#x200B;

The DM texted each of us recently and asked us what we wanted for our characters.  As in, what are our intentions for further developing their personalities and desires as unique characters.  The DM is looking to provide us with opportunities throughout the quest to expand upon the lore from our backstories, and bring us through character arcs that will affect our PCs.

&amp;#x200B;

I love this kind of stuff, and have several character this would be perfect for, but with my half-orc, I'm having some trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory-wise, he's a half-orc that used to be in the army as a high ranking officer, but was medically discharged due to an injury that blinded him.  Because of the blow to his ego and the lack of a job, he fell from grace, eventually becoming homeless and hated by the community.  On the verge of death, he was taken in by monk, who nursed him back to health and taught him to take hold of his life and health through meditation and yadda yadda monk stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

After years, he left the monostary because of the cult activity in Horde of the Dragon Queen, deciding that now that he was 'healed' and ready to take action with his new skills, it was his duty to take up the mantle of a warrior once again and combat evil that threatened the land.

&amp;#x200B;

SO.  This guy has kind of already been through his defining character arc.  He's already hit rock bottom and has pulled himself up to a functioning state and is content.  He's also old for a half-orc.  Not quite elderly, but getting there.  I'd love to challenge his character but I'm not sure what kind of change I want him to go through.  I don't know what a realistic flaw to exploit for a disciplined, ex-soldier, now-monk would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I considered his old unit requesting for him to rejoin, which I think in a novel or short story would be great, but in a DnD game the threat of him going back isn't realistic since I would never actually have him leave the campaign.

0,0,1,1,"TLDR: Need help on how Archfey react to mortal deals and how they would look after one as part of this deal. Also help on deciding between 3 classes.

Greetings all! I wanted to get some advice and ideas on a few things. Im going to roll a half elf who has obtained magical power through a deal with an archfey. I want this character (Khal Venrie) to be a cute cinnamonbun that needs protecting from the dangers of the world. I haven't really looked into fey stuff and so i wouldnt know what would be appropiate in terms of the backstory. What it boils down to is that Khal didnt really have any magic power in him to the dismay of his loving mother. Many of the kids would pick on him with their own magic and just be a step ahead of him in life. To be fair, Khal didn't really mind and was content in cheering on his friends and just having fun with other things essentially.

&amp;#x200B;

His mom however believed that he desperately needed to gain some sort of magical essence in order to protect himself and be happy. And so she made a deal with an archfey entity and got to the agreement that once Khal reached a certain age (20) she would come with this entity to the feywild to act as a servant for the rest of her days in exchange for ""Protection"" in the form of the unearthing of the innate magical abilities that was burried deep inside him as well as just keeping a loose eye on him over his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Khal wasnt okay with losing his mother but knew better than to challenge an archfey thanks to the tales he grew up with. After a tearful goodbye, He set out immediately to find a way to free his mother from this deal wether it be through some sort of trade that would please this Archfey lord or just becoming strong enough to free her himself.

&amp;#x200B;

This is basically the backstory for my character, i will be fleshing it out more obviously but i wanted to ask if these seems like an okay interaction between a mortal and an archfey lord? Khal's mother is a very powerful witch so it's not like she is a random peasant so it would make sense that the archfey would be okay with this ""trade"". Any lore on the archfey to keep in mind would also be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

The other part of my question would be what class would make the most sense for Khal to be?  
I have 3 possible choices in mind:  
A) Wild Magic Sorcerer- One of the possible origins that the Book recommends is in fact being blessed by a fey creature which would fit the bill quite nicely.

B) Fey Origin Sorcerer- Homebrew Sorcerer Origin from [dmsguild](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/250669/Four-new-Sorcerer-Origins). This one im the most on the fence about since it's kind of less of a blessing  and more of innate Fey powers. It still mixes nicely with the fey aspects of my character's powers and i can just reflavor stuff to better suit me.

C) Archfey Warlock- While This character didn't willingly go into this pact with this entity, i think that the bonuses and abilities obtained through it might work out rather well with the roleplay.

Basically long ago the wood elves lived in this city and worshipped a specific deity. The deity abandoned them for some reason and so many of them left the city. some elves remained but due to the immense despair of the elves the forest became a conduit to the shadowfell which brought forth a shadow dragon.

made in light of the new [Artificer's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#Alchemist) Homunculus. I am using the PHB Ranger after it has been updated with all the errata.

- Your beast companion has not 4 but 6 times your Ranger level in hp

- You can add your proficiency bonus to any ability saving throw the beast makes (in addition to AC, damage,  and attack rolls)

-  If the Beast has multiattack, it doesn't anymore. (ninja edit: it regains it at 11th level Ranger with Bestial Fury!)

- Certain CR 1/2 creatures, like the Ape and the Black Bear are acceptable options.

- While bonding to a new companion still takes 8 hours and requires the beast to be non-hostile, you can also resurrect your beast by spending 1 hour within 5 feet of its body and expending a 1st level spell slot to resurrect it, bringing it back with 1 HP. (this is the one I want most discussion on - should I allow resurrection without the body? I'm pretty happy with the lack of a GP cost and use of a spell slot at the moment)

- Regardless of the stat block, your beast has a pool of d10 hit dice equal to your Ranger level, which it can expend during a short rest per the Errata.

- In addition to the Ranger's Companion ability, you gain the benefits of Exceptional Training at 3rd level, however it doesn't grant the ability to overcome resistances and immunity to damage.

- At 7th level, you gain the following ability:

&gt; **Superior Beast Defense:** When your beast is forced to make a saving throw, it has advantage on the saving throw as long as you are within 30 feet of it. In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical weapons.

0,0,8,0,"So my beef is with the artificer or artificer , (yes people pronounce it differently). To the discussion above this is about its spark of the class. Some will instantly point out how
*Barbarian has rage
*Bard has bardic inspiration
*cleric has channel divinity and the ability to call their god
*Druid has wild shape
*Fighter has the most ASI and Action surge
*Monk has his martial arts which gives a variety of stuff like flurry of blows, increasing dmg die, and stunning strikes
*Paladin has smites and aura of protection
*Ranger has a lot of terrain and enemy target type abilities
*sorcerer has metamagic which lets him bend spells
*warlock has invocation and recovering spells at short rest
*wizards have the largest spell list,  arcane recover, and mastering spells

The problem of have for artificer is that it’s base class feels incomplete. Yes it has cantrips and rituals but you traded martial weapon, heavy armor, and fighting style, if you compare to other half casters paladin and rangers. Infused items have only 5 unique things and the other option is to replicate a magic item. I feel it is lacking because you could get armor or weapon that is +1 or +2 or pick up a magic item. The armor of resistance can be replace with ring of resistance, the pouch is a better version of bag of holding when its with small items. The returning is nice but you have to remember is that the throwing weapons don’t have the support, the thing I did was using darts. The get tool proficiency 

I feel the artificer should had gotten a little bit more maybe expertise on knowledge (or any skill) since they are seeker of lore. Maybe give them three skills instead of two. Or maybe give them a fighting style to boost how they fight (god I would love twf). Maybe some more unique spells that could be focused on your weapon(s),  maybe another buff, or maybe one we haven’t seen yet. The subclass adds nice support or dmg output but I feel the subclass should not define the class. 

What do you guys recommend.

Tl;dr artificer rant about not feeling unique enough probably because of lack of options. I feel the builds would focus on dex/int because it feels focused on crossbows though you could have a good budget build with strength after 12th with gauntlet of orge power/ belt of hill giant strength.

0,0,19,3,"So I'm happy with my table's party composition for my Dark Souls based campaign, and I know there shouldn't be any favorites, but I especially like the fighter. He's a knight with a split personality that was a result of a curse from a jealous suitor of a girl he was friends with. It really shows how broken the character is in how he fights in a deranged, savage manner. Particularly he likes jumping into the fight, literally.  


With his 5 to strength mod, and a plus 3 from the jumping rules he can jump as far as 8 feet, normally. He asked if that could give him advantage on his two melee attacks on the downward crashing arc. I was intrigued by this, and decided on the ruling:  


Any attack while coming down from 10+ feet height, assuming the enemy is standing at 0 ft will grant you advantage on your attacks before you land. Any creature size above large will need a +10 to the falling height. Your character and inventory total weight will have to be significant enough (I said 500 would be enough to crush through the defenses)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty cool with Unearthed Arcana, so he took Fell-handed along with a slew of other goodies.   


He jumps well past his previously mentioned 8 feet to 16 from the option that a player can jump beyond his or her total jump height if he or she passes an athletics check. He gets a +10 to athletics from the prodigy feat.   


So every turn he's jumping into the enemy, slamming down with 20+ damage and forcing enemies prone without the need of superiority dice.

Then suddenly a full transformation takes place and she becomes an Aasimar. 

So the build is a Cavalier fighter and a celestial warlock or divine soul sorcerer.

I have a complicated relationship with combat in D&amp;D. Hooray — so dramatic! Oh no — so rigid!

&amp;#x200B;

I was recenty invited to play in a new group by a friend/more of an acquaintence of mine.  He's the only person I know in the group.  The DM and other two players are strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

Session 0 went well.  Gonna have to adjust to a new group's playstyle, but that's fine.  My worries stem from the answer to a question I asked at the end of the session: ""How forgiving will this quest be, should I invest in a miniature for my dude, or is there a good chance he'll die pretty early on?""

&amp;#x200B;

To this, the DM responded with (paraphrased) ""It'll be a chill quest, but I have it set up as a bunch of viniettes about different groups of adventurers, so every 4 levels or so, an arc will end and you guys will roll up brand new characters, picking up at the level your previous characters left of.  Your previous characters might show up as NPCs/ the subject of stories or legends.  I wouldn't get a miniature cuz you won't be playing any one character for very long.""

&amp;#x200B;

This was a huge red flag for me, not because of player or character behavior or attitudes, etc, but simply because I think it totally goes against the whole point of developing a character (mechanically and personality wise).  It's a problem for me personally because I know I'll have a hard time being invested in a character if their stats, items, connections to NPCs, and character development aren't going to matter in 6-8 sessions.  Not to mention any work I might do on a backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is even more problematic for one of the other players at the table, a guy who has never played before.  Learning the game from scratch is already a long arduous, sometimes intimidating endeavor, especially trying to master casting classes.  Not only is this player going to have to learn an entirely new class and their mechanics every arc, they will be trying to learn a new class starting at a higher level each time.  Imagine having never played a warlock and then trying to learn the basic mechanics, pact magic, pick a pact, pact boon, and innvocations for an 8th level character, when you barely know the game at all.  Even a fighter is gonna give a new player some trouble all their abilities at once.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I feel likeI should voice my concerns, BUT with me being completely new to this group of people, I'm second guessing myself a little, maybe I'm overreacting, maybe I put too much value into individual characters- this might be a good chance to experiement with classes I don't usually play or multiclassing, etc.  MY QUESTION(s) TO YOU GOOD FOLKS HERE ON REDDIT:

Under these circumstances, would you have the same worries?  Is it a problem worth voicing my concerns over?  Has anyone else played a campaign like this?  How did it go?

&amp;#x200B;

If this setup is something that will hinder the game in the long run, I have no problem voicing that.  Communicaion is key.  I just don't want to shoot down a new DMs first homebrew campaign idea if it's really a non-issue, especially being 'the new guy.'  But if the campaign falls apart because the new guy is too confused and looses interest and the rest of us don't care about our characters, I don't wanna be like ""well I COULDA warned you this might happen... but I didn't! :D""

I run a weekly game at my local shop and my players just defeated Marlos Urnrayle and the (nerfed) stone golem in the Temple of the Black Earth. However, two of my players were turned to stone by Marlos’ Stone Gaze and the party made a deal with his lieutenant to leave the Temple if he returned my players to flesh (I know that’s not how it works but we house ruled it some with Wish and the Earth Genasi). 

My question is should I count the cult as defeated and run the encounters the book describes, count the cult as not defeated and wait for my players to knock someone else out, or run the encounters and keep the Earth cult on the table still? My thought is that they don’t have Ironfang so they can’t do some of the Fane or Elemental Caves stuff without that; but the book says “when they’ve killed the prophet and the monster in B23, the cult is done”. So going strictly by the book, they’ve done what they needed to. My gut says to start retaliating with the Earth Cult still around though. 

The party is headed back to town for rest and to maybe get some new weaponry but I want them to start to feel less safe on the road “home”. I’m thinking of a Retaliation encounter and/or a devastation orb but I’m not sure how much is too much or if I’m overthinking this whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say an enemy is in between a fighter with Sentinel and a rogue and attempts to flee without disengaging. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the fighter attacks first and hits the enemy stops dead in his tracks and is no longer leaving the rogues threat range. Does the rogue still get his attack of opportunity? In this case i would say NO since the enemy is no longer leaving his threat range due to sentinel. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER if we reverse the attack order and the rogue attacks and hits first then the fighter could as well and then hits and stops him dead in his tracks and they both can get their attacks of opportunity in.

So how do you rule this? Is there anywhere that this is officially asked and answered? Would you play it out based on dex/initiative?

Has anyone had some experience with a similar situation before? Any tips on how to handle the pressure and cold?

It sounds like we will be under the effects of extreme cold, so making saves to avoid levels of exhaustion each turn. Coupled with the intense pressure at certain depths causing slight damage (1-2 d6) each turn and potentially more exhaustion. The issue is that we need to be our humanoid form (for the most part) to navigate the lair, and fight the kraken (or any of the other creatures down there). The pressure and cold won't become an issue until after 1,000 feet down, but I believe we are going to be going at least 3,000 feet. Without straight-up telling us the numbers, it sounds like the DM told us the conditions will worsen every 1,000 feet down below the first 1,00 feet. 

I am hearing out all suggestions and ideas, but here are a few things we are dealing with:

1. There are a lot of us going down, like 20 people in total
2. We have access to a lot of magic (a lot of casters, some capable of 9th level spells, although probably rule out Wish)

DM has bailed us out many times, and generally enforces things loosely to allow fuckery (as long as it is funny and doesn't hurt the other party members). A few levels ago, we got a Luck Blade. I convinced the party to let me attune it to myself, and rolled a maximum 3 wishes for the thing. I told the party that 2 wishes would work towards party benefit, but that the last one was mine to use at my discretion. I'm the comic relief character / wild card character (rogue to the max), and have used 2 wishes so far on the party. One was to revive a PC who had to die to kill a Big Bad (PC death was unavoidable if we wanted to pull it off), and another was to reverse time after a catastrophic series of decisions and turn of events that would have hampered our campaign significantly. My rogue was not present when these events when down originally, and although I (in real life) would have stopped my fellow adventurers from doing what they were doing, my lack of physical in-game presence disallowed my dissent. Thus, I feel especially justified in using the final wish for myself. 

With that said, what's an optimal, super duper badass thing a rogue can wish for? I have a broom of flying and a dope ranged weapon (laser gun that casts agnazzar's scorcher). Don't need higher stealth, so invisibility cloak is of no interest.

I'm playing 5e, so the CRs will be a little different than those in the RHoD book (seem lower so far in comparison). This whole thing will be used mainly to calculate a rough ""force multiplier"" of any given unit in RHoD, so that I could say for example that Drellin's Ferry's militia has a force multiplier of (# people)\*(effective CR)=X, and any unit with a force multiplier between, say, 50 to 100 gets a d6 unit size die in S&amp;F Warfare system. (experience and equipment are considered later, as they do not factor as much into ""how many do we have to kill before they run away"")

I've already done quite a bit of scouring the net in search of an answer, which seems to be somewhere between **Cr=level\*25%** for PCs not optimized for battle, to **CR=level\*75%** for optimized PCs, with **higher concentration around 50-66% mark.**

**Prototype**: Currently I'm working with these numbers:

1. CR=level for NPCs with directly war-like classes (fighters, war mages, rangers)
2. CR=level\*50% for NPCs with classes that are useful in, but not concentrated on warfare (rogues, warriors, clerics)
3. CR=level\*25% for NPCs with classes not useful in warfare (commoners, experts, nobles)

0,0,39,5,"Hey all,
I have a question about the paladin class feature Divine Smite. As per recent errata, a 5th level spell slot can now be used to grant the paladin 6d8 radiant damage in divine smite. Alongside that, the “Improved Divine Smite” feature gives a paladin an extra d8 just on every attack. Divine Smite also specifies that any attacks on Fiends or Undead creatures are amplified and you add one more d8. If I were to attack a fiend or undead with a longsword in one hand and use a 5th level Divine Smite whilst at the paladin level necessary to have Improved Divine Smite, would I be dealing 9d8 damage with one attack? Or would it be limited to 7d8 because it only goes as high as 6d8 radiant + 1d8 slashing? Or would it be 8d8, 7d8 radiant and 1d8 slashing because the Improved divine Smite doesn’t count towards the smite total but the extra dice for attacking a fiend does?

The party is facing a horde of kobald who are backed by a red wizard and a black half-dragon. The party mows down the fodder and are left with the wizard and half-dragon. Half the party go after the half-dragon and my monk and the war mage go after the wizard. Half dragon goes down on the same round as the monk successfully uses Stunning Strike on the wizard. Since my monk was last for our round the wizard was up. I'm thinking, he basically has to pass it back to us and let us all get our attacks in at advantage before he can do anything.

The DM picks up the wizard mini and says he magically escapes. I immediately ask how that's possible when he's stunned. DM says it was a 1 word spell to escape. A good 5 minutes of discussing if the wizard can even do that since he's stunned i.e. incapacitated, can't move, speak only falteringly, and yet the wizard still disappears after all of that.

SO, I'm still convinced the wizard was supposed to take a whole round of attacks at disadvantage since I stunned him before he could pull off any attempt at an escape.

For mostly humor related reasons, our wizard has an owl familiar that takes the form of a chicken. The group is certainly looking for a certain goblin-infested castle in the area, and one of my group is suggesting that the wizard simply sends his familiar up 500-600 feet, where his literal birds-eye view would be able to see any ruins, clearings, etc, potentially saving the party a few day's travel to Thundertree to talk to the druid. I fully encourage using the familiar for short-haul dungeon exploring, as the wizard can just use telecommunication up to 100 ft. This sort of hours-long exploration covering an area encompassing a few miles is a harder call. I've got a few days to think this over before our next session. 

Map for reference - party is starting from the village of Phandalin. https://i.imgur.com/RNdM4NM.jpg

In principle, I like the idea, but in application I am wondering how best to handle this. I'm thinking of having the familiar roll a Perception check for every hex explored at a medium DC, and maybe require having it fly closer to get a good look at what it sees, as at that height I assume even a broken down castle would blend in with the rest of the forest?

I'm also aware that natural predators are a thing, so I could do something like roll a d20 per hex explored - on a 17-20, a hawk or other bird of prey would take notice (similar to rolling random encounters on the road). I also am aware that familiars can't attack, so I feel like if I do successfully roll an encounter, it'll be a quick end to the tale of the chicken owl flying above a forest. Maybe that's needed for a touch of realism though. 

Are there limitations to what information the familiar can relate back to the wizard after a successful scouting trip, or other limitations of the familiar for this kind of application? I don't want to make this an overly hard task, because it's a creative use of the relatively limited resources the party has available to them. But I also don't want this to essentially be a dungeon bypass option, as there's a pretty important story tie-in at Thundertree.

I want to make Acid Splash a focus as the cantrip, since it fits thematically. In order to make it viable, It’s going to need a little juicing up (like how the Alchemist gets to add their Intelligence modifier to their Wand Prototype). I’m looking for ideas on how to scale this spell better without making it overpowered.  Here’s some ideas I had:

1. **Damage on save.** A big problem with Acid Splash is that the opponent does not take damage when they save. This feels bad, as a player. It’s less likely to happen to two enemies, but more like to miss at least one and do a measly d6 damage.
2. **Increase damage die.** A d6 is not exciting, even if you can try and tag it onto an extra creature. Larger damage dice could quickly make this spell more imposing. However, it could easily outscale other cantrips if we bump it straight to a d12.
3. **Advantage on damage dice.** Increase the average damage without getting the scaling out of hand.
4. **Add Intelligence modifier to damage dice.** This would scale a little more aggressively than most cantrips (e.g. Fire Bolt) since it can hit twice, but technically Wand Prototype would work just the same way for Acid Splash, so there’s probably no balance concern here.
5. **Just make an entirely new spell.** I'm open to this if it's easier and there's a creative way to make it work.

**QUESTIONS:** Do you have any other ideas? What about secondary effects beyond damage? Which of these do you like best? Is a combination best? What would you like to see combined?

Would be great to hear what you guys think would be useful to pick. I know there are a lot of similar posts already but they generally seemed to be starting at lower levels (or multi-classing) so I wondered if the higher start I'm getting will change any picks.

3. Arcane Ward: It's not as powerful as the first two but this is incredibly useful in combat. With the ability to recharge often, it's useful even in high-level. This one was hard to put here since abjurer is so powerful because the combination of all its useful features (ward+spell resistance+better Counterspell) makes the subclass powerful.

0,0,2,1,"One of my players won't be able to make it to our game night, so I decided to do somewhat of a one-off for the remaining players. For the next game I was thinking about doing a tower-like dungeon crawl where the players will progress from one floor of the tower to another.  

&amp;nbsp;

However, there is one Gotcha, they won't be able to bring in **any** of their items into the tower. The rooms in the floor will comprise of both fighting monsters and puzzles, with the ""Boss Room"" being either a traditional final boss or a Complex Trap (as described in XGE).  

&amp;nbsp;

I know a lot of folks will have a question as to the why's, but the particular part of this that I need help with is how the players can go about obtaining equipment to use within the dungeon. Since the players aren't allowed to bring their equipment this also means they can't bring in their own weapons, armors, or tools. Obviously I could do things such as put in treasure rooms to grant them such items or place enemies that will drop them. However, I also wanted to offer a crafting option. In regards to the time crafting typically takes, I would just chalk it up to ""the magic of the tower accelerates your crafting"" so that players aren't stuck in the tower for days/weeks/years/eternity. The one problem I ran into with that is that, realistically, only one of my players has the necessary proficiency in tools to be able to make items. Even at that, all he could make would be Alchemic potions/solutions or herby-like items.  

&amp;nbsp;

So, there lies the question. How could I open up a quasi-crafting system in the tower so that players can make their own items without essentially giving them the items for free. At most the only thing I could come up with in a Forge of some sort where players could throw in battered items in return for raw materials and t hen turn around to use those raw matierals, or they could in turn throw the raw materials back in a certain combination and get back a finished item. E.G. toss a battered chain mail you looted from an enemy into the forge, and you get some ingots. Then you throw in some ingots with some wood, and you get back an axe, arrows, or some other finished product that comprises of the materials you threw in.",dndnext,Help with Tower Style Dungeon Crawl

&amp;#x200B;

For various reasons I'm thinking of making the next session primarily Theatre of the Mind. One of the reasons is the 3rd dimension will be fairly critical to the area they are running in.

I'm going to use my typical 'playmat' materials to make a scaled version of the whole 'dungeon' - a river running through a canyon, and have them describe how they try to make it through the canyon and what happens using the 'model' to show landmarks etc rather than a scaled battleground.

Why- I want creative solutions and RoC to go through the canyon. There won't be clear trails to follow. In some spots it will be 'impossible' to move forward and I think putting the 'impossible' stuff drawn on to the map will cause more frustration than describing the fact that the river has widened and cut off the ability to walk, so now what do you do? You know what I mean?

I think I already went through every single thread which I could find here and with Google, but did not come up with a concept I like so far.

My campaign is mainly built around retrieving artefacts, which are needed to prevent the villain from doing some bad stuff (classic, I know). Every artefact is found at the end of a dungeon, and for the next one I chose the place of an underground abandoned city. No one can be found, the city is average size; when players walk around, they will find a small iron golem, who is blacksmithing and can communicate with them. He is quite friendly and tries to sell stuff. He complains about lack of business during the last time, acting like it is completely normal to be blacksmithing in a city in which he is the last... Moving thing. He seems to be created by his former master, who turns out to be the former blacksmith in town; this is revealed when players want to go into detail.

Now the part with which I need help: I need some kind of riddle or task which players have to fulfill which reveals the final position of the artefact. It can include encounters, but should not be the only element, as my group is quite into riddles (not like the classic rhymes or sphinx riddles, rather some investigation stuff or trial and error riddles). I already thought of plenty different scenarios: something like probably the last wishes from deceased people must me fulfilled, with who they communicate after the golem sold them an item for that purpose. Or an item on a fountain in the very middle of the city is obviously missing und must be put back.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm beginning to DM a homebrew adventure and I want to make custom items for my characters based on their expectations to each one.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in 3.5e old times, I liked the concept of ""Legacy Items"" and ""Item Sets"" and I want your help to create something like that. For those not familiarized with these types of magic items, ""Legacy Items"" are powerful items that level up with characters and need a talent to up to the next tier, but despite being powerful, they gave some kind of debuff, like a -1 in something (in 3.5e is normally in a saving throw or skill, or even in an attack bonus). The talent sometimes accompanies a quest and some sort of ritual (I will use only the quest/ritual part and they will be mandatory). The ""Items Sets"" are the classical sets of many games, where having more than one item of the collection start to give you bonuses.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my first idea is to make ""armor sets of legacy"". Items with the capability to improve their quality (in terms of power and utility) and provide bonuses if you find more of the same collection. Simple, no? The players not necessarily will be able to get all of them neither unlock all the potential of the items. Because of this, I'm not concerned (at least not for now) if the whole thing is OP or some items are OP.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to ask your help with the first character I'm working on: a Wood Elf Ranger who want to use the Gloom Stalker/Assassin/Battle Master build. He inspired himself with the Bosmer race from Elder Scrolls and want to be the best hunter in the world and uses ambush tactics. He fights in long range with bows.

&amp;#x200B;

So I want your help to create all items in this concept. I will try to make at least one item for every slot (weapon, head, shoulder, armor, bracer/glove, ring, neck, boots, waist, some other misc item as a quiver, for example). The concept for these items, besides fit on the above build, is to have a heavy ""forest/animal"" theme and don't use wood as materials unless the wood is alive (the bosmer have a pact with a nature good that forbidden them to hurt any kind of plant life). The items maybe were created by their hunt god or even their creator god. You get the idea.

Hey guys, I made [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b46sti/about_to_start_our_last_session/) two days ago about the end of my campaign. I said that I would talk about it if there was interest. There was some interest and so now I am talking about it. I might to post this yesterday, but had some issues with the automod. I have another game to run in couple hours, but I'm happy to talk about anything until then.

I am happy to answer questions about the game, what I learned, my homebrew rules, or anything else! Some of the players will be here as well.

**The Game**

We were playing my own modified version of 5e. We started in November of 2017 and I think we had around 70 sessions. I used group XP. The game is a bit harder on the players, but nothing too brutal (the players may disagree). We used Matt Colville's [Warfare](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/) rules along with quite a bit of homebrew stuff from my end.

There were 6 players (one of them online with Roll20 and Skype), myself, and one player who only made the game when school wasn't going on.

**The Players**

We are all pretty inexperienced and I believe everyone but Paladin 1 is the only player who did not have a character die. Only one player has had two deaths. We started with six players, added two and lost one.

DM: I have the most experience with DnD 5e, but not much. I've DM a whole lot of one on one stuff with my girlfriend and one 1 to 11 roll20 game, but that's it.

Barbarian: Not sure how much experience he has with RPG's or 5e. He is the oldest character in terms of character life.

Wizard: The only player with no experience with RPG's. This was also his second character. His character is the second oldest. He was a necromancer who casted fireball a lot. He is the second oldest.

Warlock: My girlfriend the second most experienced . She was playing a fey warlock after her ranger died. She might be in the thread. She was only player who played online. Her character is the third oldest.

 

Bard: A lore bard who has been given some gifts from the God of Chaos. This was his second character after his warlock died. We played a few sessions together in a game ran by my girlfriend's dad. His character is the fourth oldest

Rogue: I don't know how much experience he has with 5e or RPG's. He played a swashbuckler (when he could make it) and had two characters die.

Paladin 1: This player joined last and is the only player to have no deaths. I believe he has the most experience. He played an Oath of the Ancients Paladin. He will be answering questions.

Paladin 2: This player join before the first paladin, but took a break for school. His had two characters before this one, but only one died. He was involved in the game with Bard, Girlfriend and myself. I don't know how much experience he has.

**The Story**

The general story was that a divide between a group of orcs. Some were following a servant of Orcus while others were following the true orc gods. This divide happened after all of the orcs invaded the humans. The party were placed in a three way war and had to pick sides. They ended up fighting with the humans and ""good"" orcs. While this made the fight easier, orcs now are in a position of power in the land. There were other smaller plots, but that was the main arch. The story started as the backdrop for levels 1-5 and then became the main focus. The end of the game saw Orcus killed in this lair along with my own version of the Raven Queen being freed from her prison inside one of the players weapons.

**Things I liked**

One things I really liked about the game was that I was able to avoided any fudging. I find the game less fun if I fudge things, so I tried really hard to avoid it. The closest I came was making a few favorable ruling at a good time and changing a homebrew monsters on the fly if after I saw them in action.

I also liked and encourage all DMs to do this, make the players choice matter. There are quite a few consequences of this game that will effect my other games going forward. I felt like the world changed based on the players.

 

**Things I learned**

Having too many players is better than not enough. I think we missed two to eight sessions total. This was mainly because if a few players couldn't make it, we could still play. I think it is best to have 5-6.

While having a player ""call in"" is tough, it is doable. I've been on the wrong side of that situation and it didn't work well at all, but if you are able to spend enough time (and like $30) you can get an okay set-up.

It is okay to take a break. There was a time where I wanted to take a break so that a critical session would line up with a school break so everyone could be there. One thing I did was have another player DM a mini campaign for a few weeks. I was afraid this would cause people to be less interested, but that didn't happen. There was also a time I had to take a break mid session after something crazy happened. It felt weird to do, but it worked out okay.

From a game design point of view, I found the end game monster to be fine, but that there very few rules and situations that challenged the players in non combat ways. In the lower levels you can use things like money, food/water, and distance to put the placers in difficult situations. The only thing like that I found for higher level play were different planes of existence, but even that was not perfect.

**Lastly, here is an art piece I got commission for the the game. I hope you enjoy!**

0,0,7,3,"To get this out of the way: yes I understand Eberron is supposed to be ""higher magic"" and ""stronger"" than other dnd settings so the racials should be ""stronger."" I get it, I don't agree with it on concept, but I get it. That's not the issue I'm addressing with this post, however.

&amp;#x200B;

So, usually with regards to the eberron races the thing I usually see talked to death is warforged AC and the like. However I want to point out two things that kind of worry me with regards to A. playing a character who exists in Eberron, and B. future subrace/race design for Wizards going forward. And those two things are that the Swiftstride Shifter and Kalashtar both share a racial trait that is either nearly exactly the same, or objectively better than the class features of Scout Rogue and GoO Warlock, respectively. To compare them directly:  


Shifter trait:  Whiled shifted, (walking speed increase), Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Scout Rogue 3rd level feature: You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, the features are nearly identical, with the Scout rogue's being slightly better in that it is half your speed rather than a flat 10 feet. It also does not have the requirement of being shifted. My biggest issue with this one is it puts you in a very difficult spot if you want to play a shifter rogue. The Swiftstride Shifter is the one that gets +2 to dex, something very desirable for a rogue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Khalastar Racial Trait: (Mind Link) You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 ft of you. You dont' need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself. As a bonus action when you're speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and be able to see you.

&amp;#x200B;

GoO Warlock Feature: (Awakened Mind) You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. 

&amp;#x200B;

This one is the biggest offender and also the saddest if you're a warlock. Not only does the Khalastar ability have double the possible range, it has the added ""Or if the creature is telepathic itself"" for understand, AND as a bonus action the creature can respond to you, unlike the Warlock option where it would be impossible for the creature to respond. I understand that there are flavor differences between the two abilities but it's a really big discrepancy. It becomes rather limiting in an un-fun way when the combination of class/race that you want to play has overlapping abilities, or even when your class ability is overshadowed by a racial one. I'm worried that in future prints and designs we'll see more either improved or watered down versions of class abilities that creates too much overlap with no alternatives. I'm not sure if the better solution would be to offer some alternatives if you already have a similar class feature ( like with background profiencies?) or to alter them hugely. They both feel strong flavor wise for the races, but the repeated nature of them doesn't sit right with me. Obviously Wgte is still in development phase so this may change in the future.

obviously my CHA is my dumpstat right now but I have some idea or hope my DM might be able to hear me out because I'm a newbie player and wasn't quite aware of what I was doing when I started and always kind of had this build in mind. SO! my question is this: Should I bother with going into Warlock if I can manage to convince my DM to switch my INT to my CHA? I'm not playing to be super OP but I would like to remain formidable and be able to attack a whole bunch / defend my party. Going into Warlock would definitely fit into the story line as well as going Hexblade since I just 'found' a +2 nightmare glaive that could introduce me into the class further. I have a hard time though understanding how this will go long term or if it will severely stunt me by the time I get to higher levels.  I want to get to fighter Level 6 at least for my next feat

&amp;#x200B;

I guess there is a few options: To just 'dip' into level 1 warlock, or would it be a good idea to take more levels in it? Should I even bother? With Hexblade you get a few cool things: Baleful curse which increases critical hit range. It also gets me Hex as a spell, and Eldritch blast cantrip as well as green flame blade cantrip. I was pretty unimpressed by the wizards spell lists honestly

or will I be severely weakened by 20th level by dipping?

-character reasons! The world I'm in has 6 massive ""Titans"", great legendary beasts that my character is fascinated with

Sometime later when the group has brought back the body of Sebastien to Waterdeep a funeral is held on a bright beautiful and sunny day on the shores of Waterdeep  and words to this effect are said by a cleric of Kelemvor: Sebastien was a man who loved many but was hated by everyone. Sebastien was a man who was cursed by the gods from his very birth. He was given up for adoption at birth. He lived off the streets and went to the school of hard knocks. As a young man he tried his luck at being a bounty hunter but the act of being an undercover law man got him into a rough crowd and his childhood came back to him. He got into drugs, prostitution, thievery, unholy rituals and  every form of debauchery. Sebastien didn't come into life with much and it's unfortunate how many with little get pulled down into this by the influences around him. Sebastien struck many deals with dark powers that ultimately caused him suffering. His drug habits, sex, habits and more ultimately destroyed him. By the time of his death Sebstien was lost to this world seeking any shred of happiness and power he could find in his dark desires. A man of strong drink, it was rare to find him sober or not using illicit drugs. He sought to escape his existence in all forms. His dark world put everything he cared about at risk but Sebastien was not universally hated. He did take under his tutelage a Bryce Halfheart who he tried to protect from his dark side. Bryce had this to say about him ""he was a true friend. He and his friends saved my life and I will owe him my life as long as live. Thank you Sebastien for who you were in life and having been a big brother who looked out for me.""

My question is this: Does Arcane Armament let you make a nonmagical attack with a magical weapon twice?

I am a DM running a game where one  of the players is playing a revised artificer. We have both read the Arcane Armament feature thoroughly and discussed what its definition is. I say that it only affects magical attacks from magical weapons, and he says it affects all attacks from magical weapons. My logic is that if, say, a battleaxe with the power to cast a single ray of scorching ray was found, the artificer could make one battleaxe attack, two scorching ray attacks, or one of each. He would not be able to make two battleaxe attacks. My player believes otherwise.

Here is a handy chart to compare:

Artifact gauntlet- has 3 charges, 1 charge fires a beam for 2d6 force damage.Both of us agree that an artificer can make two attacks with this weapon.

Flaming Battleaxe- has no charges, instead passively deals 1d4 fire damage with every hitI say that an artificer cannot make two attacks with this weapon. He says it can.

The second means missing out on one ASI, get up to a 7th level spell slot, all my Necromancer abilities, a Pact Boon, three Invocations and another Patron feature which would likely be Defy Death in this case.

Due to the dm's plans for the area we've decided that the circle she's from practices magic from the circle of land (Coast). I've got a few other bullet points for her details and Ideas I had that I need to work around:

* She felt at odds with her circle because of her closer affinity for animals and plants vs theirs for more weather and elemental magics.
* She doesn't know her father (He was the genasi in her bloodline) but her mother tells her he was a captain of a ship. 
* She's never been outside of the area where she lives, so she's excitable and prone to wandering out of curiosity. 
* Extremely social and friendly to a fault, has a poor set of social skills because she's only ever been around people who are related to her or know her already because of the close-knit structure of her circle/tribe.

2. conjurer: RP-wise, it's my favorite since I've always loved wizards that conjure up creatures and fireballs from the sky. It actually feels like I'm playing some battlemage also as I summon and teleport around (it's not THAT good of a summoner until level 10 IMHO though).

Sure enough, one of my players has been infected, so I've gone to the trouble of typing the whole thing up and making it official.

0,0,9,1,"So I am currently playing a swashbuckler in a new campaign. I am at level 3 and should be level 4 relatively soon. The archtypical swashbuckler is of course the dual wielding rapier but I want a bit more fun in my build while still being able to assist with dps. My party is a Glamour Bard, Moon Druid, and Conquest Paladin. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next level I plan on taking wizard to pick up booming blade, create bonfire, find familiar and shield along with utility rituals. At level 5 I plan on taking fighter to get shield proficiency and defense fighting style. So at level 5 I will have an AC of 20 (technically 21 since I have masterwork studded leather) and be able to turn 1 ignite my bonfire in an area the paladin and I are going to control. The remaining turns I booming blade with advantage from my familiar to help me hit since I'm only making 1 attack per round then try to either force the enemy to move closer to me to activate booming blade or enter my bonfire to attack either the paladin or I. So in a perfect world where my bonfire hits I'm doing 2d8 from the rapier hit, 2d6 sneak attack, 2d8 for activating booming blade, and 2d8 from bonfire for 6d8+2d6+5. Since triggering both booming blade and bonfire may be difficult lets assume its only 4d8+2d6+5 for an average of 29-31 damage. The normal level 5 swashbuckler dual wielding gets 2d8+3d6+10 damage for 30-32 damage assuming both hit.

So while not sacrificing damage to any notable extent I will have a higher AC (18 for the typical level 5 swashbuckler with dual wielder feat), have the utility of detect magic, identify, and other spells, and can have much more fun in combat trying to move people around with my shield master paladin to trigger BB or push them into the bonfire. Additionally, if the tactic of bonfire and BB both hit I'm doing significantly more damage than the vanilla swashbuckler.

Am i missing an obviously better option? The other feasible choices are a hexblade 1 instead of 1wizard/1 fighter to grant a lot of the same benefits but I think its slightly less optimal for what I'm looking for. I could also choose dueling fighting and increase my average dame to barely above the normal level 5 swashbuckler, but tanking with high AC, shield, and eventually uncanny dodge at level 6 is a bit more of a priority.

0,0,44,1,"It's getting to be about the time in 5E's lifespan where Wizards has enough data about how people are playing the edition that the designers might want to start putting together a revised ruleset. What additions or tweaks would you most like to see?

Personally, the two areas I would most like to see worked on:

1) Especially after the success of Critical Role, the emphasis in 5E has moved out of the combat arena and into more narrative-first spaces. That's great! However a vast majority of the mechanics in the RAW define your character around combat, with the handful of exceptions being  just that, exceptions, and not core parts of the game. Now some would say that this is the land of RP and should stay that way ... but I would love some more mechanical options built into, say, an how an argument works, or searching for a rumor, or pulling off a hustle, than just defaulting on very simple skill checks.

2) Since the very start, D&amp;D has struggled with the fact that the difference between ""that last combat was a joke"" and ""TPK"" is perhaps a bit too narrow. This is doubly an issue in 5E, where, far more so than in previous editions, the types of games people run shy away from character death. I would love for there to be more mechanical options in the RAW for major permanent setbacks for PCs that aren't character death.

NOTE: Of COURSE you can homebrew all of this stuff. Or call it at the table. This is about what you want to see integrated into the RAW and designed by professional game designers who have a team of playtesters to make sure it's fun/balanced.

 \- Do I just pick right back up and remove her character wholesale, pretending she was never there? That doesn't seem right.

 \- Do I have the enemies they're fighting (a trio of night hags \[we're running an altered CoS\]) kill her barbarian during the battle? Maybe right at the beginning? But then who controls the barbarian until she dies? I'm also not sure making the PCs deal with this death both in *and* out of character is the best solution.

 \- Do I have her character leave the party? There's no real catalyst for such a thing, so it'd feel fake.

 \- Do I keep her barbarian traveling with the party until the end of the campaign? I'm not relishing controlling 2 NPCs \[they've got Esmeralda with them atm\] plus all the enemies and everyone else they interact with as well. Plus we don't have her character sheet, so I'd be guessing on almost everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not sure where to go with this. Any and all advice would be great.

Edit:

Wow, this is my most popular post on reddit by far. Which I suppose is both good and bad in this situation. Thank you to everyone that has expressed their thoughts, ideas, and, most especially, condolences.

I'll be reaching out to my group this weekend with some of the ideas y'all suggested, and giving them time to mull them over before we meet on Thursday and discuss them in person.

When I first joined reddit I had no idea how great of a community it was. This post has made me glad I came here to ask this question, and I'm thankful you've all given your responses with the gravitas and respect I think it deserved. 

From both me and my players, thank you again.


Edit2:
Met with my group tonight to play some board games and present some options suggested here. The general consensus is that while we'd all be fine with just dropping the campaign as a whole, our friend wouldn't want us to do that. As another party member put it, she'd think it was bullshit she died and bullshit that we stopped playing because of it.

Most of them were uncomfortable with the idea of eulogizing in character, but they also didn't want to pretend like nothing had happened. After another week to process, we decided to do what was probably the most popular suggestion here: skip the battle and narrate the afterwards, with the PC's character having died in the fray. If any characters want to comment on it they'll have a chance to do so, but otherwise we'll just move on.

Unless there's a huge request for it, I probably won't update this post again. Thanks to all y'all for the advice and condolences. ",dndnext,"PC Passed Away, What About Her Character?"

==========

Magical Tinkering
At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic in objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, or other artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.

The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.

A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

I really enjoy learning about them and people's experiences with them from every time period, a region of the world, or whatever else. It's just so fascinating and scary how both fragile and incredibly strong the brain/mind can be. So because of that I enjoy sprinkling them into parts of the games I DM. It's not every session or very often, just little bits of it to ad more ""life"" to the world. And considering all the terrifying shit in the DnD universe there has to be something, right? 

Next session my players are going to be going to a [castle on an island](https://pin.it/xjqjxq5ufhhait) surrounded by a large wall in a lake. They've already run into a small hunting party that was heading back to town with their kills. The hunters told the party about the area and how nobody really goes there anymore because there are howls and screams from animals that should not live in the type of climate their in. The player's interest in the areas is piqued. So here's what I'm planning. 

The castle is a caregiving and safe haven for elder druids that are in any stage of dementia and/or Alzheimer's. The area has been watched over by a clan of Wood Elves that...live in the woods. The local villages always give praise and all that to druids so they are always revered and protected, that's where this castle comes in. When the other Druids notice the signs they bring them to the castle so that they aren't a harm to themselves or others. 

With the illness they start to wild shape into animals on accident, sometimes they mess up the wild shape and turn into a goad that screeches like a hawk, or bear that acts like a cat, or whatever weird mixture of animals you can think of. And I know that's not how wild shape works but whatever. They also wild shape into animals that are higher than CR 1. Like an elephant, T-Rex, etc. And of course, they can also cast spells just to make it more interesting. 

The party will find out about one of the ""residents"" that knows where some great weapon that he stole from a god (...or demon lord...or something, that's still in the works) is hidden. With the power of magic I'm going to have them go inside the dudes mind à la [Psychonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonauts#Setting), [Inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception), [Being John Malkovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_John_Malkovich), [Total Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_(1990_film)#Plot), [The Butterfly Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect), [Paprika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(2006_film)#Plot), [Perfect Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Blue), [Roy: A Life Well Lived](https://youtu.be/szzVlQ653as?t=24), of course the [The Inner Light TNG episdoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inner_Light_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)), and a few books. And have them try to play through the experience of someone with dementia/Alzheimer's lives and thinks. I got that idea from this great short flash game called [Alz](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905). 

I'm going to give them random premade character sheets that are at varying levels and have them play through previous battles that the Druid and his adventuring party went through. Some of the character sheets will have things blacked out like class abilities, to hit and damage dice, etc to add confusion and frustration. The character sheets are different styles that I've found on this subreddit to further make things confusing and frustrating. Also through life experiences that they had with roleplaying aspects, like seeing their child, spouse, or family member but not being able to remember their face, name, the sound of their voice, or combinations of all three. Flashbacks to happy days and sad, etc. 

I have other mental illness ideas and I'd like to get get some more inspiration from what you guys have used in your games or want to use. 

So what do you all have?

And yes, my table is very ok with these types of topics being played out and discussed and are also ok with the frustrating acts of roleplaying. They're very into being made to feel something both in and out of the game. From actual crying to real life anger (not at me), and crying from happiness. 

And of course, my games aren't always serious e.g. a bear trap that is literally a trap that drops bears on you or being sent into an Orc cave to rescue a farmers kid who was taken but the kid turns out to be a baby goat, and stuff like that.

0,0,10,0,"I decided to run a One-shot yesterday as a break for our regular campaign and decided to do something special for my players. I converted some of their old characters in unfinished campaigns to LV 6 characters to make a sorta ""last ride"" adventure with them. I did this because one of my players is leaving for a couple of months and I wanted his last session to be a cool one.  
&amp;nbsp;


My players were a Dragonborn Paladin (the friend I mentioned earlier), a Dragonborn Barbarian and a Bard Monkey with Halfling stats. The PCs met in a tavern before Gnolls broke in and started attacking. During the fight the Paladin player is joking about hitting the Gnolls while he was actually trying to kill the Monkey (do keep in mind that he wasn't actually trying to hurt him). The Monkey player is being a good sport about it and even follows up the banter by acting scared in a comedic way.  
&amp;nbsp;

The encounter ends, players receive instructions from an NPC that they will sail to the Gnoll's hideout in the morning. The encounter left the Monkey Bard in pretty bad shape and the Barbarian says a couple of times that they should put him out of his misery but not actually doing it (his PC is LE). Paladin and Barbarian players start playing up the roleplay and animosity between them since they are a metallic and a chromatic dragonborn respectively. They start a brawl while the Monkey player tries to stop them by getting into the fray. They were having a ton of fun with this extremely cartoonish fight. They were failing to grapple each other, hitting each other with the Monkey, failing spell attacks in a ridiculously small space, Barbarian summons a moose, the whole package.  
&amp;nbsp;


So the Monkey downs the Paladin and I ask him if he is hitting to knock him unconscious but he says he is hitting to kill. I get weirded out by this but I am not one to just take my player's agency away so I let it happen. Paladin goes into negatives and starts the Death Saving throws.  
&amp;nbsp;

Barbarian player instructs his Moose animal companion to attack the downed Paladin and I ask him if he knows he is going to insta kill him with that. Barbarian player gets a really scared look on his face and corrects himself saying that he just wants to rough the Paladin around a little bit, not actually kill him. Monkey's turn comes up and he just straight up kills the Paladin and then downs the Barbarian before killing him and then looting their bodies.  
&amp;nbsp;

Paladin and Barbarian players aren't mad, just shocked. Monkey's player is super into it, telling us how his character has ""always been a motherfucker"" and that's something he would do. Monkey's player tells us if we want to reset before the fight or make new PCs but I didn't feel like going on to be honest. I think that D&amp;D isn't about winning as much as it is about having fun, and you can't have fun in a one-shot with dead characters.  
&amp;nbsp;

What left a really sour taste in my mouth is that this One-shot was specially about characters that the players were fond-of making a comeback, but now is going to be ""that session were a couple of up characters straight up died like a bitch"".  
&amp;nbsp;

In hindsight I probablly should've told the dragonborn players to knock-off the teasing of the Monkey but I don't think it was even about the teasing for him. The vibe he gave me was that he just wanted to kill their PCs because he found it hilarious.  
&amp;nbsp;

Am I right for being upset? Should I mention something to him or the other players? He hasn't been disruptive before and I don't want to blow this out of proportion, but I feel that it could become a problem if I don't address it. What should I do?

You can't scrap death either because the game isn't made for undying PCs. And death is still a very important theme in the game, and extremely interesting story-wise. Well, it would be if it wasn't the end of the story for at least one character. 

So, how to keep death in the game but not have your PCs dying? Of course while still having a difficult campaign.

I came up with an idea for my asia-themed campaign, mostly inspired by samurai honor and modern occidental tales about Asian heroes.

When a character dies (by failing three death saves or by any other mean), ask the player if he prefers to be crippled instead. Depending on the damage that killed him, he know has a permanent disability like a missing arm or a crooked leg. The character gets to still have a story going on, and now has a new motivation : getting over his wound. Maybe he seeks out a very skilled watchmaker to craft him a mechanical arm, or a powerful cleric to cast regeneration on him.

""At 9th Level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.""

Point of contention seemed to revolve around whether or not a character stops moving at the end of their turn. I'm not opening that particular can of worms again, but in the course of reading through it all and checking out Sage Advice's [ruling](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2018/04/07/__trashed-14/) plus [Mike Mearls'](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/12/20/can-a-lv9-monk-use-unarmored-movement-to-run-non-stop-through-a-large-lake-without-falling/), rules seem pretty clear on it. RAW says no, but the book ain't the DM.

Honestly, monks naruto-running on stuff sounds neat, so I thought of a compromise and figured i might share it.

For starters: Ki is weird. It's not strictly magic per se, but it can produce similar effects. For example:

 * Give you fists of fury (Flurry of Blows)

 * make you harder to hit (Patient Defense)

 * go zoom (Step of the Wind)

 * catch arrows and throw em back (Deflect Missile)

 * fall from great height and land like cat (Slow Fall)

 * stun people (Stunning Strike)

 * punch ghosts (Ki-Empowered Strikes)

 * reroll saves (Diamond Soul)

 * be a sprint grandma (Timeless Body)

 * become ghost (Empty Body)

 * Instantly kill the Big Bad Final Boss (Quivering Palm)

 * stealth spells (Shadow Arts)

 * Conjure earth/wind/fire/water/ice/whatever like the Avatar (Elemental Disciplines)

 * fight better when drunk (anything in Drunken Master)

 * make an ordinary stick a +3 magic weapon (One with the Blade + Sharpen the Blade) 

 * Shoot tiny sun balls from your hands (Radiant Sun Bolt)

 * tank an ancient red dragon's full multiattack with 1 hit point and stay standing (Mastery of Death)

And that's just the stuff you spend Ki Points to do, i'm not counting the rest of the clearly supernatural things Monks can do.

Establishing that Ki is a mysterious force, we come, finally, to the point:

By 9th Level, most spellcasters have had access to spells like Spider Climb and Water Walk for several levels, and have just attained Fly. The key (ki) difference is that they have to expend their precious resources to accomplish any of these.

Following that logic, most of the Monk's supernatural abilities require Ki to perform, and walking on water or running vertically is definitely supernatural. 

Thus, if you, the DM, have a 9th level Monk in your party, who came to the session wearing their Hidden Leaf headband and a face full of hope, I propose the following:

Just have them use Step of the Wind to continue adhering to the wall/not sinking. Costs Ki to use, can't do it forever, uses their bonus action, makes sense. 

At least I think so anyway. A potentially easier solution to bringing about your epic Kingdom Hearts 2 running-across-flying-buildings final fight is to just give them magic flip-flops that let them do what they're trying to do.  Idk its your game do what you want &lt;3

(EDIT)

To clarify just in case, the problem with the ability is that it implies a Monk attempting to move up/across a vertical surface or over a body of liquid would fall/sink if they stopped moving, or at the end of their turn. 

Monks can move fast enough that in most cases this isn't really a huge problem, but I think if a monk wants to be spiderman or have an epic on-top-of-the-water fight, then that's awesome and I'm down, but I might ask them to use Step of the Wind as part of their movement to avoid falling or sinking, implying that their use of Ki is enabling them to continue sticking to walls/standing on water. 

If you as DM, or the DM at your table, would let the Monk do this for free, then that's wicked.

Little by little, I have been working on a Drow character.  This character was born the son of human wizard and a drow girl, whom the wizard had held in captivity since her childhood.

Valor bards get shields where Swords don't.  But Swords can use BI to raise their AC for a round.  So Swords can regularly have better AC than valor.  The AC change let's valor get the best AC but only against individual attacks - so they are the toughest bards.

The half proficiency to saves and ability to use a BI on a save makes the valor bard tougher and also makes them much better at maintaining concentration.  Since many bard spells use concentration, this is a big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in search of fellow theory crafters.  Crafting new characters and backgrounds is one of my favorite parts of DnD.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, I have found great value in Dexterity.  It should be noted that I played a Rogue and a Wizard.

&amp;#x200B;

I have enjoyed making builds for other classes, and always had a hard time getting away from a high initiative, or whatever your obsession with Dexterity may originate from.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I tried my hardest to simply ""find a viable strength build""  where I don't have to get crazy unrealistic ""god rolls"" on a character sheet in order to make the character build viable.

&amp;#x200B;

So here it is.  My Paladin.  As I share this character with you all, I am no longer a special snowflake.  If this build becomes popular, it will be bittersweet.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, we're not playing Lawful Stupid, or Deus Vult, or ""Morality Police"" of the group.  Get a backstory.  Make it interesting.  Further still, choose a Deity.  Choose one of the neutral gods, so you have good reason to be morally gray?

&amp;#x200B;

This Character builds attempts to maximize the use of our Bonus Action, Reaction, Opportunity Attacks, and effectively make the most out of our turn economy.  (I used to be a rogue, so it's very hard for me to let go of Cunning Action).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that Great Weapon Master is the greatest Feat in the game.

\-From a thematic perspective, I have never appreciated dual wielding.  not lightsabers, maybe daggers, maybe the one sword, one dagger.   I just find it more badass to be wielding something 2 handed.  even if it's a longsword + shield character and you use the versatile feat with the longsword, I think that's badass!  

\-Anyways... Great Weapon Master let's you wield a Greatsword, the coolest weapon in the game.  (ask DM to use D12 instead of 2D6's.... if you want.  basically for looks.  D12's are much prettier, and have faster rate of play!).

&amp;#x200B;

\-You will always be doing a strong attack, with the ability granted by the GWM feat to -5 to hit for a +10 DMG.   think I'm joking?  nope... you will always strong attack.  

&amp;#x200B;

\-This solves a major complaint that many people have about the paladin, being ""can't kill hordes"".  watch me.

&amp;#x200B;

By this time a lot of you are saying ""Ok this guy is dumb, he just wants me to hit things hard? wow"".  But hear me out!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Paladin: Oath of Devotion.  The lvl 3 ability makes our weapon magical for  1 Minute (a full combat encounter?) and adds our Charisma to the attack roll.  also shedding light and cool shit, because Paladin.  Hopefully we have a decent charisma, because this is gold, Jerry!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Defense for the +1 AC or go GWF to reroll 1's and 2's.   but remember.... our dmg is already coming from the huge +10 chunks!  Choose whatever you want.  of these two.  and only these two.  Baka\~

&amp;#x200B;

""But can't I do all of this as a fighter, without having to worry about all of that Deity stuff?""

\-Short answer?  Shame on you!  a pox upon your house!

\-Longer Answer?  Will you happen to have a cleric in your party that can be guaranteed to always have Bless on you?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Brothers, Sisters, don't fucking stop using Bless.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If I have stats with 18 STR and 18 CHA  (Lucky, but not impossible.  a lot of DM's let you roll until you find a stat combination you enjoy.  

\-using sacred weapon, I have +8 to hit, + proficiency bonus.

\-include Bless to get an additional 1-4 to hit.

&amp;#x200B;

If you get to this point, you're looking at a minimum bonus to hit of +11.  I would say that it's now prudent to use the -5 to hit for a +10 to damage.

\-This helps you proc the ""when you take an enemy down to 0HP you can make a single attack as a Bonus Action"".

&amp;#x200B;

As this character progresses, give them the sentinel feat, and plant them right in the action.  you now have increased use of your reactions and opportunity attacks.  greater turn economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you are truly concerned about your mobility and being able to ""get to the fight"", I did originally create this character to be a Tabaxi.  Brothers, Sisters, you will need to truly be fearless to play a tabaxi amongst our nerd brethren who call any Tabaxi a Furry. 

&amp;#x200B;

but the Tabaxi double movement ability could synergize very well with this paladin, especially if you are able to use Sentinel.  tabaxi run up to 3 NPC's who didn't think you'd be that fast... if they try to run away, sentinel feat one of them, hopefully the biggest baddy of the group.  then spend your following turn attacking them.  but don't move!  you don't have to.  aaaaand now you have recharged your feline agility or whatever it's called.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is a Strength Character that will have greater AC that Dex characters.... unless you count Wizards as Dex characters....

&amp;#x200B;

Wizards have the highest possible AC.  with:

\-Base of 15 with 20 Dex

\-Archmagi robes for 15+Dex

\-Bracers of Defense for +2AC

\-Ring of Protection for +1AC

\-Cloak of Protection for +1AC

&amp;#x200B;

for a total of 24 AC.  Also, if it's a level 18 Wizard, then they can permanently use Shield for free, for an added +5AC at the cost of their reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

but just comparing STR vs DEX, strength actually has the advantage.  hopefully you don't drown in your armor.  (oh hey that's part of my characters tragic backstory... nooo....)

&amp;#x200B;

Strength has higher DMG that Dexterity.  this where GWM really separates itself from Sharpshooter.  If sharpshooter let me attack another target on kill or crit, then I would say dexterity is better.  but this one Feat, really shows where the designers put their foot in the ground for what melee fighters risk by being in the fray.

&amp;#x200B;

my solid +10 dmg chunks from GWM are better than your sneak attack dice.  and I'm doing multiple attacks a around!  possibly 4 attacks in one full round of combat!  hahaha, ohhh rogues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Strength has higher AC, higher DMG, at the loss of not being able to sneak around or pickpocket?  hahahahahhahahahaha.  child's play.

This is a tool to automate damage calculations for large number of creatures. 
You give the target AC, number of creatures attacking, and attack statistics, 
it returns the damage dealt to the target by rolling the dice. You can also select an
SRD monster's attack or an ""Animate Objects"" object size so fields can be filled automatically.
That SRD monster selection box allows for searching so no need to scroll all the way down to find 
your monster.

Your damage description can be more complex than a simple ""XdY"". 
The format is explained [here](https://github.com/oganm/diceSyntax/blob/master/README.md).
For instance, if your enemies have great weapon fighting, you can do something like ""2d6ro&lt;2"".

It supports up to 1000 creatures. If you really need more than that send your PCs my regards.
If you are an R user, it's trivial to install it locally and remove that limitation.
I can help out if needed.

In the future I might return an average damage for massive mob sizes since randomness start 
mattering less and less as the number goes up. I also want to make it possible for everyone 
to install it on their own machines easily but my previous way of doing so hasn't been working
very well and I never had the time to fix that.

Honestly I'm surprised I couldn't find something like this out there. 
The closest were [this](http://onebitcpu.mygamesonline.org/animateobject.html)
by /u/onebitcpu specifically for animate objects and [this](http://slyflourish.com/mob_calculator.html)
that returns an average damage.

**Why this?** I like the idea of having large number of weaker creatures in D&amp;D. Action economy and
bounded accuracy means even low level enemies can stay dangerous in large numbers. Having large
number of enemies is a good way to challenge certain PCs (eg. weapon attack focused characters)
and forcing them to make strategic choices about PC placement, reaction use potentially using things
like skill checks to control the battlefield instead of regular attacks. Remind them those muscles
are also good for knocking rocks on a pathway. Any AOE focused
character will have a field day but they will also more be vulnerable since their AC probably doesn't scale as well as the fighter's and they can get overwhelmed easily. Forcing them to rely on their friends for protection and choose between dealing damage or battlefield control.

**Why not use a variant rule or an average?** Ultimately randomness is
part of the rules. If you know how much damage you take when the enemy acts in a certain way,
it removes part of the game that normally makes decision making more interesting/stressful. Randomness and
knowing the number of hits and misses also give more opportunities for narrative diversification. For
a PC it is satisfying/frustrating to know how well their defensive measures worked out. Also I feel like most DMs don't bother with calculating an average anyway. It is still more math than having a big dude on the field.",dndnext,D&amp;D swarm simulator

Sometimes changing the list of prepared spells is very important, but can take a solid 5 minutes of dedicated thinking. The role playing however typically demands my attention immediately after finishing a long rest. I don't want to 'slow down' the game by asking people to wait, and I don't want to shed my responsibility by just picking last days spells to be the next days' spells.

General solution idea: Do this thinking throughout the current day, and have it easily swappable when a long rest is finished.

My failed solution: I tried changing my spell list for the next day by changing my current spell list and just remembering which i switched. But then an unexpected encounter showed up and the session ended before resolving it. So my list of prepared spells is a mix of current and next day spells. And technically illegal to swap spells during the day. And it is hard to remember weeks back what spells were changed.

Looking for some advice without loosing too much Karma, if possible.

It is a fact that Ability Scores are useless in DnD rules, all that matters is the Ability Modifier.

I would like in my game to make Ability Scores meaningful again, because I love them. When creating a new character, when I write ""16"" or ""9"" on my character sheet I want to use this number when rolling dice.

&amp;#x200B;

One old idea is to make ability check rolls under Ability Score for a success, and compare the margin with a new scale giving the quality of the success, the DC becoming the minimum quality threshold to achieve .

&amp;#x200B;

**Example:**

Susan the witch is brewing a love potion, she is proficient with alchemist supplies and has Int 15. She rolls 7 on the d20, for a margin of 15-7=8. As she is proficient she adds 2 for a total of 10, witch er... which is exactly the DC specified by the GM. She will find love tonight with a 100% probability of success (if she doesn't drop the flask on the way to the pagan feast).

&amp;#x200B;

The dungeon has been made as a deadly dungeon, there are lots of orcs and two boss monsters, a melee guy and a spell caster. I'm okay with a total party kill (don't really want one, better for one person to run away alive) it would really set the feel for the campaign.

0,0,22,0,"In our weekly game, last night our group finally made it to a fort asylum that had gone dark, only to find it still manned and seemingly (at first) without issue. It quickly became apparent that something was amiss, mostly due to the bizarre behavior of the guards.

In one particular encounter, my kobold paladin Riff (a guest character for this quest, as my main character had a backlog of things to go through before an important upcoming storyline and had separated from the group for this mission) and his Dire Weasel Raff (Phantom Steed, giant weasel with doubled HP) were blocked entry to the fort by its captain. Both Riff and the captain showed themselves to be incessantly childish in the growing argument between them, with the captain drawing his sword and threatening to kill Riff and Raff if they tried to take one step into the fort.* Three other guards had also joined in at this point, to back up their captain.

Riff, a conquest paladin, responded with his Conquering Presence ability. Here is where we get into the crux of my issue. We play on Discord, and we have multiple channels (one of which is for DM rolls, so that rolls that rolls which need hidden can be, such as insight or stealth).

Our DM elected to roll 4d20s, of which the rolls went like this: 3, 20, 15, 13.

Only one saving against my ability, my DM then chose to give the captain, the only notable NPC in this encounter, the 20, thus saving him from being cowed by Riff.

After the session, seeing this, I took great issue with this decision. In my mind, the DM basically fixed the game to get the outcome he wanted, while basically stopping my character from frightening the only NPC he cared to intimidate. When I pressed him on this, his reasoning was that the guard captain, already incensed as he was, should be given the highest roll, as he was the one least likely to be effected by my ability.

I continue to feel as if either this unique NPC should have been rolled separately from the group, or if rolled with them should have the first roll, or at the very least a predetermined one. Choosing the best roll and assigning it like that really rubs me the wrong way, similar to if the die were fudged, making the narrative feel fixed by the DM. Overall, fixing the narrative *against* a player is kind of a worrying DM philosophy to me, as it seems pretty close to the 'playing against your players' mentality.

It should be noted that no friendships were ended, no one quit or threatened to quit, etc. I do think we're both entrenched in our opinions, though - I know I am, as I stated above.

But I'd like to hear what you all think. Do you view my reaction and thoughts as justifiable, my DM's? Is this an act you have taken, and how did that go?

*Should be noted that the end reveal was that the guards and prisoners had swapped after an outside force infiltrated the asylum and took control of it, so the guard captain Riff had a confrontation with was actually a violent patient given arms and the task of defending the fort. I had my suspicions about this before this encounter, so it isn't the captain's belligerent behavior that I want to draw attention to.",dndnext,(Storytime) Dispute over a DM decision.

0,0,14,16,"I was just wondering how some of the DMs here handle casting flavor, how the same spell can be cast differently by different characters and classes.

For example, for a cleric casting Toll the dead, the target may percieve a forcefull pull on their soul/animating essence as it is violently called forth to the afterlife, manifesting as necrotic damage to the target's body as it tries to leave.

Meanwhile, a for a necromancer casting the same spell, it could be percieved as a shove as a wave of necrotic energy tries to displace your essence within your body, doing damage as the necromancer primes your husk to be risen as a zombie.


Chromatic Orb is another one, between Wizards and Sorcerers.

Wizards see an extremely carefully balanced sphere of energy whose formula is probably far too complicated, with a containment barrier to make sure the thing doesn't just detonate in their hand and do themselves a horrible spectrum of damage.

Sorcerers, meanwhile, their chromatic orb is probably much wilder, crackling, unstable, and manifests as the desired element straight away as opposed to stabilizing during the process of casting, as well as likely leaving sone sort of whispy energy trail upon being thrown or launched.

So, I'm running Curse of Strahd currently, and I had a plan for next session, but I wanted to see if people considered it a dick move - particularly if a certain set of circumstances transpire. So, over the course of the campaign, the defenses of a town named Vallaki have been whittled down quite a bit. A few guards have died from fights with Undead (and one with a PC - long story), the vampire hunter going by Rictavio has had to flee the town, and last session the PCs killed the single most powerful man in the town, who was on the side of the authorities. Kinda. 

As such, the PCs and the thinned-out guard are more or less the extent of the defenses of the town. In addition, two enemies of the authorities are still kicking about in the town. There are five Vampire Spawn who the PCs have known about for several sessions now and, having killed one but taken a beating in the process, haven't been willing to hunt down for a round 2. And then an enemy NPC they killed a couple of sessions ago ran a cult to Strahd, who spawned those vampires. The PCs did not learn about this cult, and so have taken no actions against it.

As the PCs are likely leaving the town for a day or so next session, I thought it would make sense if the cult and Vampire Spawn rose up and overthrew the town authorities while the PCs were gone, seizing the opportunity while the town is weak. It would also show that hard choices need to be made in Curse of Strahd, and that actions, and inaction (in this case, not hunting down the Vampire Spawn, even if it was understandable) can have consequences. It would also probably help shake the slight feeling of complacency recently, where they could leave town, stop some evil, and then come back to a hot meal, a bed, and a bath. Plus, a fun few sessions of them (presumably, they might just not) attempting to retake the town, however they go about it.

So while I think it makes sense and has benefits, I don't want it to feel like I'm just going ""Hahaha, your victories are meaningless under my god-heel, players"", especially as it'll likely happen when they're out of town (if they stay in town, I imagine it'll go ahead anyway), and also because them not knowing about the cult might make it feel like an ass pull. 

Would you call this a DM dick move? Do you think it's justified and fair? If this happened to you, would you be annoyed? And if you think it's fine, are there any like, caveats to that? Any help greatly appreciated!",dndnext,Campaign Events Help - Spoilers for Curse of Strahd
0,0,70,391,"Or even in the DMG! I don't know why they cut it, because so, so many people are looking for any sort of guidance in how to structure their adventuring day. The oft' heard 6-8 med encounters really only gives you an idea of when the party will run out of resources, and isn't really design advice. Anyway, here is what the Alpha Draft says:

&gt; **The Adventuring Day**
When you’re designing an adventure, you rarely have the ability to predict how much or how little the player characters will accomplish in any given stretch of time. As a rule of thumb, you can figure that the characters will probably get through four average encounters, six or seven easy encounters, or two tough encounters before they have to take a long rest.
Since you can’t predict the path your players will choose through an adventure, you can’t really design an adventure around this daily target. But it might be helpful to bear it in mind, so you don’t force the characters into three tough fights in a row or send monsters to close off the dungeon behind them after they’ve already fought their way through four average encounters. Keep the adventurers’ need to rest in mind as you set up your adventures.

A friend of mine DMed a one shot the other day, and told us all to bring level 3 characters. Since I've never tried a bard before, I thought, ""Why not?"" I had just watched [A Crap Guide to D&amp;D \[5th Edition\] - Bard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiHXxrCB5yk&amp;list=PLDnRMnDDjAzK5uZLidDUtHtD1iN06Qe0G&amp;index=2) a day previous, so I was pretty excited. I went in as a Level 3 College of Swords Bard with Dissonant Whispers, Sleep, and a few other handy spells tucked in my belt, and let me tell you guys... we vaporized them.

Credit where credit is due, our Cleric landed a crit on his Necrotic Touch and slammed the Boss with 8d10 after turning invisible and sneaking up on him, but the one shot had a number of cinematic moments:

* Myself, our two monks, and our surprisingly dexterous fighter scaling crossbow bolts to climb a 15 foot wall with my +7 to Acrobatics (expertise stacked proficiency +4, +3 modifier from point buy for a total of 7)
* Describing in increasingly suggestive terms to the quest giver (a general in the army) how we penetrated the rear defenses of the opposing force
* Coercing a goblin into committing suicide with a unexpectedly effective use of Vicious Mockery (""Goblins are dumb, goblins are fat; I wish you would drop at the drop of a hat!"")
* One of our monks shoving two enemies off the aforementioned 15-foot wall before suplexing a third off the wall (and surviving the drop
* Stepping out from behind cover and hurling a dagger all the way across the room into the gut of an approaching Orc berserker

Needless to say, this bard (and this one shot) may have been one of the most fun I've had in a while; since then (and since we leveled for progression's sake, as we plan to revisit the characters after a time jump), the bard is now level 7, and just unlocked Dimension Door, so... yeah.

 A character's priorities as a non-adventurer might be decidedly different than the loot, XP and backstory quests of the typical PC, the challenges of just getting by, and progressing in their chosen career would give some interesting requirements to the DM to keep things immersive and give a sense of accomplishment or alternately frustration (not at poor rolling, but with obstacles to be overcome) and the appearance of even minor monsters would be terrifying without combat ability; dodging, running and hiding would be the norm, and assisting and seeking assistance alongside it.

My group and I are running Tomb of Annihilation and I'm playing a Vengeance Paladin whose main goal is to kill a man who stole ancient artifacts from his father and ruined his reputation as a famous archaeologist. We are level 7 and last session my paladin caught up to the man and with the help of the party was able to kill him, even though the DM had planned on the man living for another level or two. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that session my DM and I talked about my characters goals going forward and I truly feel like he has met his goal. He never cared about the death curse as much as the party did as his only goal was vengeance and now that he has achieved his revenge the character just wants to return home to his family. The DM suggested I just continue to play as him and maybe change my oath to something else, but I feel that the character has no reason to continue when he could just return home. I am in no way mad at the way things turned out, its actually the opposite. I feel like the characters journey is done and it would make the most sense for him to leave and for me to bring in a new character.

Completely sand-boxed meaning the DM drops you into a world they have created, and you just do things/get into trouble/piss monsters off/hunt treasure/, ect.

On the other hand, the slightly railroaded option would look a little something like this: DM has created a homebrew world and dropped your party into it, but there is an over-arcing story-line to go along with it.

Now, I'm hardly an economist so trying to put together a realistic  economy is something I feel pretty out of my depth on. My first thought was just to downshift everything in the core books from gold to silver and silver to copper, which could work to an extent but that aforementioned legendary item would still cost like 20000 gold pieces and still means a lot of spells are costing 50+ gold a pop to cast which would be a prohibitive number in the type of economy I had in mind where only legitimately rich people are likely to carry even a single gold or platinum piece at any given time.

0,0,13,1,"As a DM, how picky are you with inventory? Spell components? I could use *heroe's feats* as an example; the spell has a rather expensive material component, in the form of a valuable, gem-encrusted bowl, which the spell uses up. I think it's 1,000 gp. Each time you want to cast it, you'll need another bowl to lose. Would you have your party go buy such a component, perhaps commission it from some NPC craftsperson, and maybe something can happen to it, or just say ""the party loses 1,000 gp, the cleric produces the bowl from her satchel, and the party imbibes the feast""? Sometimes, weird interactions like this occur, where the book wants you to have something specific, beforehand, but without you knowing if you'll need it. You might find a fellow wizard's spell book, after you kill him. You want to copy some spells out of his tome, but you need special inks and papers to do this. On the one hand, the book is very deliberate in saying these are specifically required, but then it's hard to know how much to plan for, or lug around, and protect from the perils of travel.

There is a Star Wars RPG system I've read into. Honestly, I can't figure its weird system out, but one of the neat things you can do, by rolling assets, instead of successes/failures is *introduce* something into the scene. The players are sort of like characters in a Star Wars comic, and they can spend certain assets to introduce an element into the scene; the NPCs can do the same, when the players roll negative assets. 

I'm wondering how well something like this might work in D&amp;D? One interpretation is that components are already unnecessary; most caster classes get to start with a focus, and ignore the regular bits, twigs, and refuse they need to cast spells. Even some of the mightiest spells don't require gp value components. This might make some of the spendier spells just have a light limiter of ""how often can you afford to cast this, for the benefit?"", based on how much gold you have, and nothing else. Would you maybe just say ""the wizard wants to scribe this spell, which costs him 700 gp, and several hours of his long rest"", and just say it happened? The money metaphysically disappeared from his pocket, and the inks are present? Say ""the party wants to X, so deduct 1,000 gp from their inventory, the caster produces X's component, and they do their thing. Where did the component come from? Who knows? Must have stopped at a shop on the way. I can see where it feels a little hollow; if the party gets caught, there's no risk of losing the components, and thus costing them the benefits of the spell, and I really like them actually talking to the surrounding world, but that's just me, and who wants to plan out the minutiae of lugging around expensive bowls, or vials of special ink, and having to wait for the next downtime?

As I learn I'm too detail-oriented, and this is not always a popular DM trait, would something like the above work? Is it already what you typically do? Ignore shops, and just say ""we spent some money, and got the stuff; let's skip the interaction""? If we can cast it, and we have the money, we can assume we have the necessary stuff, no questions asked? Thanks for your thoughts!",dndnext,Opinion - Picky with Inventory?

**Bolo, weapon**

*Very rare, requires attunement by a monk*

This weapon appears to be a sphere comprised of several interlocking wooden brackets, with a very long leather strap looped around it several times. It has the *finesse*, *reach*, *special*, and *thrown* properties. It is a monk weapon. When thrown, its range is 15/30. After making a ranged attack, you may retrieve the weapon by yanking the leather strap (no action required).


The weapon deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Besides dealing damage, the bolo can be used in the following ways:

* When you hit a large or smaller creature with a melee attack with this weapon, you can attempt to trip the target instead of dealing damage. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw using your Ki save DC or be knocked prone.
* When you hit a large or smaller creature with a ranged attack with this weapon, you can release the leather strap, causing the ball to break apart into a net weighted with wooden brackets. In addition to taking damage as usual, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw using your Ki save DC or be restrained. A creature restrained in this way can break free by using its action to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
You cannot retrieve the bolo by yanking the strap when you choose this option.
* As an action, you trip up distant enemies by hurling the bolo at a point within 30 feet of you. Choose up to two medium or smaller creatures within 10 feet of that point. If a creature you chose attempts to move 1 foot or more on its next turn, it must make a Dexterity saving throw using your Ki save DC or fall prone.

0,0,22,5,"I’ve been running a long term campaign for almost a year now and as the PCs power level has risen (they’re level 11, with tons of magic items) so have the tensions between them. 

I love the drama of potential PvP, so I’ve allowed it from the beginning. I know it can lead to some toxicity, but we have a carefully worded session 0 document about consent and fun that I think does a good job of keeping the players themselves happy. Besides, it’s allowed a lot of Avengers-esque smack-talk and conflict that has been the high point of some of our sessions.

The problem is now that the PCs are so powerful, if they start a serious quarrel, they can kill or defeat each other so quickly and one-sidedly that it destroys any drama or fun. Back when they were level 3, we had a great moment where the rogue tried to steal something from the bard, so the bard tricked him into springing a trap. This was great, it began a funny rivalry with consistently low stakes: the possibility of actual character murder was low because it simply took too many resources for very little gain. 

Now, that’s changed. The rogue tried to steal something from the cleric, the cleric caught him and cast Geas on him (“You will refrain from taking my things without my consent”). The rogue failed his save. With such a powerful spell, there’s really no recourse for the rogue that he (or I) can see. What’s worse is, if he does find a way to retaliate, the easiest way he can be sure to avoid the spell in the future is to **kill** the cleric. To me, that’s an incredibly degenerative case: the dramatic rivalry is gone, the comical tit-for-tat is gone. 

So how do I prevent the dramatic rivalry of the PCs from culminating in an all out mutually destructive war? With the PCs so powerful, I’m constantly afraid that one snide remark will trigger a nuclear response that ruins everyone’s fun and forces us to get rid of PvP.

Let's assume that a chunk is about a half pound or 8 ounces. This is an average serving. That's 3 silver or .03. Times 2 and it's .06 or 6 silver per pound. Now let's assume you have an average cow. I went with a small cow so 1,000lbs. If you take an average yield of beef, which is around 62%, that leaves us at 620lbs. Now, let's sell it at that 6 silver. That's 37.2 or 37 gold 20 silver. Now, it takes a good, trained professional to butcher a cow in about 6 hours but lets assume it's in ye olde times like D&amp;D and let's say it takes 12 hours. So a full day.

Some of them were sourced from a couple spots online and some were created by the group.

I've included the rules in this post but I've also posted the house rules on Google Drive for share. This includes the rules as well as my thoughts on why to include them.

I've given the list to the players and couple of the rules saw action. However, now I'm looking to see what the community thinks of this little package of tweaks just to make sure we're not missing anything. Again, my notes and thoughts on each rule are in the PDF on Google Drive.

These are all experimental for my table and could be changed.

1. ***Players can award inspiration.*** On top of the rules for the DM being able to award inspiration to a player, any player can award inspiration to any other player (pending DM approval). However, a maximum number of inspirations that can be carried by the party at any time is less than the number of players.
2. ***Potions can be consumed using a bonus action.*** Characters can use a potion on themselves as a bonus action. Potions are still an action to administer them on a fellow party member.
3. ***All characters can attempt to use a spell scroll.*** On top of the normal rules for a spellcaster using a spell scroll, a non-caster or a caster without the spell on its spell list can also attempt to use a spell scroll. When doing so, the character using the spell scroll makes a skill check where the DC is equal to 10 plus the level of the spell on the scroll. The characters bonus to this roll is equal to half of their Arcana skill bonus, rounded down. If the character fails the skill check, the scroll is destroyed as usual. However, when a complete non-caster fails the check the scroll reacts violently, dealing a number of damage equal to how much the check was failed by plus the level of the spell. The damage type is the DMs choice, but should align to what kind of spell is on the scroll.
4. ***One level of exhaustion on 0 HP.*** Dropping to 0 hit points grants the character one level of exhaustion.
5. ***Skill proficiency required to Help.*** To use the Help Action to aid another character on a skill check, you must be proficient that skill.
6. ***Two-way blindness.*** When a target can’t see the attacker and the attacker can’t see the target the attack has disadvantage.
7. ***Damage Insurance on Critical Strikes.*** When a player rolls a critical hit on the attack dice, the damage dice will be rolled as normal, rolling twice as many dice. However, the player then finds the single highest rolled value on his highest sided dice and rounds its value up to its maximum value. This will have no effect if that dice is already it’s highest maximum value. *Diagrams in the PDF if this sounds confusing.*",dndnext,My Table's House Rule Package

A few weeks ago, a couple of my regular players approached me about doing a new style of game,  but couldn't think of anything that would make the game substantially different from our other games to date. One of my players really liked the idea of Legacy Weapons, or weapons that evolved with the characters as they continued to grow more powerful. I had been getting into the idea of using Tarot Cards as a way to begin an adventure, much in the same way that Curse of Strahd uses a Tarokka Deck to shape the story. After a couple days of mulling it over, I came up with a system that's pretty simple on paper, but turned out to be a really neat and refreshing way to make a character. Feel free to use my setup in it's entirety, or adjust to your own preference. One of the things I found most enjoyable was how easy the system was to tweak, and how much of an impact it had on my players.  


To begin the session, I started the game with each player sitting in the same room as me and one another. The lights were dark, like a seance. I narrated that each of the players found themselves in a nearly endless black space, with a vast void stretching out all around them. Each player appeared to one another as wisps of energy, little motes of light that hung in the air. A figure in a cloak explained that each character had died at a similar time to one another, but that they would be offered the chance to return to the world, albeit with some slight changes. The players eagerly agreed. I narrated that each player was taken to another room by the cloaked figure, while physically proceeding to do so out of game. I then set up my system:  


To determine a Player's race, I had them roll percentile dice that were laid before them. I used a random character generator chart to determine what race would correspond to each roll (I.e. 20-25 for Elves, 55-60 for Dwarves, etc). Once the player had rolled, I would roll a set of dice before me. The player was then free to choose to either use their roll or mine, without being told what each roll corresponded to. After a race was chosen, I would narrate how the mote of light that was their form began to stretch and take on attributes from their chosen race (i.e. scales for Dragonborn, feathers for Kenku, lithe limbs for Elves). Once this process was completed, I would move the player to another station designed for determining their character's stats.  


To determine a Player's stats, I took the numbers from the standard array and placed them on face down index cards that were spread out in front of the player. Players were encouraged to flip over the cards one at a time, and read aloud the number they had chosen. Starting from Strength and going down, we would fill in their character's stats by filling it whatever number they had drawn. Players were read what their possible stats would be, and given a chance to redraw once the cards had been reshuffled. Once they had made their decision, I would narrate how their form began to take on aspects of their decision (a racing mind for intelligence, nimble movement for dexterity, etc).   


To determine a Player's starting Legacy Weapon, they would be given a deck of standard playing cards. Each card had been assigned to a weapon in the Player's Handbook, or an important item (spell book, holy symbol, etc). The player would draw three cards. Once a card had been drawn, I would narrate how a pillar would rise from the void, and the item would be available for the Player to choose. Depending on the order chosen, I would add elemental descriptions to each item (""A scimitar bathed in moonlight sits before you"", ""A bow writhing with flickering flames presents itself"" ""A dagger cloaked in shadow sleepily drifts on the pedestal""). Once the Player had drawn three cards, I would draw a fourth, and choose an element that I felt was appropriate to the weapon. The Player would then choose which weapon they wished to take.   


Finally, the player was taken to a group of Tarot Cards, and asked to choose one that resonated deeply with them. This card would serve as their name to their compatriots, as well as provide them with other possible details (an indication of their past life, possibly attached Feats, etc. For the sake of my players who may be reading this, I'll leave this a little vague and up to your own discretion about what meaning you want to attach to this reading.)   


When all was done, the process would go a little something like this: I would take a player into the room, and explain that we would to begin by shaping their form. The player would be instructed to roll the dice. In this example, they rolled a 94, so they became a Dragonborn. I narrate claws and scales beginning to shape themselves from the mote of light. We moved to choosing their stats. They choose the cards in an order the prioritized Strength and Wisdom, which is lucky, as they were thinking about playing a Cleric to begin with. I explain that their form begins to grow stronger, both in body and in spirit. We move to choosing weapons. They draw a dagger, a whip, a trident, and a warhammer. They choose the warhammer. Finally, they chose a Tarot Card. In this instance, the player drew the Judgement card. The character's temporary name (until another is chosen later in the game) is Judgement. After all this is done, the character is cast into the world and the process begins with the next player.   


All and all, it's a fairly simple system, and I'd be very surprised if it hadn't been done before, but I thought I'd put it out here if any other Dungeon Masters or groups wanted to give it a go and change up their status quo. Hopefully this helps, and thanks for sticking around this long for my first post! ",dndnext,"My Attempt at using Tarot Cards, Playing Cards and Dice to randomly generate Player Characters"

1: Replace Ray of Sickness with Inflict Wounds

5: Replace Contagion with Raise Dead

**Among the Dead**

Add: When you cast False Life you add your Charisma modifier to the the number of temporary hit points gained.

**Defy Death**

Change CON to CHA for number of hit points regained.

Add: When you cast Speak with Dead, if you are hostile to the corpse or it recognizes you as an enemy, it must make a CHA save against your spell DC.  On failure, it is compelled to answer one question truthfully.

**Undying Nature**

Add: You are immune to disease.

**Indestructible Life**

Add: When you use this feature, your hit point maximum is restored to its normal level. 

**Why These Changes:**

Inflict Wounds scales better, making it more useful for a warlock.  Raise Dead fits the theme and gives the warlock more utility than Contagion.

Adding your CHA to False Life makes the spell on the list a bit better, but it also makes Fiendish Vigor better and you can do it at will.  This gives you a substantial THP bump over a day.

Defy Death changing CON to CHA reduces MAD and will give a slight bump in healing.

Speak with dead makes this spell in the expanded list much more useful in dungeons where you can question things you just killed, and makes Whispers of the Grave much better since you can cast it at will.

Immune to disease is a bit nebulous in 5e but monk's have it so it is a thing.  This turns advantage on saves into outright immunity.

Off they go through an underused section of ancient road through a dark and ~~very expensive forest~~  ominous forest. As they leave the road to follow a trail to a large lake they are perplexed by footprints. Always found in sets of 3 they do not recognize what being would create them. As they follow the trail the path gets crossed with more footprints, always in sets of 3. They trudge on and eventually find the bank of the lake. Or where the lake WAS. it is now just a deep and wide (as far as the eye can see) muddy pit. Dozens of these footprints are marchinest towards the west, our party seeing no other option tries to cross the mudpit only its far too ooey gooey to cross. Our druid Molds Earth tirelessly for two hours to create a walkable surface to get halfway across the lake, where they see the scene of a battle with large fishy humanoids apparently having fought a large mound of mold? They stop for a rest. Tossing a few firebolts into the mound of mold seems to burn away the mold revealing something pink and squishy looking. Spooked, they hurriedly continue molding earth to move on. Just as they get around the massive mound (about an hour to get around it!) a section sloughs off, revealing a black glossy bit that looks delicious to our Lizardfolk druid, Stampy.

&amp;#x200B;

Being both intrigued, scared, and hungry from all his work he decides to overcook the damn thing. A full channel of Summon Lightning. 10 minutes of lighting strikes burns out the moss and reveals awkward looking organs and fluids flowing out into big chunks. Now extremely hungry, he starts to summon another storm, hoping to bake the mud into clay so he can walk up to the mound. As he begins this a weird WARBLE is heard in the distance... and then another... from all around. Dozens upon dozens of fish folk walk into site stopping a hundred feet or so from our party. THe lizardfolk immediately drops to his knees and throws his hands in the air. 

So do the fish folk.

Except their leader who is on a palanquin who keeps WARBLE WARBLEING and doing a little dance. WARBLE WARBLLLELRLLELEL THe leader summons power into his staff and touches the druid on the head... casting TONGUES so they can communicate. The Koa Toa thinks the Lizardfolk is a God come to smite down their FORMER god (the mold mound thing...). He backpedals and is nervous about this but is mostly relieved they dont have to fight an army of fish. The Koa Toa remark that their new god is supposed to bring the water back and good ol' Stampy is like.. ""uhhhhh Ill get to that like next week"" TO which the crowd goes wild with Warble Warbles before they break off into prayer circles. The Fish Shaman gives them an ominous warning about the Clackers and the Corrupted Ones that lie in the path they are on, and the party takes this to mean Slaadi.

&amp;#x200B;

Pushing onward, using the rest of the summon lightning to burn as much mud to clay as they can, noticing over their shoulders to the south east is some weird colored smoke. The PCs think the Thayans (undead nation) are at work on Something Big. The next day the forest turns to swamp, a foul swamp where everything is coated in a thick layer of oil or mucus. Our PCs scout out a party of what look to be KoaToans with some weird Scorpian things with them (chuul). Alas when they attempt to ambush it they have moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

After defiling a circle of stones by engraving profanities they move on.

&amp;#x200B;

And pass by the top of a pyramid emerging from the swamp water.

&amp;#x200B;

And past another ring of stones.

ClikclackWARBLE clickclick

They hear moving water up ahead.

clickWARBLEWARBLE

they push onward and find a river cutting through the swamp. 

Stamp swims across intending to use an omovable rod as an anchor on the far shore for a rope. As soon as he gets there the party is attacked.

&amp;#x200B;

2 KoaToashamans riding Chuul, and 3 other WHIPs appear from the swamp side. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the party's first fight with powerful enemy casters so the Control Water forcing them all to swim and Mass Heals take them by surprise, especially after the sorcerer blows her twinspell fireball too early in the fight. Luckily the druids summon several hordes of dinosaurs, spiders, and bears to help even the odds... at least until 3 more Koa Toans attack from the river with nets trying to drag players underwater.

In the end though, despite tons of grappling, hold persons, and paralysis poisons the party prevails with only 1 person going unconscious :( this was a deadly encounter WITHOUT the Chuul.

0,0,101,64,"A little context: My party originally comprised of a Cleric, a Fighter, Bloodhunter from Matt Mercer, Barbarian and a monk. A few sessions ago (party level 3), the barbarian and Bloodhunter perished in an arc finale where a goliath Fighter killed both. What happened was that the Barbarian, whose backstory was seeking a worthy foe to take him down, fought the enemy goliath 1v1 while the party dealt with the minions. He lost and died.

The Bloodhunter, who in-character was struck with grief, and charged in against the goliath and he too perished. The party managed to escape after killing off the goliath. The party, especially the cleric, was really affected by this. 

Now the problem is that the Bloodhunter was also keen on trying out a new class and character, so while he was in-character, the cleric felt that he shouldn't have done that. For me personally, I felt it was really well done and ultimately it's the player's character choice to play how he wants. If the Bloodhunter wants to play a new character and wanted a death to do so, I think he's allowed to do so.

Now at the current time (Party level 7), the party is already introduced to the new characters (Paladin + bard). Everything is fine, party needs some time to adjust to the new members. The cleric doesn't fully trust them yet, understandable. But now, the cleric has access to Revivify and personally contacted me saying something along the lines of:

\*Even if the soul of a character refuses to be brought back to life, I could still trick them.\*

I paraphrased it, but basically the Cleric player didn't like how the Bloodhunter threw his character like that, and is saying if a player ever kills his/her character just like that, he will force them back with revivify. However because revivify requires that the soul of a character WANTS to be revived, he will trick them somehow even if the character refuses to be revived.

I tried to reason with the cleric that ultimately, it's a player's choice if they want to maybe play a new character and want their current character to die if the situation presents itself. But the cleric is saying throwing your character to his/her death is ooc. 

TLDR: A player killed his character when the situation presented itself, cleric wasn't too happy. Cleric PM'd me saying he will force a character back with revivify, even tricking the character, if it means being brought back to life.

So as DM, what should I do? Ultimately as a DM, I want players to have a good time but if one player wants something and the other refuses, I need to come to a compromise.

0,0,9,4,"Hi everyone !

So here's the thing : I have this habit of always preparing another character just in case the one I'm playing dies. So while I'm having a lot of fun with the character I'm currently playing, I'm already thinking of what the second one will be. And after a bit of thinking ... I think it'd be rad to play something close to a bloodborne hunter, in terms of look and feel (I'll see what I can do in terms of lore with my DM since it's a homebrew world but I'm not interested in making 100% the same thing as the game in that department).For those who aren't familiar with Bloodborne, a Hunter is someone who's only wearing clothes, because they'd rather dodge an attack instead of blocking. They're meant to move around a lot, but they can use rather huge and slow weapons too. There's a mechanic in the game that makes it so if you get hit, but hit back your enemy immediately, you re-gain some of your lost health. So basically you're always attacking, and never running away from the enemies. Oh, and a Hunter is supposed to use a Trick Weapon, aka a weapon that can take another form and become another weapon, but I don't think such a system would translate well into 5e so I'm not hoping for much here, but if you have any ideas, I'm down for it.

I quickly found the homebrew class Blood Hunter, and it seems to work well with this idea ... but I'm really new to DnD, I don't want to delve into homebrew classes already, it doesn't feel right and because of my lack of experience, I can't tell at first glance if something is overpowered or not. So I wondered what could be done to make a character that's as close to a bloodborne hunter as can be ... and I think the barbarian can really work !

They have unarmored defense, which means I get to play a close-range fighter who will be wearing very nice clothes and no armor.

They have Rage, which works wonder with the idea of getting hit a lot, and hitting back even harder instead of running for your life.

... and that's it so far lol

I have no idea what subclass I could go for, and how to re-flavor the one I'll be choosing, so I'd be really interested in your recommandations. Maybe I should forget about the barbarian and another class would do a much better job at making me feel like a Bloodborne Hunter ?

0,0,6,1,"So In my world I included a modified version of nightstone from stk, but replaced the nightstone with a weapon named caliburnus.

The idea is that Caliburnus is the first sword ever made. It was created by a god named iskander, who is the god of orcs, giants, strength and steel (And is also basically crom from conan the barbarian). the idea is that the mortal races stole the secret of steel from him when his sword fell to the material plane. The sword then sank into the earth, and can only be removed by someone worthy, and also someone who can lift the sword, which shrinks to fit its worthy owner, but is normally like a mile long.

For the last couple campaigns this has not really come up, in the legends it can only be lifted by a giant/kin worshiper of iskander. Well one of my players decided to play a goliath cleric of iskander in the current campaign, so I feel I should figure out what exactly this sword does if it ever does get pulled.


So what I am trying to figure out is, exactly how powerful do you think think this weapon should be if it was the first sword ever? Any ideas what it should do? Do you think that a gods weapon needs to be an artifact or could it just be a legendary, or even uncommon, item?

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently in the Underdark in our campaign. After walking through the cave for 2 days we found a city in ruïns filled with what appeared to be moving houses. Here the Chaotic Stupid Rogue leave the group to get closer to the Moving ""houses"" to find out what they really are. After 15 minutes of walking away from our group, he gets close enough to find out they are Stone Giants. Then he gets spotted by the rock giant cause he wasn't stealthy enough. After running for 3 rounds the giant hits him with a house and instantly knocks him out and gets captured and taken with him by some orcs.

&amp;#x200B;

Next session we ended up moving through the town to get to the place he was being held and cleared it (but left the top floor untouched to first save our captured friend). We enter the dungeon to find him. Somewhere along the way, we felt a strong magic source making me summon using the bag of tricks and making me make to much noise. Enter a dungeon no enemy. Enter a room in the dungeon see the torturer holding a knife on our rogue's throat cause he knew we would be coming because of the noise. We tried talking with the torturer but he proceeded to cut the rogues throat. And then the torturer got killed by a simple magic spell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our paladin's demon armor (long story) saved the rogues life reviving him. We healed up to face the boss after that. Our druid that had this pseudodragon as a pet, used it to scan the throne room and it got killed. So before we could make any plans he used his maul to break the doors and so we had this what we thought the boss fight. After what seemed to be a rather short boss fight we tie them up. And our rogue who lost his money and was looking for his saw this hole that lead to a cave behind the throne and went in with the paladin. After 3 minutes of planning what we would do we entered the cave after them. And when they found the end of the cave they were met by an eyeball followed by another eyeball until they saw 8 eyes. and then he showed the front of the monster manual to show that they just got in contact with the beholder. And this is where the session ended.

I never DMed but I have a great idea for a champaign that I want to run. My problem is that I am looking for a system simillar to one used in Witcher Tabletop. I like pretty much everything about DnD 5e expect for one thing.

In Witcher Tabletop skills funcion in a way that if you are terrible in Empathy and and you want to use Human perception to see if somone is lying to you. Chances that you won't be able to tell that he is lying are about 90%, while the other 10% are reserved for a very high roll. While in DnD all Characters are basically good at everything to some point.

Yea sure if you have a Wisdom of 18 and you want to use Perception you get a +4 modifier, you are more likely to be successful. Lets say you roll a d20 get a 11 plus modifier, and a DC of a thing that you want to percive is 14 you will be successful. But I find it a bit stupid that if you have a wisdom of 10 you only need to roll 10 or higher to successed. 

While in witcher if a DC for human empathy is 20 and your empathy score is 8 and you have human perception of 6 you  need to roll 6 or higher to be successful. It is much less dependent on luck and more on how your character is built.

In our latest adventure, we went into a dwarven mithril mine and I thought I'd finally get a good magic item until we found a magic cold damage sword that was perfect for our Hexblade and that was it. All my character has is +1 war axe and war hammer.

I don't know at this point if they're purposefully preventing me from getting magic items to annoy me, or if they just can't be bothered to write anything good for my character. Either way, it's beginning to spoil my enjoyment of the game as they either don't care enough to put anything in for me or they're deliberately trying to make the game bad for me.

I don't know how to bring up the fact that it feels really unfair and is making me want to stop playing DnD altogether, without sounding like I'm whining that I should get magic items. At the moment it's more that I feel like I'm a lesser member of the group than the actual lack of items. I put so much effort into writing my campaign, I even built a wooden castle of several weeks for the final confrontation, and it feels like I just get minimal effort for my character.

I just feel like I'm not enjoying DnD that much anymore

Thanks

Thanks for all the replies guys, I’m gonna message my DM about it and see what he says. I really do enjoy playing with them, and we have a great laugh, it’s just this keeps building and building and making me feel a bit ostracised.

My dm first drew out the aoe, but then told him that I can move it as a bonus action if I'm close enough.

Another player showed me his laser pointer/flashlight that had a nice defined edge with the flashlight, makes a perfect circle. But again, I'd have to make sure to shine it on the same place, and cannot have it constantly on.

I have seen a couple spell templated for sale online, but cannot remember the name of the people/company who made them.

First there are those very nice plastic spell effects that are graphically detailed. Very cool, but they go under the minis on the map. If I'm moving Dawn around, which is a big point of the spell, I'd have to move the minis, move the effect, then put the minis back in their right spots. Too much work and room for error. Also this company seems to not have any spells from XGTE. Biggest they have is a 30 ft circle. I need 60 ft wide one, as the radius is 60.

Next I saw a very simple but effective one on Etsy. They're basically plastic outlines that go on the map, and fit on the 5 ft squares. No mini lifting required, but they would still get pushed around while moving the aoe. Also not a big enough aoe, Dawn is big, lol.

I am looking for something that suits the outdoorsiness of the 2 regular characters more, so they can use their abilities perhaps more effectively than they would in a dungeon. That's not to say they'll never adventure in a dungeon, but I'd like them to get to know their character's strengths first, if you will.

I'm using the FR setting, but I can work with something that is generic by just replacing the names and lore with FR.

Or, is there a resource for ideas for adventures where I can fill in the details? Setting, monsters, and names where just the narrative and objective/hook is provided? I find I prefer to ""wing it"" rather than follow the script and having to pour through the adventure text trying to find a fact that I'd forgotten. Thanks in advance, and happy gaming.

However, I have two rules that I always use regarding saves.

* Any character may choose to fail any saving throw.
* Regarding regular saves (as opposed to death saves): A natural 20 automatically succeeds, and a natural 1 automatically fails. They're just regular failures/successes, but I might narrate them differently. This is to give someone with, say, a negative Wisdom modifier a fighting chance against that wizard's mind control, while keeping the cleric on their toes.

This is no fun and my players already have problems keeping the in-game conflicts in the game (like one player getting mad at another player because of what their characters did), so the Cleric kinda decided to look the other way/not comment every time the rogue starts acting roguelishly.

In the DMG, the crafting rules say that a common magic item costs 100gp to craft, that you make progress on it in 25gp increments every 8hr day you spend crafting, and that potions cost half as much, and therefore take half as long to craft.

So if I apply that, a common potion is a common item, costing 100gp. As a potion, that cost is reduced to 50gp. with my crafting feature, it becomes 25gp. I would normally be able to make 25gp of progress in 8 hours, but my crafting feature says I craft 4 times as quickly, so I can make 25gp of progress in 2 hours.

Or is the feature meant as a description of the end result instead? You craft the item 4 times faster than you normally would have: so if it would normally take you 2 8hr days, you can now craft it in 4 hours. Then it costs half as much: so the 50gp becomes 25gp.

yall should know that the character is already a level 1 warlock (sorry) &lt;3

Just going to post the topics for discussion about my build so far.

Magical secrets:

6: 

- counterspell (must take)

- healing spirit (fireball and spirit guardians are also options I looked at)

10:

- Steel Wind Strike (destructive wave also an option, not affected by spell sniper or hex-blade's curse so i chose SWS, which is affected by both i think)

- Find Greater Steed (this is the bread and butter flavor core for the character, Pegasus)

14:

- disintigrate (good damage spell, thematic, upcastable)

- simulacrum (really good i think*?* with find greater steed)(prismatic spray, reverse gravity are also options ive considered)

18:

- wish (duh)

- imprisonment (there are a lot of options alltogether, these are the most appealing to me, open to suggestions.)(illusory dragon, prismatic wall were my other considerations)

Now thats out of the way...

Race: human variant

- racial feat: medium armor master

1st level: Warlock Hex warrior for proficiency stuff and shield

levels 2-10: Lore bard, want to rush that level 10 magical secrets without losing too hard early for not having proficiency.

level 11: warlock... 
Eldritch invocations:
There are tons of good options:

- agonizing blast (must take*?*)

- devil's sight, eldritch spear, mask of many faces, lance of lethargy, and grasp of hadar
I think it depends on what you are going to experience (will I need mask of many faces? kinda thing) but i went with eldritch spear. Was considering grasp of hadar because it would add a d6 to the damage if you pulled them strait upward (because flying mount is the core of the character i wasnt sure, thoughts?)

levels 12-18: Lore bard...
important spells i took without making a crazy list would be:

-True polymorph (is foresight really all that good? I feel like I wouldnt want to waste a 9th level spell at the beginning of an adventure, turning into an adult bronze dragon to turn that boss fight seems much cooler imo)

-Teleport

-Feeblemind (seems nice.. INT save on monsters is brutal, not sure though, feedback?)

-Forcecage

-Animate Object (Be Our Guest with silverware from Beauty and the Beast... but they kill you, this seems real good to me)

-featherfall (in this case really crucial haha)...

Other feats (from earliest taken [from ASI] to latest):

- medium armor master (racial)

- Actor (+1 char and some interesting scrying capabilities)

- war caster (obviously)

- Spell sniper (took green flame blade, dont know if its good since i already have booming blade)(took the feat because flying mount + sniper... yeah)

- Lucky (because I am)

MY END ABILITIES ARE:

11 str
16 dex
14 con
11 int
11 wis
20 cha
(I rolled pretty well!)
*ending armor class of 19* (that +1 from medium armor master lol)

The main reason I built the character like this is because He is a Lance using Hero-Wannabe bard. For a long time I considered going Valor Bard but I dont think its all that versitile in the end (at least by how it looks), I like having that level 6 counterspell.. It would be hard to use a lance as a valor bard as it doesnt scale with dex (even though it should, have you ever jousted? its dex..) and you cant go Cha&gt;dex&gt;con=str... too many stats and not enough dice. easier this way to go Cha&gt;Dex&gt;Con and get the +5 damage modifier along with the proficiency with a level in warlock... Also eldritch blast, shield etc.

Equipment would be something like this at least at the beginning:

- Scale male, lance, shield... yeah.


Just started a campaign and all Im really doing is mapping out an *ideal* future. I kinda get that the whole lance focus without being a valor bard and the squishiness is a bit worrying, the main effect of the lance is to look cool but I figure with a flying mount nothing is impossible.. almost nothing.

So, a nice merchant sign with ""Books &amp; Carpets est. 1999"" would be really cool as a t-shirt design.

So, before I digress more, here is my suggestion. I'd like to hear how you would make it yourself.  


Smoke Grenade  
Common, nonmagical.  


How to make:  
Cook one part sugar and one part saltpeter into a liquid. Pour into a clay container with holes to allow the smoke to diffuse, and allow to cool. Attach a quick-pull flint trigger or a fuse. (Probably will make him roll for it if it is not crafted during a short rest.)  


Description:  
On the rounds after ignition, the smoke grenade will create a thick smoke cloud that will obscure a 10 feet cube for the next three rounds, after which the smoke will dissipate. The smoke will roll off on a slope, and will be blown by a gust of wind. This area will be considered difficult terrain to creatures that don't have eye and breathing protection (goggles/wet bandana).

0,0,0,0,"So brief short intro. One of my groups veteran players took a hiatus and has recently returned. This person loves making ridiculous characters that drive everyone including themselves crazy. For example their original character for the first campaign was a Changeling with multiple personality disorder. That is beside the point though.  
  
So due to some health stuff and timing they had to leave campaign for a few months. So upon their return they wanted to do something epic to screw with the party in a fun way.  
  
They fell in love with a post that was going around our friend group on facebook that was talking about how Werebears are neutral good and so their full moon rampages wouldn't necessarily be bad in anyway, unless people attacked them.   
  
So I am a DM who doesn't mind homebrew as long as I or my players are the ones who made the stuff, and obviously I got final say in how things worked. So this player and I worked together to make them a werebear down to class features.  
  
However to add to the funniness the player wants to be a neutral evil character, for the clashing with the Werebear thing, since they don't even know they are one. They just know they have 3 days a month where they have weird dreams and feel really tired in the morning.  We were really hoping this would lead to some long thing where people start to notice weird things and question things and eventually accidentaly discover the Werebearness. Based off the title I am sure you guys can tell this didn't happen.
  
So this character is a little turd, and they meet the party in this underground tunnel system but they are hiding from the pary initially.   
  
This character enters some combat right at the end getting the finishing blow on a big monster from the shadows with a thrown dagger.  
  
Now important for this is that the psuedo leader of the party is a devotee of Shar, but in my world the gods are kind of blocked from interacting with mortals. So divine powers are more so manifestations of the power of a characters beleif in their deity or morals.  
  
Taking advantage of this the returning player was like yea I am totally an avatar of Shar, how cool of you to notice. The other two players (not counting Shar devotee guy, and returning person), are not having this and trying to prove it isn't true. Eventually after much word smithing and many rolls they eventually convince the guy that this random person in the tunnels is not a devotee of shar.  
  
So eventually stuff happens and the returning player winds up losing a ton of health and because of the shock of the damage is turned into a werebear. So the secret was out in less than 15 minutes.  
    
  
However all is good now, the party informed the new person that they met that the world is literally in danger of being enslaved so he was like well crap I don't want to be enslaved I guess I should join up and help you stop the all consuming evil.  
  

TL;DR Returning player pushed the party too far with a ruse when they met the character. Stuff went wild and the party discovered a secret within 15 minutes of meeting the character that I and the player wanted to hide and let the party discover over time.

0,0,3,6,"Hey all,

I was helping my friend create a character that is playing a Shape of the Moon Druid and we came up with a little twist I could use some advice on.

The character is extremely inexperienced understanding his druid powers and whenever he tries to wild shape, things can go awry...

When attempting to Wild Shape, the character must roll a D20. On a 1, the character loses focus, and nature takes control. The player must roll a D100 and will transform into the beast in accordance with the list below.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRIWciP1768ZJtDhgAor16AJi4gOyR-zAGIDYmDz6jqKkvRpxn8KGsjOZGIw7bavisM8IkDfOsAnO1T/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRIWciP1768ZJtDhgAor16AJi4gOyR-zAGIDYmDz6jqKkvRpxn8KGsjOZGIw7bavisM8IkDfOsAnO1T/pubhtml)

If the roll is not a 1, the character successfully wildshapes into the originally intended creature

All other normal rules regarding Wild Shapes apply. The DM and the player are making plans to update the list to potentially add more powerful beasts as the druid levels up, but I'd like to hear any possible additions or edits any of you might have in mind.

0,0,77,42,"Today I was looking up information on how to handle a particular session of a game I run every Thursday Night when I started looking through some of the other notes on a DM's personal website listing material from their campaign. In that area I saw that they had at least 10 different heroes, most of whom had died in one way or another in earlier encounters that my party had managed to live through.

This got me to thinking about my career as a Game Master and I realized that in the 9 years I've been playing, I've never had a character die. I've killed them off when the player no longer could play (and was okay with it) or when a player sacrifices themselves for a particular dramatic story moment, but even those are rare. I've never once had a character die during combat, though a few have fallen unconscious. I'm worried now that I'm being to lenient on my players, but I don't feel the encounters I'm running from this module are under powered. How common is it in your games for character's to die?

A bit of background for my career is that I ran a 4th edition campaign from 1 to 30 with no combat death and this 5th edition one (which is Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Rise of Tiamat) has been going for a year and a half.

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the kind words. Most of the stories you hear about Parties of adventurer's always seem to involve a character dying to some ruthless DM, so I was worried I wasn't giving my players the full experience.

To give you all an idea everyone in the party is level 7 currently, we are a party of 4 (originally was 6), we all started together at level one and have been doing milestone leveling.

Throughout this campaign I'd say the group has earned a combined 1,000-1,500 gold pieces total (we don't do silver or copper for simplicity's sake). In addition to low funds we haven't really had an opportunity to purchase upgraded equipment. The best time we had for that was about 3 levels ago at a magic equipment shop and we had enough to magically enchant two player items for about 500 gold. Outside of that we haven't been anywhere that sells higher tier weapons or armor. I have the highest tier armor with having ring mail. 

I've tried lobbying for more loot, but that hasn't worked. For example, we fought a werebear and a troll last session and the combined loot off of them was 1 day of rations (equivalent to 1 gold piece) and a broken axe. The only significant loot we've ever received was a shield of missile attraction, and a mace of terror, which we've been told we can only sell for about 50 gold each. I do ask to loot most creatures, and as a group we ask for gold/loot from our quests, but it's usually something like 20 gold divided amongst the four of us.

I would like us to start upgrading our equipment and armor and was wondering what other's experiences have been with low loot campaigns? Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",dndnext,How do you deal with a low loot campaign?

This level does not count as a character level for the purpose of our proficiency bonus or how much XP we need to level up, but all other multiclassing rules apply.

Next is our Wood-Elf Druid.  She has 12 Str, 18 Dex, 12 Con, 14 Int, 18 Wis, and 11 Cha.  She is as yet undecided about her subclass.  She actually has an idea about her multiclass, and is wavering between Wizard or Monk.

In my experience, I see most players act on the meta-information the moment their character receives the slightest clue. When comparing this to a player that is just as clueless as their character, it usually (in my personal experience) takes a few clues for them to piece things together, assuming they put it together at all.

A few ideas I had were requiring three separate clues to be able to use the meta-information, but this falls apart when a big hint is given or the character has a high intelligence. Maybe an intelligence check with a DM-decided dc would work?

0,0,2,1,"Hello, I'm planning on playing a Shifter Beast Conclave Ranger (Revised) with a focus on Archery, and have two questions. First, some background:
He was just a regular human, part of a small village with only other humans, and they lived peacefully. He was a gatherer for the village, which had disconnected themselves from the rest of the world almost completely, and he absolutely loved nature, spending most of his time either gathering food or simply relaxing in the forest surrounding the village. Unfortunately, one day an extremely strong warlock stumbled upon the village and decided that having herself some slaves would be nice. The hunters tried to fight her, but failed horribly. Each of the villagers was forced to do whatever the warlock told them to do. Eventually, my character would stumble upon some new fruit, gave it to the warlock, she liked them, and gave him one wish as a reward. At first, he asked for his village to be freed, which he was denied, so then he requested to be allowed more time to himself, in the forest. It was simple, but of course the warlock twisted his words before using True Polymorph to permanently turn him into a Shifter. The way this would grant his wish was simple; the villagers were terrified of this almost feral looking monster, shunned him, and he had no choice but to retreat into the forest, taking nothing but his own weapons and clothes. There, he wanders, protecting his village from any threats that dare to invade it while attempting to figure out a way to overthrow the warlock. As for why he began adventuring, it's likely he accidentally encounters the rest of the group and offers his help, as long as they'd eventually help him out too. Favored Enemy is, as may be expected, Humanoids, because of the Warlock, and Beast Conclave is because of his innate connection to nature and its inhabitants. Besides, he's a gatherer, not a Hunter.

Now, my questions. First off, what subrace should I go? I'm torn between Swiftstride and Wildhunt, since I feel like both fit equally well (either a nimble gatherer that keeps his distance or an experienced tracker, I think both are fine with the story), while neither is much more powerful mechanically than the other either. I want him to be an Archer, so being able to get out of range easily would be useful, but Wildhunt means I wouldn't have to spend a spell slot on Hunter's Mark (nor my concentration) when aiming to track something, which would be useful. Either way, if I go Swiftstride, my Beast will be a panther and I'll have panther-like features, while the same will be true with a Wolf for Wildhunt.

My other question is: Is Hunter's Mark worth it on an Archer Beast Conclave Ranger?

0,0,30,0,"&gt; Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

So placing a Bag of Holding inside of a Bag of Holding sucks any creature within 10 feet to a random location on the Astral Plane with no saving throw.

A 2nd level Artificer can infuse 2 items. Both of these items could be Bags of Holding as it is in the Replicable Magic Items table. They can infuse new bags after a long rest of the old ones are destroyed.

~~The Alchemist subclass’s Alchemical Homunculus the perfect way to deliver and detonate such a bomb, as the Alchemist can create a new one at the end of each long rest.~~
Actually just take Magic Initiate or Ritual Caster for Find Familiar, or enlist the help of a party member with a familiar. A familiar can be easily retrieved from anywhere, even the Astral Plane, by dismissing it into its pocket dimension and then summoning it out within 30 feet of you.

Once per long rest, suck enemies in a 10-foot radius sphere to the Astral Plane with no save. Seems pretty strong.

0,0,6,0,"So our last session (I'm the DM) ended with one of my PC's head on the block, his arms and legs chained and bound, with the executioners axe at his throat. The story of how he got in this position is long but believe me, this PC deserves it. 

Essentially, the PC went full murderhobo and slaughtered innocent people. One of his victims ended up being the brother of a very powerful noble, who immediately sent out word for the murderer to be found and captured to pay for their crimes. 

I gave the PC many chances to ask for forgiveness, pay his way out of it, work his way out of it, even to escape his captors (as he is a rogue). But the PC just goes ""I want to assassinate the guard escorting me"" or ""I want to try to intimidate the nobleman"". So a few failed checks later, the PC lands himself a death sentence. 

Now, fast forward to where we ended the session. There is literally no way the PC could have played this worse, hence the reason why he ended up in this situation. It may sound like I as the DM initiated this scenario, but I made it so easy for him to get out of and he insisted on perpetuating his demise. He instigated every conflict, took the wrong turn at every option I gave him. Clearly, the PC has no way out of it. The other 3 players (it's a 4 player party) are in the crowd watching the execution and do not plan on intervening, because they despise the actions of the murderhobo PC. So what do I do? Do I just behead him and have him roll a new character? What kind of coup-de-grace type mechanic that you guys think I could use here, in order to make the execution realistic?

Anyway, I gave him the Entertainer background, but he's also a comedian (think Bo Burnham, but with a lute instead of a piano), so anytime he casts a spell he'll make a joke at the expense of the target. (Examples: cast Unseen Servant and have it trip enemies repeatedly, making fun of anyone who falls from it. Casting Healing Word on an ally, but the ""word"" is ""stop dying, damnit!"". Also, casting Heat Metal on an enemy's sword, and poking fun at them for dropping it.

I don’t know where I want this ability to go(3rd, 6th, 11th or 17th level monastic tradition feature), so I wanted to ask for opinions. 

The idea is to make a grappler who grapples with reach, uses wisdom modifier and proficiency for the grapple check and can also use Dex to attempt to trip them as a separate action. This would make it superior to the grapple to shove prone method. 

My idea is that the Way of the Spider monk uses magically produced webs from her fingertips and begins tangling them up like he’s roping a horse. The strength of the magic webs is based on her wisdom.

So:

Grapple check has a range of 10 ft. Wis+Proficiency+d20 vs Athletics or Acrobatics.

Thereafter, only strength checks can be made to escape. No amount of dexterous maneuvers removes the sticky webs. 

This way, the monk stays out of reach of her opponent while they are unable to move. 

As the monk gains more Way of the Spider features, I would like for her to have the option to spend Ki to restrain her opponent with more webbing(like a single target web spell) so that the monk can move freely. 

This seems powerful, but at the same time, casters can achieve better at 3rd level with a single spell slot, restraining multiple creatures at once while also being able to use fire spells for damage while also igniting the Web for additional damage.

On page 97 of the Dungeon Master's Guide there's the ""Oathbreaker Atonement"" option that says if a paladin breaks their oath (have to be above 3rd level, I think, to do that, but I might be wrong) they can switch to the Oathbreaker subclass.

They succeed in slaying the monster that destroyed their village only to become a monster in the process. Without a purpose in life keeping their oath becomes nearly impossible and they eventually break it in a drunken bar fight by accidentally killing a bystander.

0,0,135,89,"I recently looked at branching out from Fighter, finally playing a Rogue, but also made backups with an Oath of Redemption Paladin, and an Oath of Vengeance Paladin.

My best friend sent me an email echoing all the horror stories I've heard about Paladins after seeing I made a couple of them, mostly not thrilled I made an Oath of Redemption Paladin. Annoyed about the idea of a character that might object to the party's various killings, looting, lying/misleading, lawbreaking. Even mentioning to me that he hates Paladins and that if he was the DM and I rolled one he would go about trying to kill the paladin. He does grant that maybe his hatred of them has to do with bad people playing them badly, like Lawful Stupid.

I can sort of see this being a problem with an Oath of Redemption Paladin, at least by them not having qualms with the party's actions could conflict with their Oath.

On the other hand, I imagine an Oath of Vengeance far from concerned about lying/cheating/stealing/killing in most adventuring locales. The only thing I see maybe conflicting is if BBEG is not associated with whoever they seek vengeance on. Or if they would bother rescuing a stable boy.

EDIT: I’m not sure I can clarify this thing, my best friend is an awesome person and the main reason I’m back playing DND. Don’t exactly put him in a decent light with his “If I were the GM for this game I’d kill Paladins.” He is truly helpful and a great dude.

The group is made-up of my Rogue, my brother’s Warlock, his Barbarian, a friend’s Sorcerer, and another’s Wizard. He chose Barbarian in part so he can help me take advantage of my Rogue Assassin’s abilities. He’s a big big help, great DM when he runs campaigns and a great player too. Part of his objection to me building backup Paladins is that it’s not too far from what I last played as an Eldritch Knight, as well as the group kind of getting used to DND and aren’t much for Role Playing, with the Paladin having a higher role play aspect than how most are running the game.

Shifting the focus off from my friend (I’m absolutely certain he wouldn’t abuse me if I played a Paladin in one of his campaigns), I have my own concerns about running Paladins because of my own experiences of others playing them and shared horror stories about them.

The intro to the class is very Holier than thou Knight-y in my view, and then only shifts a bit from that once getting to the Oath of Vengeance in the player’s handbook. That was just how I saw it. I’m mainly looking for advice how to play it, keep an oath with adventurers that don’t adhere to Paladin tenets (not always murder hobos).",dndnext,Do Paladins create party conflicts? Or have to?

First is that they have nondetection. That makes them immune to any scrying or divination magic. I get it that cats are sneaky, but being able to resist magical information collecting seems odd.   
    
And then they have spell turning which makes it so they get advantage on saving throws against spells. If they succeed on a save to a spell, they can turn it back on the caster if it's 7th level or lower.

It's Ravenloft, so I can see why they might want it, and they wanted to make their own, instead of just going to the church (he'd need 25 gp/5 lbs of silver, too, so I guess that makes sense). The trick is we ran into a conundrum. They went into town, and wanted to change their gold into silver, to make that silver into holy water. *Ceremony* was their intended method, and they maybe kind of assumed they'd just get x amount of silver coins, grind them up, and then have powdered silver. 

I was more along the idea that they'd go acquire trade bars of silver, from the Burgomaster's accountant/money-trade manager, so as not to destroy printed money, and because coins are often alloyed, but 1 lb. silver is 5 gp, meaning 25 gp of silver is 5 lbs of it, and bars/coins will both have limited availability, especially if the honest Paladin tells them ""oh, we plan to DESTROY it, to make holy water. Hope you don't mind; this wealth is out of circulation FOREVER!"" And our compliner also thought they'd make 12, or so, vials, so LOTS of silver.

Needless to say, this turned into another instance of one of them whining that I'm too literal, and that 25 gp of silver is fine in coins (250 coins), which no one else is going to miss (we are the players; the rest don't matter.)

So, how would you deal with it? Am I being my typical way to literal? Should they be able to grind up coins, and assume Strahd minted no other metals in them? Is it really 5 lbs of silver into one little thing of holy water? How easy, or difficult, do you make this? Of course, I thought they'd just go to the church, and spend money on product, rather than want to make their own, but then Father Lucian has the same issues, doesn't he? A poor church priest, somehow drumming up POUNDS of silver to make little vials of holy water? I let them do it their way, again, and get 4 vials, but wonder how others would have, or have dealt with it? It sort of starts to get back to them wanting to pen spells into books on the road, but then needing ink of some value, and special stuff, but not carrying that around all the time, because you'd never know how much you might need, or if it will ever get used.

My name is Xeanheart, I was a Courtier born of royal blood, I was considered the perfect Courtier for my ability to win the favour of Princes and Kings, and praise from other men. I was able to create alliances, fell enemies with word alone, and bring faith and courage to the hearts of soliders and men who go to war. 

My mistake was challenging the king for I never foresaw error in my ideals, nor have I ever planned ahead. 

I gathered men of all class and race, the impoverished to royalty, from elves to half-orcs. I strung my words in ways that could blind men to their actions and cause them to follow through faith rather than reason. A small army of ideology and hope for a brighter future; my men followed to the palace gates, I challenged the king for his thrown. 

I never knew the true extent of the Kings power over his subjects and military. The King knew of the plans I have made and squashed the will of those who followed me. A grand army was stationed in the palace, surrounded were we--no escape and no hope of victory. I was expelled from the courts, stripped of my ranks, and had to start anew. Though the king was kind as he relinquished to soil my name to the courts over seas.

I have learned one thing from this experience, if I wish my ideals become reality I need an army that is true and grand.

So I’m back with another flavor-packed subclass homebrew.  This time I wanted to try and convert the All-for-One quirk from My Hero Academia into a workable subclass.  I came to the conclusion that I wanted to keep the abilities but strip the flavor back so you can make your own hero (or villain) flavor. Captain Mantis-Shrimp hoooo!

I bounced around the idea of trying to do this in barbarian but it seemed off to try and shoe-horn In unarmed strike rules when it could just bring over resistances from the former instead since that’s an existing subclass trope.

Check out the draft here: 

https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/S17ghzV-dE

Since I always get balance inquiries with people who don’t read the full block of text, I’m including explanations below:

Empowered physique - I wanted there to be a build where instead of the dodge flavor that comes from dex there was the option of “I’m so strong your attacks bounce off my body like insects on a windshield!”  Well, you get what I mean.

Smash - potentially super powerful yes, especially at level 3 &amp; 4 where part of the trade off doesnt exist (rectified at 5).  Forgo your two attacks for one chance at the same damage with added effects!  But beware, you might end up taking recoil if you aren’t careful.  
Note: need to specify that you need to decide how much Ki to spend before knowing if the attack hits or misses.

Paragon Form - your body is getting used to your ability to exert a lot of force!  I dabbled around with hours and minutes and couldn’t come up with anything that seemed fair outside of - ki activation with a max-time-per-LR.  Open to ideas on how to modify this. 

Peak performance - originally I wanted this to also include advantage on WIS saves against mind control effects but decided that should be up to the player where they want the trade off to be - strength or dex, con or wis.  The build is about being physically prominent so mental defenses were overlooked.

Indomitable Resolve - I’m a strong believer in capstones being a cool new on-use ability or something that impacts your previously gained features and this adds a bit of both.  I did feel it was necessary to limit the Ki-boosting potential on the smash attacks from flurry.

Looking for some great feedback on potential improvements!

Add: When you attack with your pact weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. 

**Life Drinker Invocation**

Change to: When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to 1d4+4 and you gain half that many temporary hit points (rounded down).  At level 17 the damage goes up to 2d4+8.

**Why these changes:**  This is an attempt to make blade pact work with or without hexblade (since hexblade does not need blade pact).  The goal is to make using the pact blade weapon worth doing.

Normally a subclass adds to what you already do, so everything is a bonus it is just a question of how good.  But blade pact wants a warlock to use a melee weapon instead of eldritch blast - which means the melee weapon has to be at least as good as eldritch blast just to break even.  Currently a blade pact needs 2 invocations (thirsting blade and life drinker) to be not quite as good as eldritch blast with one invocation (agonizing blast).

Additionally melee warlock in light armor can boost strength to wield a good weapon or dexterity to have a decent armor class but not both.

Using Charisma to attack with allows the warlock to ignore strength and boost dexterity as their secondary stat for armor class.  

The Life Drinker change increases the damage of a greatsword warlock with hex to be just better than an eldritch blast warlock with hex.  And it gives you a replacement for Fiendish Vigor, so you need 2 invocations but you get the benefits of 3.

Lvl 3 Greatsword + Hex + Cha is 2d6+d6+3 = 13.5

Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you.  That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction with a bonus to its damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

**Why the changes**

Rallying Cry is a nice idea that just needs more healing at low levels without raising the healing too much at higher levels.  And the need to see the fighter is removed so you can use it on downed allies.

Inspiring Surge can be great already if it lets a rogue make an attack with sneak attack damage.  This just gives the damage a slight boost.

This spell allows you to trap the soul of a dying creature in it's own body and make it into an undead servant. The creature gains a number of hit points equal to half of its maximum. Each round, you may give the creature a command as a bonus action, which it must follow to the best of its ability. If you control other undead that can be commanded (such as through the spell Animate Dead) you may give them all the same command as the target. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it may make a charisma saving throw. On a success, it's soul escapes the body and the target becomes a normal zombie (the DM has the creature's game statistics) under your control.

You may only have one non-zombie creature that has been controlled by Marionette at a time. If you cast this spell again while you control a creature that has not passed its saving throw, it's soul escapes your control and it becomes a normal zombie under your control

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of X+1th level, the creature only makes a saving throw once per minute. At X+2th level, it makes it's saving throw only once per day(?). (note: Maybe make it permanent at really high level?)",dndnext,Marionette: Need Advice on What Level This Custom Spell Should Be

0,0,15,0,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few design choices in 5e that I don't agree with (as any DM). I was wondering if I could sound out what the community thinks on each of these?

&amp;#x200B;

**Vancian Wizards**

When a wizard prepares a new list of spells, they select one wizard spell for each spell slot they possess. They must be able to cast the spell using the selected spell slot (for example, a 3rd-level spell could be selected for any spell slot of 3rd-level and above, but not for a 1st- or 2nd-level spell slot).

A prepared spell may only be cast using the spell slot(s) allocated to it. If the character expends a spell slot for reasons other than casting a wizard spell, the character must choose which slot (and hence which prepared spell) is lost at the time of expenditure.

In addition, a wizard may prepare a nmber of spells equal to their Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). When a wizard regains spell slots using arcane recovery, or another class feature or effect that allows the recovery of spell slots, they must assign each of these slots a spell chosen from this list of prepared spells.

&amp;#x200B;

The philosophy behind this decision is to reinstate the tradeoff of previous editions, where a sorcerer had more in-moment flexibility but less overall flexibility and the wizard vice versa. This is also linked to a few minor buffs to the sorcerer that I don't feel like I need feedback on (giving them the whole sorc + wizard spell list, and giving them a new spell at each level rather than having some dead levels beyond 10th).

&amp;#x200B;

**Decreased Passive Scores**

The passive value for a skill check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus (if any) + your ability modifier.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes passive perception somewhat weaker, meaning that enemies actually have a chance of stealthing against the party. It also means there's an actual benefit to making an active check, where before you were just as likely to do worse when actively looking for things as you were better. This system also matches the existing 'passive' DCs like spell save DCs. This is the only change here I've actually playtested and I like it a lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finesse Weapon Debuff**

A weapon with the finesse property allows you to use your Dexterity modifier for attack rolls, but not damage rolls.

Fighters and Rangers have an additional option for fighting style. Assassin Rogues get this fighting style upon choosing the archetype.

*Finesse Fighter.* You may use your Dexterity modifier for damage rolls made with finesse weapons in place of your Strength modifier. 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to make Dex a little less of a crutch stat, and Str a little less of a dump stat. Rogues don't take much of a damage hit because their primary damage is from sneak attack; everyone else who wants to melee weapon must either specialise a little more or spread stats more evenly (so fewer Rangers and Fighters who are supposed to be elite warriors but who couldn't lift a cat).

&amp;#x200B;

0,0,1,0,"This is long. Skip about halfway down if you don’t care about the fluff and just want to see the rules we added for minions. 


In our current game 5e, I play a Flawke, a half-orc rogue (currently lvl 5) on a quest to build an army in order to retake my rightful claim to the kingdom and birthright my younger (and admittedly much stronger brother) stole! 

While we quest to make claim on a bounty in a neighboring province, our party happened upon a small human trading village with a bit of a problem. An invading gnoll army marched towards New Brunswick. We used a show of force to recruit a small band of goblins to aid us as we helped the village prepare their defenses. I quickly assigned Bree-Yark as commanding goblin general to the small force and Pissant to be my first mate. 

Due to our druid’s well-crafted ambush and the town’s solid defensive position atop a plateau, we held off the invading force suffering only minor casualties. Unfortunately, Pissant was one of the first to go. He fought valiantly contributing greatly to the gnoll slaughter we left in our wake. Unfortunately, while attempting to leap from a burning tree, he plummeted 50 ft to the forest floor below. Prone, hurting, and without anyone to help, a lone gnoll leaped on him and cleaved his body asunder. My half-sister, a barbarian, made short work of the offending gnoll, but she was too late. 

After the battle, I worked to build trust between my newfound goblin army (a meager squad of 7 now, really) and the small township of New Brunswick. We’ve worked out a peace where the goblins provide protection of the town’s southern trade route in exchange for food and resources. As my comrades helped to rebuild the village after the hard fought battle, I was busy training our new goblin guard. 

In a show of loyalty, Bree-Yark has offered the services of his eldest son to our party. Snigbat is their newest witch doctor of sorts (cleric). We now work finalize both a newfound alliance and preparations for the journey to come. We welcome young Snigbat to our party in hopes of some day returning him to his people, a leader and a warrior. Together, our party ventures off into the unknown. 




In order to add a little flavor while giving my new minion some depth, our DM and I worked out a little system to add minions to our game. It involves significantly reduced EXP acquisition, but it works well for the little guy as he’s still a child (whoever said war was pretty?) Let me know what you think! We’d love some C&amp;C. 


MINIONS REDUX
Two types of minions
 - Static Minions (no changes, no natural stat increases, no natural progression)
 - Dynamic Minions (can level up in ONE class, gets all the bennies of leveling up)

Dynamic Minions are known as ""Enlightened"" Minions.

GAINING MINIONS
You can only have your CHA bonus in Enlightened Minions.
You must first acquire the Minion through normal RP means.
Only Minions with complete, self-determined loyalty can become Enlightened.
Only Intelligent (min 4) creatures can become Enlightened Minions.
You can Enlighten any Minion at any time but cannot reverse it.

BASE MINION STATS
Enlightened Minions start with the same Stats and Abilities as shown in the Monster Manual.
Enlightened Minions start out at Lvl 1 of the Class you've chosen with all the benefits.
They lose whatever HP they had previously and get the class's MAX HP + CON Bonus at Lvl 1.

LEVELING UP MINIONS
Enlightened Minions get a sort of Minion EXP.
Minion EXP is generated each time you gain EXP.
Take 25% the EXP your gained and divide it up among minions. Always ROUND DOWN. This number is derived from your gained EXP, but it is not taken from your gained EXP. 

If you gain 100 EXP, you have 25 Minion EXP. If you have 2 Enlightened Minions, they each get 12 EXP. If you have 1 Enlightened Minion, they get the full 25.

Enlightened Minions use the same EXP table as Players. 
Enlightened Minions must be with the Leader in order to gain XP. 
DM determines if minion XP was gained. Ex: rogue figures out a trap and opens door alone, gains xp, minion xp is not gained.

You can either roll the Enlightened Minion's HP when they level up OR take the base HP gain in the PHB.

SHORT REST
Enlightened Minions cannot use HIT DIE to heal. Instead they get (1/2 their Hit Die's total + CON) * Level.

So a Level 2 fighter with 12 CON would get (5 + 1) * 2 = 12 HP with a short rest.

LONG REST
All HP is healed as normal.

MINION NOTES
Enlightened Minions keep all their normal Actions in the Monster Manual at the DM's discretion.
Enlightened Minions do not gain any equipment upon becoming Enlightened.
Enlightened Minions do not make Death Saves. If they are not healed within 3 turns, THEY ARE DEAD.",dndnext,A story about Flawke and rules for minions. C&amp;C please!
0,0,10,0,"Hi Everyone,

In our latest campaign, I'm playing a Gloom Stalker Ranger. The stats I rolled were very average. Right now at level 5 I'm looking at the following:

&amp;#x200B;

STR: 11, DEX: 16, CON: 14, INT: 11, WIS: 13, CHA: 11

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's the thing, Gloom Stalkers CAN be amazing, because in darkness, they are totally invisible. Thing is, that hardly happens. So I was thinking of taking the Mage Initiate Feature so that I can get the Control Flames Cantrip (as well as Guidance and Faerie Fire). I like the idea of walking into a room and snuffing out all the torches and then being completely invisible. Plus, Guidance and FF are nice.

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is that at fifth level, I only get 4 more ability score increases before max (and I'm probably going to dip into Rogue for three levels, so actually only 3), and even then, that won't be for ages. Obviously I want to max out my Dex first, but should I up my Wisdom/Strength, or take the Feat after that?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,",dndnext,"Should I take Mage Initiate as a feat for my Gloom Stalker, or increase my attributes first?"

**the following is a trio of ""optimizations"" that may or may not be broken, and are designed purely for the fun of it.**  
**always consult your dm before pulling up some weird shenanigans.**

**also if you know a way of using other material to further push one of these, or see some issue,** **~~beyond the stacking of powerful build, brawny and aspect of beast being a bit iffy~~****, then be more then welcome say so down below.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Optimization of ravens.**

* race: kenku
* Classes: pact of the chain raven queen warlock 3/beast master ranger 3/circle of the shepherd druid 14
* significant abilities:
   * pact of chain: an improved raven familiar
   * sentinel raven: a sentinel raven
   * ranger's companion: a raven companion
   * Conjure Animals: when casted via a 7th level spell slot, 24 ravens appear with a concentration, up to an hour
   * faithful summons: upon being reduced to 0 hp or are incapacitated, you effectively cast conjure animals as a 9th level spell, with no concentration limit and summon 4 ravens.
      * talk with the dm if you can actually summon more then 4 ravens, as that is based upon conjuring cr 2 creatures, and not 1/4 which could be summoned to a maxium of 32 ravens

**Conclusion: one kenku, and 31 Ravens, or alternatively 59 Ravens, if dm allows faithful summons to conjure the lower cr limit of critters.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Optimized acidic jab.**

* race: Half-efl for a +2 charisma, +1 strength and +1 intelligence
* Classes: alchemist artificer 9/draconic sorcerer (Black/Copper) 6
* for simplicity, it is recommended to point buy to have 
   * 15 strength, +1 from race
   * 8 dex
   * 10 con
   * 15 intelligence, +1 from race
   * 8 wisdom
   * 14 charisma, +2 from race
* significant abilities:
   * simple weapons proficiency
      * specifically, the yklwa, a simple weapon from tomb of annihilation that deals 1d8 piercing damage
   * infuse item: guaranteed bag of holding
   * arcane armament: extra attack with magical weapons
   * alchemical mastery: add your intelligence modifier to acid or poison damage of spells
   * metamagic: extended metamagic makes spells last longer
   * draconic resilience (black/copper): add your charisma modifier to acid damage of spells
   * glyph of warding: if a concentration spell is stored within this spell and then activated, you do not need to hold the concentration and it lasts for the maximum duration
   * Elemental weapon: when casted as a level 5 spell to a non-magical weapon, it becomes a +2 weapon that deals extra 2d4 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage
      * take your yklwa, shove it to your bag of holding and cast glyph of warding containing elemental weapon, preferably under extended spell metamagic. as long as you keep the yklwa within 5 feet of the bag of holding the spell \*shouldn't\* break.
   * arcane weapon: when casted upon a weapon, it deals extra 1d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage

**conclusion: when all of this gets applied, you get a weapon that deals 1d8+2+3 piercing damage, and 1d6+2d4 acid damage and you have four instance of +3 acid damage that can be applied at will, for a total maximum of 1d8+5 piercing and 1d6+2d4+12 acid damage.**

* note that the four instances of +3 acid damage come from draconic resilience and alchemical mastery, giving both arcane weapon and elemental weapon a bonus that can be applied once, and as we know, 2\*2=4
   * also, [according this](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2019/03/16/does-the-artificers-level-6-alechmical-mastery-apply-to-the-arcane-weapon-spell/) sage advice, alchemical mastery affects arcane weapon once, from which it is assumed it works the same with draconic resilience and elemental weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Max lifts**

* race: anything with the powerful build racial ability, but for certain reasons, we'll use bug bear in this example
* Classes: order of immortal mystic 9/totem warrior barbarian 6
* significant ~~abilities~~ things:
   * obviously, powerful build racial ability as that makes you count one size category larger
   * **MUST** be 8 feet tall.
   * giant belt of power(strom giant) OR a potion of giant power OR a lucky chance you are under effect of the potion of giant power permanently
   * a friendly caster OR a potion of growth OR a lucky chance you are under effect of the potion of growth permanently
   * a friendly caster with enhance ability, the type being bull's strength as that makes you count one size category larger
   * giant growth mystic discipline, for the giant from ability which turns you huge
   * aspect of the beast, specifically bear which makes you count one size category larger
   * brawny feat

**Conclusion: so, now that all of that is typed out, let's see the calculation to our final carry capacity**

* **29 (strength)**
* **\*15 (base carry capacity)**
* **\*2 (large size, giant form)**
* **\*2 (huge size, giant form)**
* **\*2 (gargantuan, enlarge/potion of growth**
* **\*2 (colossal, your natural height) ¤**
* **\*2 (????, powerful build)**
* **\*2 (????, brawny feat)**
* **\*2 (????, aspect of the beast)**
* **\*2 (????, enhance ability)**

**all in all, you would have, while all of this is active, a carry capacity of a massive 111 360 pounds, or 55.68 tons.**

*¤as this part might be somewhat bizarre, let me explain* *~~a bit.~~*  
*according to* [*this*](https://dungeons.fandom.com/wiki/Table:_Creature_Size_and_Scale_(3.5e_Other)) *chart, which seems to be largely accurate in 5e, a creature tall as 8 feet is technically in-between being a medium and large creature, and this ratio stays the same as your size increases.*  
*if we assume giant form keeps you on percentage upon changing size, as in a 6 feet tall medium creature, which is in the middle of the size array would retain same ratio while under effect of an effect such as giant form and thus be 24 feet tall,  meanwhile a medium creature that is 8 feet tall, being in-between medium and large would be then 32 feet tall and be in-between huge and gargantuan and as this gets then increased by enlarge to 64 feet tall, you'll be in between gargantuan and colossal and thus, technically valid for either size category.*

**now, let's say why I'd say go with Bugbear instead of any other class with powerful build.**  
ye see, as you focus on the giant growth discipline you gain +5 reach, while you are in giant form you gain +10 reach, as a bugbear you gain +5 reach and a reach weapon has +10 reach instead of +5 reach on other weapons.

all of this together gives you a reach of 20 feet.  
add 5 levels of primeval guardian ranger for another +5 reach, as well as the tunnel fighter so that you can do opportunity attacks with no reaction cost, at the reach of 20 feet (as bugbear long limbed doesn't work on opportunity attacks) at the cost of a bonus action.

Can I use *Contingency* to break the action economy and cheat spells past *Counterspell*?

If I'm reading this right *it doesn't even cost an action*, the spell just happens when the trigger is met. And speaking is a free action, right?

And because it lasts for 10 days, I can cast this spell before going into danger, hang on to the material component and take a long rest to recover my spell slots.  If I were a paranoid recluse perhaps involved in some extremely nefarious shit, I could just recast these spells every 10 days and hope I don't get ambushed by adventurers on the day I cast them... right?

Brute Fighter is so far the best idea.

Its Nature versus Nurture if he was kept isolated and found making friends would be pointless if he was forced to kill them.

Obviously not Roman Gladiatorial matches, these would be death matches, plain, simple, brutal.

An update to what my players in a play by post game have been getting up to. This is all in one shared world, all happening on one continent within the same year. Because of different levels of activity and playstyle almost all of them are on a different day of the year. As some have advanced farther down the timeline than others because of downtime activities and travel time. This is part 1 of 2 for this update.       
My first post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/an0lre/first\_play\_by\_post\_turned\_into\_epic\_narrative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/an0lre/first_play_by_post_turned_into_epic_narrative/)

1. Mudamin, the Yuan-Ti cultist, arrives at the Elven city of Valentia. He seeks honest work to make a quick buck to support his expensive training in sleight of hand proficiency. He quickly realizes honest work isn’t lucrative enough for him and turns to the streets. He sniffs out some rumors and finds a couple things to coincidental to be seperate events. Over the last month rumors have circulated of a cult worshipping devils in the underbelly of this farming community. Towards the center of town where the estates and fine shops are a psychic warrior has been seen attending college classes at a small local university. And barely a week ago an imp was spotted skulking about the fine estates of the inner city. Mudamin began his investigations at the college. Where he discovered the psyker was attending classes to gain the linguist feat. He was studying draconic, primordial, and infernal to sharpen his mind. He hinted that a sharper mind would only increase his telekinetic and telepathic powers. His choice of studies though worried Mudamin and he knew he would have to be on guard around someone who might try to read his thoughts. 
2. Roven, the Lythari Elf soldier, fought in the defense of the city of Barcino. While the calvary ran down the enemy camp, and the infantry held trenches, the scouts and archers manned the wall. Roven manned the wall, however he didn’t spot any drow in that dark night. His fellow soldiers kept on shooting, and as they would go down Roven would heal them. Although Roven did not prepare any spells that would help him identify or neutralize poison and quickly the tides turned against them. With ineffective archers, the trenches were overwhelmed. Roven spotted movement on the unmanned portions of the wall, but did not act. As grappling hooks came up over the side of the wall and attached to the parapets Roven scrambled to pull them free and send the drow falling back down the wall. The cavalry arrived, doing what they could, but the trenches stopped them from counter attacking the drow. And when they called, the gate of the city did not open.       
Roven and a partner ran for the gatehouse, fighting a few Drow along the way, and began to raise the gate by turning a heavy crank. When drow burst into the room, his partner lept at the drow knocking them to the ground, and Roven had to succeed a few athletics checks to open the gate for the cavalry. When the crank clicked into place Roven dived into the fight against the drow. Roven managed to pull one drow off his partner, but the drow tackled him. Roven was pushed back against a wall, the NPC tried to drag Roven in front of a window to push him out of it. On verge of plunging to his death, Roven managed to get a dagger under the drows armor, and killed him in a violent action of many swift stabs under the ribs. The partner had gotten on top of the other drow and bludgeoned him to death.   
The two left the gatehouse to meet up with the cavalry, only to be ambushed by a squadron of drow. The drow rushed at the two elf scouts, and the elves quickly tried to dodge attacks. When the scouts had a chance to fight back arrows flew all around them. The drow dropped dead, and the scouts were saved by a unit of elven archers. The city was set ablaze, soldiers focused on carry buckets of waters from the wells, and allowed the surviving drow to route away from the battlefield. The city of 20,000 suffered near twenty percent casualties and the army of 1,000 was dealt a deadly blow of over forty five percent casualty rate. The two scouts hunted, cooked, fed their fellow soldiers as well as citizens, and did their best to help rebuild over the next three days. Before they were called in with the other two scouts that were still uninjured and not missing in action. The scouts were assigned to two elite teams of soldiers, they would be there back up, and would pierce the heart of the drow empire. Their plan was to find and free the elves captured in the last fight and any other POWs they find. And it was, without a doubt, a suicide mission.
3. Party 1, the Elven Soldiers, Lyanu leads a squad of soldiers through the war. His regiment marched North towards the borders of the wood elf, unaided by wizards, unsupported by cavalry, and without any backup or battle plans. They were sent with the orders to hold a position. They arrived at a burned down village, dug trenches around it, and laid down palisades. The empire would do anything to defend their position, no matter how little the players understood their orders. Ranga Tempest arrived at this village turned into a fort, and befriended Lyanu. They were joined by Arthur Pendragon, a human war cleric. Aquilinus a High Elf Forge Cleric. Lovianus and Manius the scout brothers joined as well. When Ranga was tracked and the camp was raided in the night by goblinoids from the Badlands the party rose to the occasion. They fought off the goblin raiders, the bugbear enforcers that followed, and chased the hobgoblin captain through the fields of wheat that surrounded the village. When the hobgoblin reached the edge of the wheat fields he was cut down. An armored hobgoblin steps forward, black studded leather covers him, and he pulls forth a long, skinny sword. He claims that his men patrolled the border and ended these fights. Dragged the bandits back to the Badlands and imprisoned them. Lyanu’s party stood down. They allowed the armored hobgoblin, The Iron Shadow, to take the wounded leader of the bandits.
4. Party 2, the Militia of Tuvalu, Akamu led a party of Lo’Gosh the Goliath Fighter, Friseal the Eladrin Sorcerer, Toby the Tabaxi Archer, Ereshki the Blind Tortle Druid, and a young Tortle fighter named Ini. They brought with them Kevin, the hadrosaur, as a pack animal, and Akamu’s new companion the bloodhawk Crimson. They broke into the second hidden dungeon now controlled by the cult of Orcus. They had the element of surprise, but were surprised themselves. When they burst into the dungeon they are met by gnoll guards; one of them being a Fang of Yeenoghu. They fight the gnolls wondering where the mercenaries or cultists of Orcus could be. When one of their questions is answered. Sensing they are greatly outnumbered and outgunned the gnolls call for help. An ogre burts into the room and the players freak out fighting the giant-kin. Eventually they slay the beast. They fight through the dungeon killing more gnolls, ogres, and orcs. When low on health and spells they flee the dungeon with what valuables they collected. Akamu travelled around the island with his animals and Turtle friends. Friseal went to religious services with Toby worshipping the trickster Lord of Cats. Lo’Gosh works with the local fisherman putting his knowledge of sailing to good use. Akamu’s band found a druid grove. The grove was surrounded by a wall of trees, grown perfectly straight next to each other, forming a circle, and forming a perfect wall around whatever is inside. Akamu finds a rune on the outside, a classic puzzle that reads in Druidic, “Speak ‘friend’ and enter”. Akamu says friend in common. I, the DM, facepalm. Akamu then says friend in Druidic. And The roots of the trees curl up, revealing a stairwell down, that leads into the sunken druid grove. Inside a dryad awaits him. The dryad challenges him to a duel. They both cast shillelagh and swing at each other. Akamu’s staff bounces off the Dryad’s hardened skin, and the Dryads staff bounces off Akamu’s shell. Akamu lands a lucky blow and the dryad disengages. The dryad dodges in and out of the trees encircling the grove, hitting Akamu with each pass, but Akamu gets wise to this soon enough. Akamu prepares an attack and swings at the dryad as soon as the woman gets in range. The dryad is knocked to the ground, Akamu heals her, and helps her up. The dryad then gives him the training to join the Druid Circle of the Forest. To further his training Akamu must best the next guardian alone, an owlbear. Akamu even gives it a shot, winning initiative, and landing a solid blow. The owlbear then proceeds to down Akamu. Determined to grow stronger Akamu travels back to the city to gather his party and bring the fight back to the cult. 
5. Party 4, the Prisoners of War, Qiang went his separate way from Lyanu seeking other things in life. However he was captured by drow once he was separated. After weeks of being drugged, transferred, and restrained. He knew he had been taken underground, how far he could not tell, and when the drugs started to wear off he awoke in a temporary prison. He was being held with a number of other prisoners, their jailer was planning on transferring them to a large compound deeper into the underdark, but for now more prisoners were arriving from above. Four other soldiers are in the mix, and so Qiang naturally gravitates towards them. Albanus the Avariel Archer, a Star Elf Psyker known as 37, Zuberi the Tabaxi Mercenary fighting alongside them, and their enemy captured with them, Sigurd the Hobgoblin grappler. Albanus had a spider, 37 had silk rope, Zuberi had a gold coin, and Qiang had an arrow he had smuggled away.      
The group quickly devises a plan to escape with the use of 37’s telekinetic powers. Before following along with their plans they tried to gather support from the other prisoners. Qiang beat Ront the orc in an arm wrestling match gaining his support through superior show of strength. Qiang also made contact with Stool and agreed to assist him. Albanus made contact with a Drow man, an accused murderer named Sarith, and Albanus convinced him to clear his name by escaping.Before joining back up with the other soldiers he quickly got a dwarf woman named Eldeth to join the cause. Zuberi negotiated with the deep gnomes Topsy and Turvy eventually gaining their support by presenting a gold coin he had acquired. 37 had a different kind of luck when he noticed another player in the lock up. A drow woman keeping to herself, but 37 could already see the secret she carried. He made contact with her, learned she had been locked up for heresy, and that she would gladly escape to travel far from here. He promised that both of them would escape and left to join the others.   
The guards came in to serve their daily meal, the group ate up knowing it might be their last, and some final persuasion checks were made. Zuberi recruited Prince Derendil and Albanus recruited Jimjar. When the guards left the enclosure the plan started, 37 unlocked the gate with telekinesis, and Ront charged the gate with Zuberi and Qiang close behind. Ront slammed into the gate, the doors slammed into a guard, and the second guard rolled away. Ront began slamming his fists into the first guard. Zuberi wrestled the sword away from the first guard. Sigurd, who hadn’t done much in the session yet, charged at the second guard, picked her up, ran out to the walkway with her, and threw her over the edge. The guard grabbed the ledge with one hand, and began pulling herself back up. Qiang slid onto the walkway, and slammed an arrow into her hand that he had stolen from the guards since his capture. The guard fell to her death, slamming into the ground below, and we watched as spiders popped out of holes in the walls and ground and fought over the body.       
The group quickly moved to not lose the advantage of surprise they had. An alarm could go off at any moment. They came to an intersection, a ladder going up, and a set of stairs going down. They had the NPCs post up at the base of the ladder and then the players snuck down the staircase. Albanus and Zuberi scouted ahead of the group finding a guard tower with a male and female guard. Albanus threw his spider at the male guard, it bit the guard, and the guard quickly threw the spider off. The female guard slapped him over the head and told him to stay professional and keep watch. This moment where they were looking at each other instead of out at the prison the players attack. Zuberi ran up and slashed the female drow with the sword he had stolen. Albanus ran forward and tackled the male guard. The drow fought back but couldn’t quite land their mark. Qiang and Sigurd ran in, Qiang helped to take out the female drow, and Sigurd used his fists to end the other drows life.      
The group proceeded through the prison, clearing it room by room, and even made an ally in the lower priestess of the prison. They moved through the prison, finding an empty room and a chest they couldn’t open. Then in the next room they disturbed the prayers of a drow guard. The consort of the warden. Ront charged him, was thrown to the ground, and stabbed through the chest. Ront squealed. The rest of us charged. Qiang ran to one side, Zuberi ran to the otherside, and Sigurd tackled the guard. Sigurd held the man to the ground while the others stabbed him. Albanus and 37 shot at the guard with bows they had looted. The guard plunged his sword into Sigurd and tossed his unconscious body to the side. Zuberi and Albanus leapt to either side of the conflict. Alabnus casted cure wounds on Ront, and Zuberi used Lay on Hands on Sigurd. Ront swung a sword at the guard. The guard ducked under the sword, the sword clanged against the wall, and stone fell loose revealing the underdark outside. Sigurd once again tackled the guard. The guard flipped over, stabbed a sword through Sigurds chest, took his dagger off his corpse, and threw the dagger at Albanus. The group continued to lay attacks into the guard screaming for him to just go down. In case things went south, 37 travelled halfway up the ladder back up to the previous room, before firing a magic missile at the guard. The spell ended the guards life and the group breathed a sigh of relief. But Sigurd was not breathing. They said a few words for him. Tied him to the guard’s body. And let Ront break through the rest of the wall. They tied a rope off and grappled out of the room with the two corpses. They descended from the stalactite the rooms were in. Landing on the ground below they scouted and made plans to climb back up a different way to go back for all the NPCs they had left behind with the cleric of the prison. ",dndnext,An Update to my first play by post game.
0,0,280,422,"Final Update:

Yeah. I could have been better about how I approached this issue and my comments and everything. I was just told that I am “The bad guy” and that I intended this post as a “Fuck you.”  And that I am a “White Knight”. And setting up strawmen And that sexism in gaming isn’t a real issue any more. And it’s all better now. And one guy even told me I was banned from ever playing in a game of his. (That one hurt...) and that I was attacking children or something. And that this post would burn down a round me. And that it is locked or removed. I dunno. 

But inside all of this about half the people who posted were glad I had even if they didn’t entirely agree with me. Two people thought it was an important enough topic to give even a bad guy two gold. (Thanks for that!)

This discussion is important. And it makes me angry. And it makes me hopeful. 

And I honestly don’t care about being a white knight (since when did wanting to stop sexism by raising its profile become something to be mocked) or a solid gold redditor. I am 45, male (some of you swing and missed on this) and am married and have been paying DND since i was 8 years old. I have two sons, 4 and 7. I finished a fourteen hour workday and spent my Substantial downtime starting this thread. 

The fact that so many of you, especially the women who chimed in, thanked me for this, I’d hope that the people who are so upset with me for one reason or another, could read their comments and thoughts and stop trying to minimize the experiences of women who are having to walk through razor grass to find safe, comfortable groups to play. It’s dumb. 

And every time we perpetuate these little stereotypes without stopping and thinking about how we fit into them, defend them and make them bigger, we are hurting our hobby and making space for intolerant idiots to be gatekeepers to our homes. 

Games haven’t been ruined by the GM’s girlfriend. They have been ruined by misperceptions, lack of communication, narrow-mindedness, lack of courage, inexperience and often straight up sexism. 

This post was a (ham handed ) attempt to bust up our assumptions about that trope but also how we handle conflict and complications within our games. 

The GM’s Girlfriend may be a real thing in a lot or even most cases. I dunno. But I can’t tell you that player responses to the mere perception of it do most of the damage to the group. 

Sorry I’ve not been perfect or even good. I hope the content of the whole conversation can be better than me. 
...

I hear SO much whining here and in other quarters about “The GM’s Girlfriend” and I really think it should stop. 

There are certainly occasions where the best friend, significant other or some sort of favored player gets extra perks and treated differently. 

But so often, the heat comes from incredibly insecure men and boys who have punishingly narrow views about how women should behave in Roleplaying games, and even if they should be in RPG’s at all. 

They had better be the coolest girl ever, with great “approved” ideas, superb patience, they have to flirt (because it’s not ReAL) and they had better not do anything weird that I am not used to. 

These women (especially women who aren’t steeped in D&amp;D and fantasy lore) are approached with such raw skepticism. God forbid your DM wants to introduce or include his girlfriend or wife into the game and she makes and unusual or not-perfectly-in-canon decision as her character! 

“She’s ruining the game!!!,” said Beer Belly McThunderFucker, the half orc barbarian, “It doesn’t make sense in the game world!”

Ultimately, it’s YOUR job as a player to engage other characters and find reasons to be engaged in the character and jump past the overly simple urge to treat another player or character like shit because you don’t like, agree with or find value in their choices. 

And ultimately, how on earth is this perception absolutely paralyzing a group of adult people so much that they can’t have a discreet, productive discussion about it and fix it if it really is an issue? Why does it become the cause of SO much consternation and most of the time this trope is repeated that there is no solution!!!! It’s hopeless! We are doomed!

You are not doomed. You are stuck. Because you aren’t communicating effectively with your DM. I mean if it is that bad?

99% of the whining about DMs on this subreddit are due to players being poor communicators, narrow-minded and incapable of engaging the unusual and wonderful opportunities new players, especially “The GM’s girlfriend”, bring to the table. 

Grow up. 

Update:
I am not going to be entirely calm about this. I am not going to make arguments that everyone is going to be happy with. I am not going to provide absolute proof and statistics backing up my point. I am not going to entertain claims that men are the real victims here and aren’t being heard. I am not going to do it. Other people here are going to do that. Fine. I didn’t start this thread to have a kumbaya campfire moment and protect everyone’s feelings. I wanted to start a conversation about this caustic phrase. 

I am pissed about this. And I’ve been pissed about it for a long time. I know many groups and places have made a lot of headway surrounding issues of gender equality in gaming. But there is a LOT of misogyny, anti-feminist, anti-woman crap in the craft still. 

I am suspicious that a lot of the MEN here feel like it’s not an issue any more. But most of the women I know who game don’t feel that way even though they are grateful for the groups they’ve found where gender isn’t an issue at all. They still feel unwelcome at new groups. And these are often the feelings of experienced, brilliant women in gaming. And I am sick of it. 

These knee-jerk responses trying to whittle down the issue and displace it and twist it and talk about the exceptions or claim it is a small problem...that’s why this issue is still an issue. 

Because the first urge most men who engage in or protect this shit is to deny it exists, or attack how I am saying it or find any way they can to not just acknowledge that people are doing bad things with it. 

Do some DMs give special favors to their girlfriends in games? Yes! But that’s not the point. The point is that it isn’t happening nearly as much as people make it out to be. And people use the perceived situation to cause further angst and chaos in their groups because of it. 

People need to grow up and start calling it “favoritism” instead of using yet another “no big deal” corrosive term that belittles the women and the game. 

It’s not this one thing. It’s a thousand of these little things. And it’s exhausting. It’s corrosive. Cumulatively it has a corrosive effect. It’s stupid. 

Make it easier for new players to be in the game. Be accommodating. Talk it out. 

My bigger concern than anything to do with the DM or the Girlfriend or favors is players not being able to communicate with other people about difficult situations when they value the situation. I hear a lot of people...a LOT of PLAYERS telling me why it’s not their fault or responsibility to learn to communicate with people about their frustrations when it comes to their DMs and gaming groups. Or that they have tried and nothing works. 

That’s not a coincidence. Because the “GM’s Girlfriend” trope doesn’t have a solution. It is the enemy. It is insurmountable until the GF leaves the game, we decide to suffer through it like torture or the group disbands. 

I haven’t had a serious argument in a D&amp;D game in twenty years or more. I’ve had games or groups I didn’t mesh with and only did a session or two. 

So yeah. 

Discuss the issue. But don’t expect me to agree with you or have you change my mind or be otherwise receptive about any of your misgivings about how I approached this or my overall point or any particular one. Just don’t have the patience or time for it. And it’s not my purpose. 

Edited #2 for clarity. Some people getting wicked distracted because of one thing or another. ",dndnext,“The GM’s Girlfriend”
0,0,46,118,"Warning: Late-night Rambling contained below.

I maybe the only one, but the whole idea of the Alchemist creating something bordering on complex life at 3rd level really bothered me. 

I know a few are bothered by the Artificer having a pet at all, esp when these abilities could easily just be given to the artificer themselves without the need to complicate an already complex class. I certainly understood their point, but the Artillerist Arcane Turrents really didn't bother me too much. I also understood the versatility that having the pets brought to the class. 

Then I realized what bothered me most, is that here we have this chemical throwing, potion brewing Alchemist, with this pet homunculus. When I envisioned a homunculus, for me two images come to mind; the artificial humans from Full Metal Alchemist and then there is the winged gremlin thing in the MM. There was just this dissonance there, of this gremlin creature just spitting up or regurgitating these salves or whatever. Yes, I know the lore behind the Homunculus. Oddly, I would have been fine with the Alchemist getting the Find Familiar spell, or some specialized version of it similar to what the Warlock gets. Why? because that would explained away the dissonance. 

Then I thought about it, well this class is about reflavoring, so what can I flavor the Homunculus as? I thought, so it needs to be Tiny (about the size of a cat or smaller) and needs to be flying. I thought about all the beast that the Find Familiar spell has, I even thought if the Artillerist got this thing, it would totally be an attempt to remake a Modrone that he or she once saw. 

Then it hit me, an OOZE! The Homunculus could be an Ooze.. yeah, may need to trade out its fly speed for a climb speed with Spider Climb, but it totally fits the stat block already with its immunities to poison and acid and, then its salves could just be apart of its Alchemical nature.  Oozes (seem to me anyways) to be a simpler life-form and you could easily flavor this pet as like a lab accident that blew up in the Alchemist face, but leaving behind the new Oozeling, or maybe even an unintended discovery or maybe some long lost alchemist formula or whatever. 

Yes, I realize that the backstory elements all fits fine for the gremlin-like homunculus as well, but to me, that kind of complex life with the average intelligence of a person, and a biology with a beating heart and all this complexity just comes too easily for me. There has to be a reason why wizards turn to necromancy and working with what is already there and how to reanimate it, over just simply brewing up complex creatures in a cauldron. To me, if WotC wants to make an Artificer Animancer subclass that seeks to animate creatures and constructs, then this gremlin like Homunculus and maybe even the Mechanical Servant from the previous artificer could fit in there. Otherwise, that Homunculus just doesn't work for the Alchemist for me.

TLDR: Reflavoring the Alchemist Homunculus as an Ooze instead of the gremlin-like Homunculus found in the MM solves the a huge bit of the cognitive dissonance I had with the Alchemist getting a pet that borders on complex life at 3rd level no-less. Yes, its meant to be reflavored, but to me, nothing solved the cognitive dissonance until I thought of reflavoring it as a pet Ooze.",dndnext,Alchemist Homunculus rubbing you the wrong way? Try reflavoring it as an tiny Oozeling!
0,0,94,13,"Note: AITA = am I the asshole

Hey all,

I recently joined a game where I rolled up a divination wizard with all the knowledge skills marked for proficiency, and got my intelligence to +3 (highest possible with point buy) for a total of +5 on my checks to know things. My fantasy for this character was that she has a number of great professional proficiencies, skills, and a knowledge of arcane magic...

Or so I thought when I designed her anyway. Turns out the other players rolled for stats and got a ton of 18s and 20s in their stats, and even though none of them are INT main characters one of them has an 18 in Intelligence with Jack of All Trades buffing his knowledge checks to be equal with mine, and the other is an Eldritch Knight with 20 intelligence that, again, makes all his checks equal with mine. Whenever I want to make a check to know something, they tell the DM that their bonus is just as high as mine and roll as well, and often times one of them gets the better roll and the information instead of me. I know I should just be happy that we're succeeding period, but I'm not.

I'm posting now because honestly I let my discontent get the better of me last sunday and used a Portent roll to screw up one of their Knowledge checks so that I could finally know something as the knowledge based character, and it didn't really go over well with them. 

Don't really know what to do at this point, though I'm thinking a group conversation is coming. I just wanted to see what a bunch of anonymous folks thought before I started the dialogue, because I personally don't feel like an asshole for feeling badly about having a character who is being eclipsed in his ONE thing she was supposed to be able to do well, but I do kinda feel like an asshole for tripping up their character with Portent.",dndnext,"Used Point-Buy and other players rolled high stats, AITA for feeling bad?"

Recently we did a hard reset to level 1 because one of our players wanted to DM Dragon Heist. The problem is it seems like the further we get into the module the more rules start to fall by the wayside to further the story that she wants to see, but I'm not sure if that's her prerogative or if I should speak up. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, last night's session opened with a group of Zents breaking into our tavern and grabbing one of the players and putting a knife to his neck. When this happened I asked, ""Does he get to roll his save against the grapple?"" She replied, ""No, it just happens. He was very quick."" Hmm... okay. Combat ensues after they try to make a deal which we refused. During that dialogue we learned that they had captured another NPC's rat familiar, which was scurrying around on the floor during the fight. Eventually I grappled one of the Zents, and after my turn the rat runs up, bites me, and runs off. I ask, ""Can I make an opportunity attack against the rat?"" She replied, ""No, you're grappling someone."" ""Right, but I just want to kick at him or something."" ""No, you can't do that. Who's next?""

&amp;#x200B;

To others who are DMing or have in the past, do you ever hand wave rules for the sake of progressing your plot?

0,0,27,20,"I'm curious to hear what sorts of ""signatures"" you add to your spells and other features (either as player or as a DM.) Things that have either no or ""minor""* impact on mechanics, but add fun and uniqueness to your PC or world.

Here are some examples to give you an idea of what I mean:

- In my worlds, teleport spells tend to rapidly displace the air/liquid wherever you appear, and so they're accompanied by a bright flash of light and popping sound. The exception to this is teleport spells that specify they use shadows - these are silent and instead of a flash of light, roiling shadows rise up out of the ambient darkness and ""eat"" you, travel like ephemeral black smoke, then vomit you up somewhere else. All teleport spells can also ignore line of effect, but have the risk of teleporting into a solid object like Dimension Door (just makes sense to me).

- I tend to make note of my players' favorite spells with ""destructive properties"" (Fireball being the classic example), and emphasize the property destruction when they're used. It can leave craters, set things on fire, destroy objects or terrain, and even leave behind difficult or damaging terrain (like little pools of acid from Vitriolic Sphere, or Gust of Wind shattering a window to make caltrops in its spot). To be clear the terrain is never directly under current enemies, but maybe something to use or avoid in later turns.

- I always have a caster's eyes glow a certain color when they're using divinations like Detect Magic, True Seeing, etc. Observant players can sometimes guess what their enemy is using from the color.

- Whenever thunder damage is dealt I describe it with cinematic noises - a boom, a crash, a grating cacophony for ongoing effects. It's always _loud_, though not louder than the sounds of the combat it's almost certainly taking place in (unless the spell specifies).

- This holds true for other damage types from spells or weapons too: fire can set things on fire, poison can be dripped into a cup of wine or w/e (as long as it's used within a few minutes!), force makes a heavy or piercing impact, cold can slowly freeze over something like a lock to make it more brittle (reducing the break DC slightly), etc. Necrotic damage I always describe as worsening existing wounds and sending black veins through flesh or making non-flesh decay/rust, psychic is a blinding migraine or terrible visions, radiant gives you the worst sunburn, veins of light, and makes you feel enervated (like laying by the pool too long).

- Stuff that uniquely harms true fiends (Protection from Evil, Banishment, Holy Word, a Devotion Paladin's Turn the Unholy, Hallow, etc.) still cause reactions for Tieflings, just not major mechanical ones. Rashes, headaches, a sickly feeling, etc.

- If a player gets smart with something like Unseen Servant, I'll allow them to do things like pour healing potions down an unconscious PC's throat or help with reloading a crossbow (extending the Loading property to two attacks instead of one).

- While they don't always get something useful, I have most animals a player talks to with Speak with Animals be positively disposed toward them (even if they're wild). It's not often you talk to a humanoid and they _actually understand you!_ How novel! My curiosity is overcoming my instinct to run/eat you!

- I let my players declare they're using a cantrip ""constantly"" if they wish (like Guidance, Resistance, or Shillelagh), but I make sure they roleplay it. You're keeping up Guidance through this whole dungeon? Ok, you annoy the crap out of your fellow party members with constant chanting, stealth is nigh-impossible, and whenever you'd be using two hands (like scaling a cliff) it won't apply. As long as they're ok with that, I just consider it a class feature.

- Healing magic is powerful and can re-knit deadly wounds, but sometimes someone can be ""too far gone"" even though they're saying (last) words. If someone's guts are hanging out, their chest is crushed, or they've lost all their blood, no amount of hp restoration'll save them from walking into the light. (This goes for PCs too - even if they're rolling death saves or failed three, they may partially perceive what's going on or get dramatic last words.)

- When a PC is raised from the dead they have a ""death mark"" - a scar or disfigurement indicative of how they were slain. Decapitated? You've got a whitish scar around your neck. Explosive Runes? Those are some nasty burns hiding under your clothes. Eaten? Are those...dragon tooth marks on your arm? I'd probably let a PC remove it with Regenerate, but they've all loved the idea so far. :P

- While you can ""detect"" an enemy's position despite being blind to them (from darkness, invisibility, etc.) if they are not attempting to hide, this has its limits. If the area's full of smoke and buildings and the enemy (or PC!) is 600 feet away pelting you with their longbow and then moving between said buildings...yeah that's gonna be a no for me dawg. Find cover!

- Not all spell scrolls or verbal components are solely in Draconic. Many other ancient languages - Infernal, Celestial, Abyssal, Giant, Elven, Dwarven, and more - were used in the origins of certain spells, so a PC with one or more of these languages may be able to decipher _part_ of a spell's incantation and guess at its purpose.

Race, Patron, Background, Name, general look. It was all in need of fleshing out. So I enlisted some help. From my almost 3 year old daughter. So I picked a couple races that would boost CHA, put the Patrons in easier to understand terms, and let her pick.

&amp;#x200B;

Step one, race. I took out the PHB and showed her the pictures for: Human, Half-Elf, Tiefling and Halfling and let her pick. She went Halfling, and I made it a Lightfoot. Step one down.

&amp;#x200B;

Step two, I needed a Patron. I left Hexblade off, and let her pick between Devil (Fiend), Fairy (Fey), Genie (GoO), Unicorn (Celestial), Zombie (Undying). She went with Unicorn, so here comes a Celestial Tomelock!

&amp;#x200B;

So Background I outlined a couple options I felt I could write decent backstory for and let her pick. Really, she got the choice between a Pirate (Sailor w/ variant rule) and Princess (Noble). I knew where this was going, and she did not disappoint by going Princess.

&amp;#x200B;

As for name, I now knew she was a Princess, so she's got a title. And my little girl gave me the name ""Rainbowface"". So there we go.

I would like to beg for your patience when reading this question. The question I have in mind is if there is anything preventing me from doing this, RAW RAI, or opinion based. That said, this post will be about Silent Image, the first level Illusion spell. Let's have a look at it.  


&gt;Silent Image  
&gt;  
&gt;1st level illusion. (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)  
&gt;  
&gt;Casting Time  
&gt;  
&gt;1 action  
&gt;  
&gt;Range  
&gt;  
&gt;60 feet  
&gt;  
&gt;Components  
&gt;  
&gt;V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
&gt;  
&gt;Duration  
&gt;  
&gt;Concentration, up to 10 minutes  
&gt;  
&gt;Description  
&gt;  
&gt;You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.  
&gt;  
&gt;(PHB 276)  


Have you watched the first Ironman film? Was it cool seeing the suit's HUD light up enemies and display their combat relative information in real time? I want to grant that feeling/benefit to my party's long range specialist by creating a visual phenomenon that takes the form of the lengthwise half-perimeter of a cylinder 15 feet tall, and maybe a little over 5 feet wide.   


What it does is act as a one way screen for the archer in question to aid her long range capabilities (to at least cancel out that disadvantage at long range). It has magnifying capabilities, can highlight creatures in red, provide night vision, provide aim assistance that projects the archer's arrow's possible trajectory, taking into account the wind speed, weight of the projectile, etc.  


Is there anything stopping me from doing this (besides DM fiat)?",dndnext,A Question about Silent Image
0,0,29,21,"This would look something like this: 

&gt; **~~Wand~~ *Weapon* Prototype:** By 6th level, you now regulalry experiment with channeling different types of magic through ~~wands~~ *your weapons*. Whenever you finish a long rest and your ~~woodcarver's~~ tools are with you, you can touch a *crossbow, gun or* nonmagical, wooden wand and turn it into a magic item. When you do so, you invest it with one *damaging* artificer cantrip of your choice - even one you don't know - that has a casting time of 1 action. As an action you can cause the magic ~~wand~~ *weapon* to produce the cantrip, using your spellcasting ability modifier (other creatues are unable to use the ~~wand's~~ *weapons* magic). *The weapon also becomes a spellcasting focus for you.* The ~~wand~~ weapon loses this magic when you finish your next long rest. Any damage roll you make for a cantrip in the ~~wand~~ *weapon* gains a bonus equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). When you rach lv14 in this class, you can invest the ~~wand~~ *weapon* with two *damaging* cantrips at the end of a long rest.

What we get from this is a very flavorful artillerist artificer that really lives up to his archetype by combining his skill and ingenuity by combining weapons with his latent magic. Just think about it, your enemies are immune to bolts? Shoot a ray of frost out of your gun. Multiple enemies attacking you? How about launching a few acid splash bombs? Enemy threatens you in melee? How about smashing your gun into his face while shocking grasp'ing him. Enemy tries to run away from you? Rope shot him with thorn whip. The flavour and applications you gain from this is just so awesome that it just begs you to build an artificer. 

Note: I mostly limited the feat to damaging cantrips so that you don't get weird magical mending crossbows. It is a slight nerf yes, but with 2+2 cantrips available at lv6 and the lv10 ability to swap cantrips, it shouldn't be too hard of a nerf. If you don't like this nerf, then just leave it out and you will only get a very flavourful upgrade to your feat. If the nerf isn't hard enough for you and you dislike trick shots like thorn whip, consider limiting it to ranged attack rolls or ranged saving throws.

0,0,6,1,"I am currently considering how one would optimise a moon druid fully to be a good tank and to also just be very good in wildshape. So far here are my ideas and also this is optimised around being a good fighter or barbarian stand in so this is gunna feel heavily martial based

&amp;#x200B;

Multiclassing

Barbarian 1 - good for the quick dip of AC and rage, doesn't impact CR of creatures that muchBarbarian 3 - good for more rages and also subclass abilities, impacts CR by one whole stepBarbarian 5 - barbarian 3's bonuses with extra attack, impacts CR of creatures by quite a large amount but extra attack makes you deal much more damage than most moon druids.

Monk 1 - good for AC, the boost can make high dex forms good tanks and like barb 1 it's not impactful on CRMonk 5 - you get extra attack along with things like deflect missile and slow fall but I think this is less valuble than barbarian 5 from the extra bonuses beyond extra attack not being able to compete with barbarian's extra bonuses

Rogue 1 - quick 1st level dip is good for grappling

Barbarian *and* Monk? - this feels like a wildcard and a big one but at the same time think about how big a combo of monk's AC and barb's rage could be. That said dex forms don't work well with rage since to get the full benefits you need to be using strength so you need to be quite specific about what wildshape you choose

&amp;#x200B;

Feats

Tavern Brawler - good for if your DM allows you to use it with wildshape's natural weapons from how useful grappling in wildshape can be (size is one good example) but if your DM doesn't allow this to be used in wildshape then don't bother.

Sentinel - this should be obvious, with how well this works at keeping enemies on you there isn't much else needed

War caster - this is pretty good on most moon druids but I am unsure about it being useful for druid/barbs, mainly from how you can just rage and use your spell slots on healing (which I will say is a very optimal strategy.) That said if you are not taking a level in barb then this is very good

&amp;#x200B;

Spells

Create Bonfire - cast this, then just hold them onto the fire while attacking them with your normal attacks for pretty good damage.

Enhance ability - bull's strength gives you a bonus similar to rage so if you are out of rages this is a good friend

Conjure animals - what's better than one huge ass bear? A trio of them. Very good for controlling the battlefield with how you can have multiple meat shields at once.

Barkskin - while this is very good for pure druids, druid/barbs or especially druid/monks are gunna make this just a +2 AC boost at best but that is still pretty good but maybe not as good as some of the other spells

Healing Spirit - 10d6 healing for you and your friends! This is so broken that no explanation is needed

To give context, we've just started, and after having all of our items stolen except for our weapons, armor, and arcane focuses, we arrived to the Death House mini-quest. For the sake of this, the party is me, Greg, Sam, and Max. Myself, Greg, and Sam had walked into the house, to which the doors slammed behind us, leaving Max behind while he was standing outside talking to locals. This is a basic summary of the ""roleplaying"" we've had over the past two days:

&gt;DM: ""The doors slam behind you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""I'd like to start banging on the doors and yelling for Max.""  
&gt;  
&gt;DM: ""He doesn't hear anything, the doors seem to block your screams.""

&gt;Me: ""I'm going to pick the lock.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""There is no lock""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Is there a keyhole?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Can I see Max through the keyhole?'  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes but he's surrounded in a fuzzy black aura.""

&gt;  
&gt;""A fire place, a stair well, and a double door ahead.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'm going to put a torch in the fire place and make smoke come out the top of the chimney for Max to notice.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""There's already a fire in the fireplace.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""How big is the fire place?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's small.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Well I'm size class small, so I'm gonna try to get in there. First I'm gonna try to remove the torch and currently burning wood.""

&gt;""I can't use my dagger or a nearby fire poker?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""You don't see any fire pokers nearby.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""If we go to the fireplace and place Greg's shield on top of it, can Sam's raven fly out of the chimney and not die?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""You can try that. You will be able to stop the flames killing the bird.""

Now, of course, Max is questioning if he would understand why we're sending the bird to notify him, but i just wanted to ask if I'm being the asshole in this situation for absolutely hating this. This has been the entire campaign for two days now because the DM refuses to just allow Max to know we are trapped. Death House doesn't have *any* of these elements, and to me it's ridiculous.

Part of me is saying leave and the current group of irl friends I DM for every week says to do so as well. Personally, I need a good fix of DnD for when I'm not busy DMing and when we have to skip weeks due to scheduling, so I can probably find another game to join and enjoy.

Another part of me though knows how hard DMing is and this guy seems to be a newbie to the DMing scene. I know first hand that people up and leaving or saying ""I don't want to play with you because you don't DM correctly"" destroys peoples' motivation and can ruin their future as successful and great DMs. I think I'm going to message him tonight and tell him how I feel about the game (since that's always the most mature way to handle this sort of thing) and try to give him some pointers as well.

0,0,30,15,"Archetypical characters are characters with very traditional designs. They have been done many times because it's very fitting for the race/class/background combination.     
Here's a few examples:    
     
- A dwarf forge cleric with a magnificent beard. He wants to create amazing weapons and armor to praise Moradin    
- A tiefling fiend warlock who has been rejected by her human mother because of her devilish appearance. But she's approached by her devil ancestor who offers her power in exchange for her service. She struggles between her humanity and devil nature.   
- A Metallic Dragonborn paladin devoted to following the teachings of the Platinum dragon god Bahumat. He tries to smite evil away and protect the innocent.    
- A high elf bladesinger who has gotten wanderlust after her century birthday. She's tired of just studying magic and actually wants to put it into practice. She of course is always looking for new magics to add to her spellbook.    
     
And then anti-archetypical are the opposite. They specifically pick a non traditional character to fight against the normal trope. But by going against it, they're sort of creating a new trope out of that.    
For example:    
     
- A tiefling redemption paladin who was born to a pair of human nobles and had a happy childhood. But when he heard that other Tieflings faced racism in the world, he packed his bags and went to do good in the world. His parents of course are proud of him for such a noble quest.     
- A Drow light cleric of Eilistraee who wants to grow past her evil race. She hopes to go back there and free her people from Lolth. But for now, she needs to find her way around on the surface world.    
- A half orc wizard who leans much closer to his human side than his orcish side. He has Germaphobia and prestidigitates everything he can. He of course is adventuring because he wants to become a better wizard and be less orcish.   
- An Aasimar fiend warlock who is tired of his angelic guide telling her what to do. To rebel against him, she forms a pact with a devil.

&gt; You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Edit: I stupidly forgot that the fighter used Distracting Strike and gave advantage

0,0,5,0,"Hello all! My friends and I started a campaign with the Lost Mines of Phandelver book (thanks to the suggestions of people here) a little over a month ago. It has been going well so far, and we recently finished the Redbrand dungeon part of the adventure. One notable thing happened though, which I'd like some suggestions on how to proceed with. 

They had made a deal with the nothic to just chill out and let them pass in exchange for feeding it. After that, the party managed to deal with Iarno pretty handily after finding the secret passage to his room through the storage room. They then knocked him out and stowed him away in the storage room by the cavern (with the nothic) while they went and dealt with the rest of the dungeon. They proceeded to clear the dungeon, but instead of heading back to grab Iarno, they decided to take a short rest in one of the other dungeon rooms. Giving the nothic a hour alone with Iarno.

After some deliberation, and rolling some dice to see what would happen, the party returned to find an empty storehouse with some tracks leading outside. Some survival checks later, they deduced that the nothic had taken the unconscious wizard and left. They tracked it outside into the woods, but were unable to push forward in tracking it through the woods. The party really enjoyed this twist, but....

I'm not entirely sure what to do with this nothic and wizard now, and my players seem to expect to see them again.  I'd love some ideas or suggestions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure how common Nothics are, so here is some quick info. According to the book, nothics were formerly wizards who became nothics due to some arcane accident or by gaining some forbidden knowledge. They have no knowledge of their previous lives, are completely insane, and are reasonably intelligent with telepathic abilities. They use these telepathic abilities to steal secrets from people.

0,0,17,12,"The idea that a protagonist is in some way inherently special is a super popular trope in fantasy. It comes up in so much of literature that there is a prophecy that this one person will show up and save the day. It's extremely hard even in novels to do this well, and even then many believe it ruins the conflict for the reader.  


Not here to debate the validity of the ""Chosen One"" trope, but it is inevitable that DMs will try to make it happen. I think it's an issue that needs to be approached very, very delicately. I've been tinkering with an idea for it to function in my own campaign, and I'd love to hear concepts of how it has worked previously or how it could work in your campaign.  


My idea is based off of the Greek myth of the Isles of the Blessed. The premise is that if you were an exceptional person you can try to achieve the best possible afterlife by reincarnating and trying again. If I implemented this, I would rule that any PC who was created would have been one of these reincarnated souls- I can then use this to justify special powers that only a truly pure soul could gain access to.  


As far as prophecies go, I'm fiddling with the idea that they should be functionally instruction manuals for how an event will *someday* come to pass, with no mention of when it will or under what circumstances. Example- want to free a powerful deity from its prison? It will happen someday by performing X, Y, and Z. Who will do that and when? No clue. It could be the PCs, or maybe not.

My most casual persona is that of a young but tall male human with pale, freckled skin, green eyes, curly brown hair, and a close cut beard, named Rodom Kurkav. He tends to be more upbeat, and has a thunderous, earnest, almost contagious laugh that leaves him red faced and short of breath. He's the one I go to whenever I need to interact with other races, or just while I go about my day whenever Im in a good mood.

My persona for formal affairs is associated with my family, and mostly used in my home village: a stout, narrow-faced male half-elf, with brown eyes, a copperish skin tone and black hair, named Ayas. My particular take on him has a more pronounced chin than the rest of my family, and longer hair. This persona tends towards short, polite sentences. When I feel awkward or uncomfortable, sometimes my nose will become more narrow and pointed, like Ayas'.

Then I have a persona for playing music, which is a thin, visibly aged, female mountain dwarf with bright blue eyes and waist-length black braided hair, named Jastebyrn. She has a little bit of a tortured artist thing going on, and I tend to use her to express and process sorrow, anger, disappointment: those kinds of emotions.

Then there was the persona I was given during my apprenticeship as an artificer. This one is a small, youthful female half-elf with moon elf esque alabaster skin and shoulder-length blue-black hair, named Vela. I turn into her when I'm changing my spell list, crafting an item, or otherwise hard at work on anything intellectual in nature.

My last persona is much more... personal. Nix is married, and as an expression of their affection, he and his spouse, Fie, created a shared persona, using their favorite aspects of each other's personas. The resulting persona, named Elyn, is a thin female human with pale, freckled skin and long straight red hair who loves, loves, loves to cook. Like, Elyn is my divergent persona, so we're talking full expertise in cooks' utensils here. Nobody else has seen this persona, and, despite being the cook in the party, I refuse to use Elyn, because I dont want anybody else to see her. Sometimes I will turn into her just before bed, when I dont think anybody else is awake, and Im thinking about Fie. Im looking forward to being wrong sometime.

""As you approach Nix's bed, you notice that the person in that bed is a young, red-haired woman you've never seen before, looking at a locket.

Without going into too much detail, I do not want to min/max a character. As long as it plays well, I'm cool with it. The background of the character is much more important to me for the build. However, let's get into my question.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to play a variant human (extra feat) tomelock (warlock with tome of secrets) but based on my character background I might want to involve a bard and multiclass. However, I want most levels in Warlock. So here are my options, I think:

&amp;#x200B;

I can take 1 lvl in bard and X lvls in Warlock. I would do this for bardic inspiration, healing word, viscous mockery and another lvl 1 spell. Now bardic inspiration, healing word, message and viscous mockery would really flavor up the character. I also don't know which lvl 1 spell from the bard I would additionally get...

However, I could also use the extra feat from variant human to get Magic Initiate to learn viscous mockery, message and healing word. I won't get bardic inspiration however and the extra lvl 1 bardic spell. Also, I can cast healing word only once per long rest. But then I can be a pure warlock.

&amp;#x200B;

So, any advice :-) ? Magic Initiate or 1 lvl in bard? Or maybe 2 or 3 lvls in bard? I know most do 2 lvls in Warlock and X in Bard, but that is not my aim.

0,0,36,4,"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/b2zi8w/what_the_heck_is_5es_charisma_though/), this is a question that I've been pondering for years now, and I've finally come up with an answer that satisfies me, and hopefully it will be satisfying to others as well.

First off, let's define what Intelligence is. It's the textbook example of knowledge, pun intended. You are told things, you remember them, and your ability to remember and apply things you are told to the real world is represented by your Intelligence. Obviously, this is why wizards use this as their casting stat.

Jumping forward a little, you have Charisma. It is a measure of your force of personality, your willpower, your... everything that makes you, you. The more YOU there is, the more Charisma you have. This is why Sorcerers and Paladins work off Charisma, because they are using their own personal presence to will powerful magic into being. (And Warlocks should be Int casters. fite me IRL)

However, we also have Wisdom. If Intelligence is what you know, and Charisma is what you are, what's left? It's not a measure of your willpower, because that's already covered by your Charisma. Turns out, your brain does a lot of shit besides remembering stuff. It decodes your senses, controls your body's natural processes, and even suppresses your lizard brain when necessary. Attention span, self-control... that is all measured by your Wisdom.

When you make a Perception check, your Wisdom is representing how finely tuned your senses are. When you roll a Wisdom save to resist Hold Person, your Wisdom is representing the fine control your brain has over your body. And when you make a save against Crown of Madness, that's your Wisdom representing your ability to ignore your screaming lizard brain that tells you to smash everyone around you.

(I've been wanting to make this comparison to all the other spells in D&amp;D 5e, but I haven't found a good list of spells by save yet.)

This also helps explain why monks are so Wisdom heavy. And it speaks to a big difference between clerics and paladins. Clerics require study and self-reflection to draw upon their powers. They are generally the servants of their gods, not their enforcers. Druids, on the same token, are servants of nature. Both clerics and druids are conduits for divine power, and it comes through a very deep understanding and acceptance of their place in the metaphysical world.

I have a few other ways to conceptualize these ideas that I like:

Physiologically, your Intelligence covers everything in your prefrontal cortex. Wisdom covers everything in the rest of your brain. And Charisma covers everything that can't be directly attributed to brain function. Your soul, if you will.

In general, Intelligence covers things you can learn on your own (observation, experiment) as well as things you can be taught. Wisdom can be learned, but not taught. And Charisma can neither be learned nor taught. 

I'm not saying this is the most objectively accurate description of Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma, and I'm aware it goes against some of the more niggly details of the flavor text in the rulebooks, but it's the one that seems the most internally consistent to me, in terms of saving throw choices, ability-skill pairings, class ability bonuses, etc.

0,0,8,8,"Hey folks, so I'm kinda here to vent in a sense.

I've been DMing for 3 1/2 years straight. The only breaks I had were:

1. I have been a player for a total of two one-shots
2. I have been a player for a couple weeks into a new campaign twice (So basically 3-5 sessions in both situations) before I had to take over as DM. One had real life issues, the other was a toxic powergaming DM that the party was sick of.
3. I do get to play some Saturdays for a separate campaign as of late.

I am going to basically be handing over the reins of DM to a new person, hopefully indefinitely--either they'll keep DMing or someone else will take over when *they* get tired like I am.

And honestly? I'm nervous as hell about it. The guy's fairly new to 5e, and watching him DM for the Saturday group, he doesn't seem to really think everything through. I see so many things that just terrify me. What's worse, I've tried sending him feedback (He has said he wants it), and I don't get any acknowledgement about it. Not even a ""Trystt27, you're being annoying, shut up"" or something lol. But at the same time, I know I have to let him DM--it's exhausting me beyond compare, and I long to tell my own story as a player character, rather than tell everyone else's story.

Reflecting on my behavior during his Saturday campaigns, I find that I'm struggling to simply give up control as DM. Because as much as I'm so, so tired of DMing, I love the control I have over what is going on.

I am afraid that the campaign (a module) will suffer if someone else is doing it. I'm afraid that my constructive criticism (and I always, always strive to be constructive with any of my concerns) about his DMing is falling on deaf ears. As much as I want to be a player character for just one whole campaign, one solid campaign, I am afraid that giving up the reins will just ruin everything.

**What advice or words of encouragement would you give for someone in my shoes? What can I do to assuage my fears so that I can comfortably let someone else DM without me looking over their shoulder every waking moment?** I really don't want to be that player that is correcting the DM or telling him how he should be doing something (unless he asks, of course--he is fairly new to 5e). I don't want to be worrying every second of the campaign that something isn't being done well, or done how I would do it, or whatever.

I hope I'm not coming across as a dick or anything. I'm just noticing that I am regularly dissatisfied with his Saturday campaign (to the point I almost don't want to be a part of it), and while with this campaign he would be following a module, I want to try and get myself into a better mindset, or do something to make me feel more confident in him. Because I don't want to have another scenario where I end up having to DM again, or where I am feeling like I am not enjoying the experience.

As a DM who has a degree in creative writing, it is fun to play with tropes in the games I run. So we had a lot of fun with this game, and there were many moments in that stood out, there was one moment that stunned the players. 

In the world that I made, five hundred years in the past, Bahamut and Tiamat had an immense battle. This battle was called the decimation and that caused the world to split apart. So continents became islands, a most surrounded parts of the world, and a terrible storm took over one of the seas. During this Great War there was a hero named Elidar. He was a paladin and served Bahamut and help win the war. He disappeared, but became a recognized hero. Essentially a King Arthur. Fast forward to the campaign, a criminal organization called the Crimson Order and their leaders the five generals became a full blown army and stole an artifact called the god slayer. The players soon discovered there was a leader named the crimson lord and he was trying to kill the gods and became the one god himself. But it was soon revealed that the crimson lord was the great hero Elidar and revealed that he blamed the gods for destroying his life, disrupting his family life and just causing chaos. So he thought a world with one god would be better.

Now that is covered what made me happy was how the players discovered the plot twist. It was not explained to them, they figured it out in a key moment, cause I had left some red herrings for the identity of the villain. The players had figured it when they were trying to protect a magical seal that kept Tiamat trapped. They followed the crimson lord down to an old shrine that Elidar had built to protect the seal. The golem guarding it recognized the Crimson lord as master and let him pass. The players fought the golem, after which the the golem said the master had come. And then there was a confrontation with the big bad, and then he escaped. After mulling it they realized who it was and there was a stunned silence as none of them saw it coming.

0,0,1,2,"Question on the mechanics of Possession (from a Ghost for example). 

* *Possession (Recharge 6).* One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.  
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like possession offers the initial saving throw to resist it, but once possessed, there's no opportunity to save out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Protection from Evil and Good States:

* Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.  
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. **The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.** **If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.**

Why does protection from good and evil give you advantage on a saving throw against possession while you are already possessed, if possession doesn't offer you any end of turn saves?

So, I'm thinking I need to drop in the Underdark's Greatest Hits on that layer. For right now, I've got:

* A wrecked Nautiloid that Illithids are using as a base of operations

* Some sort of Fungus-focused Druid group.

* Some Drow, but I don't know yet what they're doing.

* Maybe a portal to the Underfey through which Fomorian raiders emerge.

I've got time to figure this all out; my players are outside of the city doing other stuff and will probably do other stuff before they even start exploring, but I definitely want to begin planning early so that there can be some elements of the lower levels 'leaking upwards' (e.g. Necromancers from the upper layers heading up to the surface to rob graves, creatures in the middle levels having become hosts to Intellect Devourers, signs of battle etc.).

0,0,113,1521,"A while ago, a WotC survey revealed that only about 1% of 5e campaigns that start at low level ever actually reach lvl 20. If I'm wrong please correct me, but if I'm right, our party just entered this legendary 1% of parties.

&amp;#x200B;

I was the DM for this amazing adventure, with the players Gren, Scout, Verin and Jon (with temporary members Sarah, Donna and Tleloc voice of Tleloc). They have braved many adventures, and survived the many obstacles I threw in their way. We learned a bunch of important lessons, mostly regarding CR being a joke if you do not follow the suggested amount of encounters per day (such as beating octuple deadly encounters). We settled the debate between single classing or multi classing: both are capable of impressive feats of strength. And we had tons of fun in these two years.

&amp;#x200B;

The campaign world was homebrew, and heavily inspired by MtG, including fan favourite characters and items. The story follows the party stranding on the beach of the continent as they were travelling towards the ""grand fair"", a massive fair where people could share ideas, items, and money. They then travelled through the mountains towards this great city (lvls 1-4).

Afterwards, they decided to join a group of paladins, knights and clerics in their mission of trying to resettle an undead-infested swamp (we are dutch after all, resettling swamps is kind of our thing). After kicking out many of the necromancers from the base of operations, a purge of undead and mages started, along with obtaining hints about the overarching plot that would be later revealed. When they were done, the overarching plot got revealed, and a titanic ancient dragon came back to this plane of existence to reclaim it for himself (lvls 5-8).

The party learned of many magic items that were originally crafted when this grand villain was here the first time. Orbs of protection, swords that could slay any enemy, great siege weapons, and a monstrous dragon that could rival his power. They got the orbs, met a god, got her blessing in the great ""get a god's blessing tournament"" on the celestial mountain, then moved to the jungle to free the swords, each time finding that they were just in time as the villain's henchmen were always on their tail. They regained the siege weapons from the flying castles, and slayed all DnD's greatest monsters (beholders, mind flayers, dinosaurs, sphinxes, etc). Throughout these adventures, volo's guide to monsters was released, extending my bestiary with fun monsters like the elder brain (lvl 9-11) .

Lastly, the party went to find the dragon. They heard they needed to become the new ""defenders of the forge"", and that that was a position that could only be obtained by beating the former ""defenders of the forge"", a group of dragons. So they did. A 12th level party fighting an ancient dragon, no problem. After fighting the dragon, they cut of its head, leading all its kobold minions to worship the party instead of their old master. This lead them to start and train their roman style army of kobolds to prepare for the upcoming siege, as the villain had holed himself up inside the large central city. Then, a later dragon they slayed had control of one of the largest trade cities in the region, so they captured that, and made it their new base of operations. Then, they spoke to the keepers of the dragon and the dragon herself, naming her ""big momma"". They also got themselves a set of cool dragon mounts. (lvls 12-15)

Then they took an unexpected b-line, hunting and slaying a lich that was rumored to have a large stash of magic items to find something to protect themselves from the villain's mind controlling magic. (lvls 16-17)

Then the siege began. They brought their new kobold army (now hundreds of kobolds large) and laid siege to the city, doing continuous incursions with hit-and-run tactics, constantly trying to outsmart the villain. They met face to face a couple of times, beat his commanders, and found an extremely powerful artifact, a bride's veil made of chain mail. This was super cursed, sentient and evil, but it did help them beat the dragon later. Then, the veil took control over the paladin, who had to fight himself as a ghost version of himself, along the rest of the party, after which he revivified himself.

It's basically just a 2nd-level Find Familiar that lets you summon three familiars for an hour with concentration. It seems balanced enough, but as soon as I saw that it was on the Warlock spell list, I got all kinds of ideas.

Firstly, Pact of the Chain warlocks can choose creatures other than the normal list of beasts, specifically an [imp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/imp), [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon), [quasit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit), or [sprite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sprite).

The spell does say specifically that ""each familiar uses the same rules and options for a familiar conjured by the find familiar spell"" which should include Pact of the Chain, right? Anyone agree or disagree?

But here's the fun part: Pact of the Chain Warlocks can forgo one attack to allow their familiar to attack, but with this spell, now I have *three* familiars. Of course, you get an extra familiar for each spell level, so at level 5, I have four familiars; at level 7, I have five familiars. So, let's say I choose to do this in a game where you're DMing. Would you allow me to:

A) Have just one of my familiars attack  
B) Have one of my familiars attack per each attack I forgo, assuming I have an extra attack  
C) Have all of my familiars attack either at the cost of one attack or the whole action

0,0,17,5,"I figured everyone has had at least one bad session and I'm always like hearing people tell stories from there groups. So I wanted to tell about the session that disbanded the last group I played with.

Back during my senior year in High School a few friends of mine had a small group that varied every week, some weeks it would be four, on some days it would be three, and on the rare occasions there would be five. I had played with them for about half a year or so and sometime in April, our DM had thought that we should do The Curse of Strahd, I was excited to hear this because the way he described it was ""more role playing than action."" He then said that he wanted to have a session that consisted of a party of six or seven players and i was on board with this.

During the next week he said that he was going to make restrictions and proceeded to list them off: Your character has to be either Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or Neutral Good; Use only classes and sub classes from The Player Handbook and use only races from The Player Handbook. I could understand these restrictions somewhat, I mean this was a big group and wanted to make it easier for both him and some of the new players he was inviting. The group of people that were suppose to show up to this session were: The DM's girlfriend, his girlfriend's friend, his girlfriend's friend's boyfriend, two of the DM's friends who have played a few times, and myself.

Because of this group of people the DM decided to reserve classes to certain players. One of his friends always played a halfling bard (in fact it was always the same one, but we actually liked his character and he was always working so he never really got to play him), both the DM's girlfriend, his girlfriend's friend were playing as clerics, the DM reserved his girlfriend's friend's boyfriend both Fighter and Barbarian, and the DM's other friend wanted to be a Druid. The way I saw it was that I couldn't play a Paladin because of the two clerics and I never really liked playing magic or other ranged classes which left me with either Rogue or Monk. until the DM brought up the Blood Hunter home brew. He basically said that I could be the sort of the ""Van Hellsing"" of the group and I liked that. I was all on board however he wanted my character to have a focus on range, he knew I didn't really like being ranged and I told him that we could compromise but  that was where the conversation ended for a few days. In that time I was working on what my character looked like, his background, as well as voice. then, two days before the session was to start he walked up to me and said ""Your character isn't going to work."" I asked him what was wrong with it and that I could change parts that didn't work for his campaign, but he didn't answer. 

Then in gym class, some of the people who were coming to the session had the same class, which made it easy and fun to discuss ideas and character concepts, I overheard them talking about how the Druid was going to be a Firbolg, a playable race not found in the Player Handbook, i didn't think anything of it at the time but not even fifteen minutes went by when I heard them say ""now if only ***my name here*** played an magic class or ranger"" then everything clicked into place. He had been trying to get me to make a ranged type character, classes that I were never really fond of. So I told him that I'm not going to be coming and he asked me why. Itold him that i was worried that the session wasn't going to go well and listed off things that I was worried of: the DM was bad at improvising on the spot and if someone didn't show up to a session then he had a hard time thinking up a reason why their character was either not with the party, or doing anything; and the fact that the last time we had a large group of people ended with us ending the campaign prematurely, and the fact that the DM had the tendency to have us play D&amp;D into the dead of night from 11 am to 10 pm. during that class period I told the other two and gave them the same reasons that I told the DM and I thought that was it. as class was ending I was behind them and I heard the DM say ""don't worry if you can't make it to a session, I'll think of something to explain why you aren't doing anything."" I didn't talk to them about the session on friday and just wanted to know how well the session went on Saturday.

The Monday after the session finally came and i asked each player how it went. I asked the DM and he said it went great. I asked his girlfriend and her friend and they said it went well, I asked the player playing the Bard and he said that he was only there for an hour before he left. This caught me a bit off guard but then I asked the guy who played the Druid and he said ""It was a fucking shitshow."" I asked what happened and he said that The DM's girlfriend's friend's boyfriend didn't show up, the Bard left after making his character, the DM's girlfriend started to cry because she didn't like her character (she got emotional on a few past sessions as well but not to the point of crying), but what really caused the most damage was the Druid. The way he described how he played was that his character was a wall and refused to move out of the way of things like trees and buildings so when he came across a house he decided to punch it, and in one punch destroyed the house. The DM looked right at him upset and said ""That was a plot important house, you ruined the game, game over."" followed by him closing all his books and his girlfriend starting to cry once more. two things ran through my mind after hearing that. One, why did the session that went wrong the most have to be the one with the campaign that I was the most excited to play, but the second thing was that i was 100% right about it not going well.

I know that I was no saint in this story either but even still I have always tried to compromise with the DM on things like my characters. I spend a long time making characters that I want to play, whether because of their backstory, or because of their potential interactions with other players and npcs. I apologize for the lengthy story but this was as short as I could make it. I would love to hear about some bad sessions that you all have experienced.",dndnext,What was the Worst D&amp;D Session You have been to?
0,0,58,24,"Hi guys, looking for some more experienced opinions and takes on this encounter I set up for my players and whether I'm a bad DM or not. 

Here's the specifics:

4 players who were all level 4, point buy, max hp on level up:

- A ranger focused on dueling as his fighting style
- A paladin with a +1 rapier and plate armor, potion of fire breath
- A rogue with a +1 hand crossbow, dust of disappearance/coughing
- A wizard (necromancy) with Cape of Montebank, Wand of Webs, and of course their wizard spells

VS

- A werebear
- 2 wererats who come into the fight 1d6 rounds in.

Now by itself according to Kobold Fight Club, a werebear is a hard encounter. With 2 wererats thrown in it is deadly. This fight is coming off of a full long rest and everyone had all spell slots, all their items, and full health. Although KFC told me it was deadly, I balanced around the idea that everyone would be at full health, the encounter was 100% melee only enemies, and that they would potentially be able to completely stomp the enemies with only a couple crowd control abilities and focused fire.

The way it worked was a trap; the werebear human led them to his cave where he tricked them into thinking a regular bear was killing his friends before he closed and locked the door behind them and then transformed. This part went great and the players were positioned advantageously in terms of front-line vs back-line characters.

From there things just didn't work out. The bear knocked the ranger in a couple rounds, he stabilized and was knocked again, the bear then knocked the paladin after missing a few times and then getting really good rolls (no crits), and when the weak were rats came in they knocked the wizard and almost knocked the rogue. It ended with the rogue disengaging with their bonus action, finishing the very very low werebear off, and then in turn shooting the wererats dead. From there, nobody had any healing potions on their person or medicine kits, the last standing rogue rolled a 7 on their medicine check for getting the paladin back up, and they had to roll death saving throws to stabilize without any other means of reviving.

**For all three players, they rolled a 1.** And then failed one more save from there.

Now here's where I will complain/justify myself: At no point in this fight did the paladin perform any healing in the form of lay on hands either for himself or his downed ranger, the bear was never webbed or hit with any disabling spell, the cape was never used, the rogue switched to unarmed attacks to fight the wererats for a round instead of their rapier, the paladin also switched to unarmed attacks for a round against the werebear, and as I already mentioned nobody had any healing potions or healing spells that were used.

How can I do better as a DM? There were some supremely unlucky rolls here for death saving throws, but how can I balance an encounter around players like this? Not saying that in a bad way; I think it's a lot of fun to switch to melee and fight the bear or rat like a man. But now you're dead, like really dead new character for next time dead. What can I do in situations like this? Was I too harsh or did I put a stupidly difficult fight in?

Really looking for some feedback and opinions from better DMs than me, as I want the adventure to have danger but this is my first time killing anybody.

***TL;DR: had 4 level 4s with magic items fight a werebear and two wererats, 3/4 of them died. Was my encounter too hard?***",dndnext,"Almost TPK'd my party, 3 out of 4 died. Am I a bad DM? Did I do too difficult an encounter or was this on them?"
0,0,39,68,"So I have been reading over the invocations and mechanics of eldritch blast and just was seeking some sort of clarification on how it works.

1. As you gain beams can you split them to hit different targets or not? This is mainly for fighting multiple enemies or hitting an enemy to kill it then hitting another afterwards with a second beam
2. For Agonizing Blast does the +Cha. modifier apply to each beam individually?
3. For Repelling Blast, do you get to choose if the enemy is repelled and how far, or is it simply a straight up 10 feet every time?
4. How important is LoS for Eldritch Blast? I understand needing to see an enemy, but what if they're in like the trees of a forest? Does it just magically track or do you have to roll with disadvantage?

0,0,36,5,"I like like the idea behind the feat system for the most part but I have a few problems with some combat feats. Namely,  A.) feats like GWM and SS can be a huge power spike, to the point where some people feel they're op, and B.)  these feats while technically an optional rule, provide marshal classes with allot of flavor and power. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think part of the issue is these feats contain many different abilities. Just look at Shield Master; you get your shield's AC to dex saving throws, evasion, *and* the ability to shove opponents with a bonus action. I'm not saying SM is too powerful, but it's just allot at once. Same with GWM, SS, PAM, and others. Currently these feats have to give you so much because ASI's come so infrequently and you have to sacrifice ability scores to get them.

Instead I think it would make more sense to break these feats up into there separate components and let marshal classes choose them every two to three levels starting with their choice of fighting style, sort of like how spell levels work now. Fighters would get more than other classes like they can get more feats currently. Maybe also gate the more powerful effects, like +10 damage, behind prerequisites or level requirements so that characters can only get them at higher levels. Heck you could even do ""lesser"" and ""greater"" versions of GWM like in the olden days. This would even out the power curve for marshal characters a little more and I think would give players a better sense of progression. You could even add some of the UA stuff like tunnel fighter, where its probably a little too powerful for a fighting style but maybe under powered for a feat, into this system. 

Just something I thought would make Marshal PCs a bit more interesting in a hypothetical later addition or ambitious homebrew. Let me know what you guys think.

0,0,13,11,"Yo, so I love Planescape, and with MTF getting nice and planar with it, I am enamored with the re-envisioning of the marut. Something about a giant inevitable robot of multiversal contract enforement seems, well, awesome. The question is, how would you use them well in a campaign? Obviously if there is little planar anything going on, you can rule them out, but in any game where the multiverse might be teased at or explored, particularly with Sigil, the City of Doors, in play, I'd argue they are fair game should any characters end up in an official agreement overseen by the regulators of the  Hall of Concordance.

More specifically, right now I have a 7th level party, four of whom are traipsing about in the High Forest in Faerun, and a fifth who is stranded in Sigil, having accidentally triggered an unseen portal and careened off the second-story of a pub in the Guildhall Ward. She's trying to figure out why she's there and how to get back to the Prime Material, and has befriended a Red Wizard of Thay who is a planar expert, currently studying/lurking in Sigil. I'd like to manuever a valid reason for the character (and perhaps the Thayan) to enter into a formal agreement, whether with each other or someone else, and be bound to the enforcement of a marut. It would not be until a long, long while that said agreement might be breached, but I think it would be quite dramatic if, at some point in the future, a portal rips open in front of the party and a marut descends out of the Outlands.

0,0,14,2,"TL;DR: A Priestess of Lolth Drow resurrected an Adult Green Dragon the players have killed. The players also have taken its hoard. Would the Green Dragon agree to join forces with the Priestess to kill the players?

A Green Dragon took command of a drow clan and used it to invade a small kingdom in the upperworld. After the kingdom was taken, the dragon, still keeping control of the clan, took the majority of the treasure and hoarded it, naming a Priestess of Lolth as second in command. The Priestess was not happy but, because it was an Adult Green Dragon, and that it was a smart leader, ultimately decided to agree. However, she harbored thoughts of toppling this dragon.

Then the players came along, and after striking a deal with the Priestess, set out and killed the dragon. The Priestess sent a secret drow force after them to enslave/kill the players and take the hoard. The players killed the drow, and with help from a resistance camp, attacked the drow army in the kingdoms castle. The players entered the castle to immedietly kill the Priestess, and after some poor strategic choices, the Priestess teleported out. She then went over to the dragons lair and saw the body...and casted Raise Dead on it.

0,0,7,1,"I’m a new DM planning a custom campaign setting, and I’m working on adapting the EverQuest class, Shadow Knight for it. Currently, what I have is pretty much a Paladin, but with LoH being inverted to do harm, which (oddly enough) they called Harm Touch. 

Some of my quandary is with how healing is “budgeted” vs. damage. LoH’s pool gains “points” at a rate of Paladin level * 5, but this rate is budgeted with healing and curing conditions in mind. Would it be fair to assume the rate of point accumulation could be higher, and remain relatively balanced, value-wise, if it were strictly a damaging ability?

My current thinking is to make it a damage dump on a 1/long rest basis. The idea being that the pool gets emptied in a reckless, devastating torrent of negative energy. (In the face, ideally.)

Modeling it on the cleric spell, Inflict Wounds, seems appropriate. I like that there is no save, so you won’t “blow the daily”, but base the damage portion on dice rolls, adding some variability. 

Would the ability ultimately scaling to, say, 10d10, once per long rest, be crazy? I don’t want to compare it to spells cast at 9th level, but maybe the level 14 Fiend Warlock ability Hurl Through Hell is a fair comparable? 

If so, what’s a fair starting point? 1d10 at 1st level, 1/LR?  

What about basing the scaling on d6? Everyone loves dishing out a handful of d6’s, but I like that it would make the results a bit more consistent on average, as well as making the pool progression a bit smoother. 

Also, I should probably say that keeping Divine Smite is negotiable. My plan was to maybe replace it with another aura or something as a concession to balancing against Harm Touch. 

TL;DR: How much damage is likely to be fair for a long rest feature designed to replace Lay on Hands?

Evocation magic can conjure fire, lightning, and acid to reduce something else from fine and fit to done and dust. Abjuration magic protects against attacks, be they magical or mundane. Then, we come to Divination.

Obviously, Divination magic allows one to see the then, the now, the soon, and the elsewhere; a diviner could be worth their literal weight in gold if they foresaw a conflict, or maybe how to *win* that conflict, for their patron lord. If they could track the skeins of mana to a location where a specific mcguffin is located, that could also be nice.

I want to introduce a seer into the campaign; an NPC who uses their magic to glimpse into the future, and proclaim for her general how upcoming battles will go, or how to change a foreseen defeat into a stunning victory. I've got stories where an Orc Warlord has a human seeress, and an emperor has a potent member of each tradition on pay, one of which is a seeress, but this one is actually going to appear in-game, so I don't know how PC diviners do this. Other than the typical fiat, are there actual divination spells that do this? It's sort of an underrepresented tradition, but then future sight is also a potent tool GMs might not want their powerful players to always have, and the future is always changing, or whatever.

For those that don't know, World of Warcraft has very few true deities, which is odd from a High Fantasy setting.

A big exception to this is Elune, the moon goddess of the Night Elves and maybe the 2nd/3rd most popular religion on Azeroth.  Recent events have led to confusion on what Elune actually is, but the relationship between Elune and her priestesses is very close to PF gods.

The Escape Artist skill allows you to wriggle your way out of grabs or bindings. The Escapologist rogue archetype lets you use it to:

Escapologist: 1/2 level to EA checks

Stealthy (feat): +2 to EA checks, +4 at later levels

Skill Focus (feat): +3 to EA checks, +6 at later levels

[Dislocate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dislocate/) (feat): Hurt yourself to lower time requirement on some EA checks. Eventually, you stop hurting yourself (good boi).

Signature Skill (feat): Just gives you a couple decent plusses to your EA skill like lowering time requirements and avoiding some effects before they happen.

Vagabond Child (Regional Trait): +1 to EA. Minor, but ~~who doesn't love a good~~ we like minor bonuses sometimes too. 

Start with a Dex of 17, get +2 from Ratfolk racial, pump that up with each level up because why not, so at level 20 you're looking at +7 there.



At this point, we're seeing a +13 to EA rolls at level 1, and a +61 to EA rolls at level 20. By level 3 we can already take 20 to get out of masterwork manacles (level one if you immediately go for Skill Focus). In 3.5, epic skill usage of EA allowed one to squeeze through a space smaller than one's own head at DC 80, and somehow friggin pass through a Wall Of Force at DC 120 (see [here](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm) for more of THAT kind of nonsense). Bear in mind, we haven't touched magic items yet. We should, but we won't in this OC. 

Other ideas of merit: 

Possessed Hand / Hand's Autonomy feats: The latter feat lets your hand act for you when you can't, sometimes. Here, it lets your hand roll any EA check for you at -4 if you couldn't already do it due to being unconscious, paralyzed, asleep, or stunned. This is now letting your demon hand force your body into contortions of both physical and mental (see Unfettered Mind) natures when you're otherwise preoccupied.

Sharptooth / Sharpclaw / Tunnel Rat / Burrowing Teeth feats: Leaning on the concept of Harry Houdini, you could go full disappearing act by learning how to tunnel on your own, too. Having a set of 3 natural weapons is already looking better than your Rogue-y BAB, just slap on a Weapon Finesse (via Finesse Rogue?) and now you've got a scrap-rat (heh). Getting out of jail is much easier when you don't need to Sleight Of Hand your weapons in! Just don't let them saw off your nat weps, mmkay? 

Skill Focus (Stealth) / Eldritch Heritage 1&amp;2 feats: Bit of a pricey feat dip here, but you have some good Stealth already so why not double dip when it comes to skills? The Shadow bloodline lets you get basically Hide In Shadow^TM with their 9th level ability, plus get 1-3/day shadowswappy Dimension Door shenanigans. Another step on the path to Houdinihood.

While under its effects, and while in combat, their body comes under incredible strain (taking 1 hp/level/turn), only relieved with the shedding of others' blood, which instead heals them (same, 1hp/level/turn).

That means that any fire spell can be a heal. While fun for blasters (half of uber optimized burning hands/scorching ray/fireball as healing), there is no clause that would protect the world from ""the healing cantrip"".

* Crossblooded into Elemental(fire) or Efreet to convert any damaging spell into fire
* Elemental spell metamagic + an appropriate trait

The spell used can be either disrupt undead (if you decide it is applicable as ""energy spell"") or a normal ray of frost/acid splash. The second option is better with blood havoc mutation (the 1lvl blood line power sucks so its no pain) + spell focus - to avoid healing 1/2 of 1 hit point.

That said, the little there is about it are the bloodrager bloodline and oracle archetype, which are immune to both good and bad effects of the liquid, and get a couple of slightly bad abilities related to shooting it via injuries; and a little trait that makes you immune only to the bad effects of drinking it, which is great if you ask me. But, since I already made a very nice necromancer for another game happening in Geb (bones oracle + 2 lvls of antipaladin + agent of the grave), I'm trying to come up with something else than yet necromancer, then what does that leave us with for this occasion?

First things first, what could a character be doing there? How did it arrive? What's his goal? How did he get the black blood running through its body to begin with? So far what i got is:

* A bloodrager with the said bloodline, who also has the aberrant one (crossblooded) for extra weirdness, but i still don't know what he's doing there. 
   * An experiment from a random Drow at the Bloodforge? Perhaps it was someone from Leng or a Neothelid instead? But then, how'd he get out of there to the ""starting town"" which may or may not be in orv or even the darklands? And why would he go back down there?
* Another bloodrager with the said bloodline, but this one has Eldritch Heritage with the Ghoul bloodline. 
   * This could be related to Geb, Nemret Noktoria or even Leng itself. A character can be made a ghoul (or ghast) from many reasons, of which some could be exposure to lazurite, getting done in by a marrowstone golem or more commonly dying from ghoul fever so there are many opportunities to also obtain the Ghoul Template (which sort of makes the sorcerer ghoul bloodline redundant there). So... what's next? What does he do with that? Usurp the leadership of ghouls and become ghoul king of sorts and conquer sekamina or a vault afterwards?
* A black blooded oracle... this one is a bit of a mystery, no pun intended, and disappointment. 
   * Oracles aren't very tanky HP-wise so they shouldn't be getting the injuries they need to shoot the black blood; other than that, more than half the stuff you can find down there are aberrations and undead, who are immune to it so what's the point? Also, oracle again... guess not.
* A Hallowed Necromancer wizard with the black blood heritage trait. For this i'd need to share this bit of information also from black blooded oracle:

&gt; Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source, losing all mystical properties. [*Gentle repose*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gentle-repose) can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood’s magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. 

* This guy is a diametrically opposite to most, if not all, things related to the darklands. Who wouldn't want a substance that increases necromancy-based cure spells to kill undead? There's the Cube of Writhing Glyphs too and wizards are supposed to be scholars, right? But would he go as far as going deep into orv for that? Is it worth it? Bearing in mind that I also already made an enervation build for a PC totally unrelated to this, what other necromancy spell could I even use? Are bad touch builds still a thing? 

And there ends my little list of things *directly* related to the black blood. What else can i do in that vault that's not directly related to it? 

* Fungi: It's a very common and popular thing on all the levels of the darklands, in this vault there's the Black Mire and the Hanging Forest. Possible characters: Fungal Pilgrim Druid and Blightseeker Alchemist.
* Demons: This vault is the particular location of the demonic cults to Abraxas and Camazotz (I'm not sure if there's anyone remaining of the latter though). Possible characters: Anyone who hates demons badly enough to go Jules Verne full throttle to kill them?
* ~~Cthulhu~~ Elder Mythos: A sea of unknown depth made of a mysterious substance and that seeps from the walls? Aquatic monsters, giant worms and other sort of aberrations lurking in the dark? Cult to Orgesh and faceless statues made by some unknown being? It is pretty self-explanatory, right? Although a bit broad and stretchy imho. Possible characters: Elder Mythos Scholar... and that's pretty much it since most other things cross the line into a ~~Jojo's~~ bizarre realm of insanity and paranoia ~~right next to uncle Sheogorath's islands,~~ which is sorta hard (but strangely fun) to RP and not easy to manage in a way that won't make you machinate the death of your party members for the glory of our lord and savior ~~Cthulhu~~ Orgesh.

I started by looking at the ability to simply increase healing done, and the one ability that does this well is the [Lesser Celestial Totem](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/celestial-totem-lesser-su/). This requires being a character with Rage Powers, and the Skald is really, really good at providing this Rage Power to all your allies. But I wasn't sure what spells would be effective with the Skald, so I started looking at its Spell List. That's when I saw the 2nd Level Spell: [Boiling Blood](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/boiling-blood/).

Now, unless I'm reading something incorrectly, if you are a Phoenix Bloodline Sorcerer 1/Skald X and you cast Boiling Blood, you can grant 1 ally for every 3 Skald Levels you have the ability to heal for your Skald's Caster Level each round by spending a Standard Action to Concentrate on the spell, or simply cast it to let it run for a number of rounds equal to your Skald's Caster Level.

I feel like this is a really, really effective combination. I know it's not gamebreaking and will still be out-DPRed by enemies, but it gives an Arcane caster an actual strong healing function at the cost of 1 level.

Currently I'm using a Witch with a rank in Knowledge (Religion), which is currently not a class skill.

Furthermore, when I go into further levels of Witch if I wanted to take a rank in a skill that's a class skill for the Bard and not the Witch (Stealth, for example), would that still get the +3 bonus because I already have the level in Bard, or not because I'm not taking that rank when taking a level in a class that doesn't have it as a class skill?

0,0,2,1,"We get it, a tiger druid deals more damage and is a better antimage, a summoner isn't limited only to dinosaurs and a shifter probably does better at becoming a war dinosaur.
But for this time, i really wanted to use a class based on my ever-obsession and love for dinosaurs.
Sadly, this is my first time ever building a Druid and i'm having more than just some random doubts, as Way of the Wicked gets merciless, i get to desire a more... optimized druid if i want to be more than just a magical dinosaur that screams at the ground to grow crops.

1. [what role?]

So, with the saurian shaman i get free sacred summoning (standard action instead of full round completion when summoning) on dinosaurs and reptiles.
As any druid, i get some good spells for either control, _downtime_ and somehow damage.
I have an animal companion (see you on point 2 and 3) and lastly, i get to be considered 2 levels higher for the wild shape, which at my level (7) is considered 9 if i turn into a dinosaur which gives me huge (both technically and effectively speaking) combat advantages, expecially with Grab and Rake on a pouncing juggernaut with a +6 strenght... scary!

So... what is my role? What should i fill my 5 feat slots with aside Wild Spells? Summoning 1 extra summon with 2 str and con by using 3 feats sounds a little underwhelming until i get to summon big bad creatures like ankylos or rexes (around Lv14? That's my level x2)... Should i focus more on my ability to buff and grab with feats like Dirty Fighter, Improved Grab and Greater Grab (even if, given the campaign theme i might be forced to fancy myself a player's familiar for sneaking)? Should i still pick those 3 feats to not be disturbed on higher levels? (Spell focus conjuration as a lv11 or 9th feat can sound _SO_ frustrating!)

2. [which pet to choose?]
Since i am forced by class to pick any kind of Dinosaur and the entire campaign is from 3rd party materials , (therefore out of official restrictions and bans) i was going to pick the infamous spinosaur, with his outstanding 15-19 CON and imposing 28  STR (at lv7!)
Is it wise to base my choice on the stats of the creature or should i pick something i like more such as a Giganotosaurus or a Tylosaurus? both have Grab, could try making it work as a tandem grab with my (potential) Grapple build (depending on question 1 ofc)

3. [what companion archetype?]
Looks like normal archetype is the best so far, but are there any archetypes doing better jobs with my companions? For example, the wrecker gets great anti-construct permanent buffs for a feat that i might get them later (or not, if the creature doesn't have many attacks!), a bodyguard might protect our blaster (considering they lose evasion makes me cringe knowing we have a BLASTER)  and healer (still, we have a blaster... and nothing really unallows me to just give it the feats once he reaches INT 3, a Bully might just have greater maneuvering options for potential tandem-grappling (i think i have to count as an orc for that or is there another feat helping?)
What's the general optimizing opinion on it?
Sorry, this is mostly tied to point 2 of ""what companion should i pick?""


4. [items]
This is a little bit more Mathfinder, but skipping the obvious mighty fists, mammoth helm, lesser Extend Rod, wis +X str +X or con +X We have the wild shape and armor issue: the armor either costs too much (+4 bonus is a crime!), i can't wear it (no heavy armor proficiency) or it becomes useless as i switch between Huge to Tiny (luckily enough, we have places where to store it if i don't wear it)
So, the question is Stone Plate Barding (low cost... somehow?) or waiting for Wild Stone Plate? (Unfairly expensive with the +3 from wild, that requires a blood tribute of +1 armor so, complexively +4 armor... but once i wear it, i use it even when going at the toilet! Hell, i'm getting a wand of Iron Bed just for it!)
Right now, a stone plate with my Huge form looks just the best i could ask for since the enemy hits hard (because of the strong composition, all enemies have the Advanced template), and money are valuable for a Druid that is still in need of hos bag of seeds!!!

5. [Traits]
Druids have the best tricks: wild shape for double the amount of time if i disguise myself into a familiar (compsognathus, tuatara or rhamphoryncus and so on...) to sneak into civilized places? Calling animals CR8 to train and use to fight the forces of oppressive good? (We're an evil campaign!) but what if Call Animal didn't just really work? Like, right now we have an entire wood without a single animal because it's a desecrated land... and our DM is... kinda well known to dislike cheesing via silly buggy tricks such as gifted adept (call animal)
Considering Question 1 (role) and question 4 (items), are these good traits? Taking the form of a tiny familiar kills both the whole allosaurus-line of feats and the stoneplate non-wild-armor barding... anything else besides Reactionary?

Please, forgive my wall of text full of interruptions, i really just want to not be disappointed by this class that, in many years just seemed like the ultimate dinosaur-based class (with the pets restrictions or class restrictions, many nice martial classes just really feel wasted as Dinosaur-flavouring... not as much as Druid, i mean!), thanks for the patience of reading... and please go easy on me &gt; ^ &lt;);",Pathfinder_RPG,Please help - Dinosaur Based Druid first time!

I know my husband and thousands upon thousands of people love it though, so I have to wonder if there is something that I am missing. I’ve decided to share some of my concerns here in the hopes that you fine people can help me see how these things are addressed in game mechanics or how DMs handle them in a good way. 

Stat damage/Losing a level – These two things seem like a very feel bad mechanic to me. 

I understand that in some situations these penalties are temporary, but not all of them. My main concern is that these types of mechanics seem like they would lead to a ‘death spiral.’ You fail a save, take stat or level reduction, which makes it harder for you to pass saves to either remove the damage or prevent further damage of this type. Rinse, repeat a couple times and you have gimped/useless or dead PCs.   

Move Actions – I have not been able to wrap my head around some of these. Most of them make sense, but on the whole move actions seem very restrictive. My brain just rejects the idea that a character can’t draw a weapon while walking towards an enemy. My wizard can’t fire an orison, grab a piece of paper off a desk he’s next to, then move a few feet on his turn? Grabbing a piece of paper makes it so the PC can’t move? Is this game mechanic designed this way for balance of action economy? If that is the case it seems narritively terrible ☹ 

Overall Deadly – so I’m reading through RotRL and really liking the story. Then, I come to the part 4 of book 2: Misgivings. This place seems designed to straight up kill PCs. Haunts dealing wisdom, strength, charisma damage- or that can straight up kill a PC for failed saves, multiple chances to contract Vorel’s Phage or Ghoul Fever. I'm not sure how the players are supposed to actually survive all this.

During my We Be Goblins game, I am certain if I had stuck strictly to the move action rules that the game would have been a tpk during the Vorka fight, despite good tactics on the part of the players.

Is Pathfinder simply a deadlier system than I am used to? Are PC deaths a common/expected thing?

Please understand, I’m not trying to pooh-pooh Pathfinder as a system. These are real concerns I have about these mechanics leading to playing a game that is just not fun. As such I am looking for insight into the system and how these things are handled. Thank you all for your time.",Pathfinder_RPG,Please help me like Pathfinder

0,0,32,277,"I'm running a campaign with four paladin PCs called **SMITE EVIL**. They started at 3rd level - all riding up to the same crossroads at the same time - and currently the party is 18th level, adventuring inside Rovagug's cage. This past Sunday, I experienced one of those moments where things are so absurd they become awesome.

Apologies for purists about PF canon.

Let me begin with the setting.

For the sake of my game, I decided that **Rovagug**'s greatest power is that he consumes divinity. Any god in his presence is rendered mortal. If he strikes a mortal, he temporarily severs them from the ability to use or receive divine magic. It was basically impossible for the gods to kill him, because every god he killed just made him stronger. Instead of slaying him, they sealed him away in the cage in the center of Golarion. There he sleeps, and his dreams of destruction manifest as a landscape of long-dead worlds constantly being torn apart.

Though Rovagug is trapped in slumber, every once in a while a god dies on the surface of Golarion, and Rovagug draws some of that god's essence into the cage with him. If he gets enough strength, he might awaken and break free of his cage, which is why the gods generally aren't reckless enough to meddle in mortal affairs.

Another thing I added is that Asmodeus locked a legion of loyal devils inside the cage to keep tabs on the Rough Beast. They are commanded by an archdevil who had once been a duke of hell - **Egal the Shimmering**, whose purview is greed, mercenaries, and creators of magnificent treasure.

https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/738/581/large/eleni-tsami-medea.jpg?1431942393

The party had a long road getting here, and the whole tale is more complicated than is necessary to explain for this story. Suffice it to say, they're trying to rescue some innocents and stop some villains, and this next session, the world might end. 

But first, they kitted up with tons of magic items to deal with whatever they might find, and entered the cage. During a few days of exploring, they encounter remnants of long-dead gods, whose essence was pulled into the cage. They have a harrowing experience talking down **Dou-Bral** as he's trapped in a cycle slowly going mad and turning into **Zon-Kuthon** every few days. They find a shattered metal angel with a halo like an angry red eye (our play group previously played through the **Iron Gods** adventure path). They find a hollow mummy of **Ptah**, one of the Osirioni gods who never made it over from the Egyptian pantheon.

In Ptah's tomb, they found a lich named **Sorvab** who pitifully asked to die. Our Shelynite paladin, **Thaddeus**, took mercy on the thing and learned that Sorvab had once been a mortal man on a truly ancient world that Rovagug destroyed before he ever came to Golarion. Sorvab had created a minor artifact that was both a *mirror of life trapping* and a *mirror of opposition*. Made of polished gold, it would consume the soul of anyone who touched it and replace their soul with one of a diametrically opposed alignment. It could only hold one soul at a time.

He had offered it as a gift to Egal the Shimmering, hoping to get Hell's assistance in saving his world. Instead, Egal tested the mirror on Sorvab, creating a loyal minion, whom he commanded to become a lich so he could serve forever. When Rovagug threatened Golarion and Asmodeus set Egal to the task of controlling the inside of the cage, Sorvab came too. He lacked the mindless discipline of the devils, so he started to go mad and deserted, fleeing into a distant spot in the nightmarish landscape within the cage. Now he simply wanted to die, to have his phylactery destroyed, because he was convinced he would never escape.

Thaddeus offered instead to recover the mirror and restore Sorvab's soul, and perhaps make him alive again. 

To reach the people they wanted to rescue, the paladins would have to make it past the Golden Legion anyway, and so Tad hoped he would find the mirror in their fortress. When they approached the fortress, they were met by a messenger carrying a big cauldron of gold coins. He poured them out, and they levitated, forming Egal the Shimmering's face. To the party's surprise, Egal said he didn't care if they went any further, as long as they didn't interfere with Asmodeus's plans: namely, don't free Rovagug.

Since apparently a fight wasn't going to happen, Tad asked if maybe they could buy something from him. A bit of bartering later, and the party trades a few hundred thousand GP worth of stuff for the mirror. With surprisingly little fanfare, they let Sorvab touch the mirror, which obliterates his lich body and replaces it with his mortal body and his original, not-evil soul. 

Riding high on their victory (and high on their horses), the paladins travel past the fortress of the golden legion to their ultimate destination, a palace that holds a prisoner they intend to rescue. Here's where I make a silly error.

They find a sword on the ground with a green crystal blade, and beside it a cracked statue of an imposing man with Azlanti features. They realize this is a fragment of Aroden. Whatever may have killed him, a piece of him ended up here.

I'm just thinking, hey, this will be a fun bit of mystery, because they'll know Aroden is dead, but still won't know why. It's a big part of the setting, and even now, the answer is hidden from them.

The paladin of Ra, **Akhenra**, pipes up that he has a *scroll of true resurrection*, which works as long as the person died in the past 170 years. Aroden died 111 years ago.

Someone points out that he's not just dead; he's petrified.

Don't worry, says Akhenra. My *lay hands* can cure petrification through a mercy.

I decide at that point that one of the things Asmodeus definitely doesn't want is Aroden coming back, even as a mortal, to make trouble. So the Golden Legion starts lopping trebuchet buckets of lava at the party, which arc for a few miles and start landing around them. They are not deterred, however, and restore Aroden from petrification, then abscond with his body to a safe distance, at which point they revive him. He has lost his divine powers, but he's still, like, canonically a very high level spellcaster, and I figure he's wished himself to have super high stats.

Of course they ask him how he died. So I kinda broke a cardinal rule of the PF setting by answering that. Oops?

He's disturbingly *not* selfless, but he's certainly got a grudge against Hell. So they make a plan to storm the Golden Legion's fortress.

The crux of that plan is this. Aroden disguises everyone with *invisibility* and *mind blank* from a distance, they fly into Egal's throne room with flight magic on their steeds and such, and then they kick ass. A group of 20th level paladins do a *number* on a throne room filled with high-level devils -- Akhenra solos a pit fiend over the span of two turns, Thaddeus and his horse both with Combat Reflexes tear apart a phalanx of bearded devils, our archer **Marthel** kills some invisible horned devils, and so on. 

And then there's Egal the Shimmering, with basically the statblock of CR 25 Amon, Duke of Hell (3rd party - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc), plus I added some special powers like conjuring a treasure hoard avalanche, and greedily copying any spells other casters use around him. The fiend is exceptionally powerful. But even exceptionally powerful dukes of hell can fail saving throws.

So when the rest of the party is distracting him, Egal doesn't notice Aroden run up beside him, take the golden mirror like a two handed bludgeon, and bonk the archdevil in the face. One shitty saving throw later, and the party has a freshly minted Chaotic Good empyreal lord on their side.

So you run a session....were you play as the Companions!

With threats and puzzles uniquely suited to each companion.  A gauntlet run with the companions riding on the Cavalier's horse's back.  A quick combat for the Animal Companion and Eidelon to shine while playing escort to the flimsy familiar. A puzzle room where the tiny familiar must navigate the smallest of tunnels to get through into rooms filled with levers impossible to reach for their bigger allies.

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively: You play a mission where your not necessarily lost, but must keep your bumbling PC's from doing the incredibly stupid nonsense they would ordinarily do while still winning the day.

The boss had some custom mechanics (similar to legendary/lair actions in 5E or boss mechanics in video games) and while I try to telegraph stuff, I don't think that's going to work 100% of the time.  Either I won't make it as clear in-game as it needs to be or the players will misread the situation or both.  The question then is how to handle the resulting TPK (or at least near TPK).

&amp;#x200B;

I think we need to decide on some general principles going forward.  Without risk of death/loss, I feel the game has less meaning.  On the flip side, if there's, say, four boss fights per level and you succeed 95% of the time, that's likely several more TPKs by the end of the campaign (this is assuming you never die to lesser encounters which technically could also happen).  There's at least three main options: 

&amp;#x200B;

1, ""IT WAS ALL A DREAM!"" I don't really like this option, I think it cheapens death and makes failing meaningless.

&amp;#x200B;

2, reset but with consequences.  people have mentioned the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor.  In this case it would probably be something like the encounter you just wiped to getting a small boost across the board while you get a second chance.  If you die again, it gets boosted more.  if this happens a few times it's going to become impossible and it becomes a TPK.  So you get a few chances but that's it -- and it's a bit harder each time.

&amp;#x200B;

3, TPKs are TPKs.  If the party is wiped out, that's that.  New party (or if one person escaped then most of a new party or whatever).

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the concern here is also disruption of plotlines.  If one person dies (falls into lava and there's nothing left to rez, let alone raise dead) then that can already disrupt stuff and that's ""good"" because death should be meaningful...but it's a far cry short of jettisoning every NPC connection/character arc and resetting with a new party.

TL/DR: My players insist on being diplomats instead of dungeon divers and have begun bribing a grindylow to help them bribe other grindylow with alcohol. And bluff their leader into thinking the grindylow have an army.

The set-up is that my players are about halfways through the first book still. They have finished checking out the town, found the choker caves while investigating Levin Farm and cleared that out right then and there, took their boat back to meet up with the rest of the colonists instead of hiking there, which caused them to skip the incutilis and finding the jack warden trail. They defused the boat situation expertly, and instead of immediately dealing with the grindylows they sailed back to the colony and rested up before heading back to the cave, which is where we started the session. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because we are short a PC I started them at level 2, and they were still level 2 going into the grindylow cave. In the entrance to the cave they take out 2 grindylows in under 1 round, stabilize them both, and the Paladin decides she wants to parley with the clan instead of committing genocide. Luckily the Gillman Archaeologist speaks aquan and can communicate, so he gets things rolling. They come to an agreement with one of the grindy's (which we named Groose after the zelda character) that he would go with them if they gave him grog and supported his claim for chieftain if/when Brinetooth dies. They spend the next 2 hours of real time talking to Groose and Ramona arranging the best way to ally themselves with the grindylow tribe and trying to put together a suitable gift for the grindylow chieftain. And due to a very good bluff roll (on the Paladin's part of all characters!) Ramona now thinks that hundreds of grindylow surround the island/colony. I had to end the session there because I have no solid idea how to proceed with this.

0,0,6,7,"My players are currently going through RoTR campaign. I am reading one of the encounters from the Hook Mountain book and came accross the Shocker Lizard's. This room has 12 shocker lizards in it.

Bestiary 1 PG 248 states:
&gt;*Shock (Su) Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock
to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8
points of nonlethal electricity damage to living
opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). This save DC
is Constitution-based. Additionally, if
two or more shocker lizards are within
20 feet of each other, they can work
together to create a lethal shock once
every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a
radius of 20 feet, centered on any
one contributing lizard. All creatures
within that radius take 2d8 points
of lethal electricity damage for each
lizard contributing to the shock, to
a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save
(DC 10 + the number of lizards
contributing) halves the damage.*

On the first Lizard's first turn does he activate this attack and then all the Lizards turns are skipped because he used this attack? Or would it be more like all the lizards aid the last lizard and he activates it? 
Or do all the lizards get separate attacks? Or do I for that one round have them attack as though they were a swarm? I am unsure how this works.

####Appearance

Ornate armor covers this hulking creature, rocky protrusions jutting from its hide and fierce horns crowning its broad head.
  

####CR   20
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Gargantuan
####Special Abilities  

Armor Training (Ex) An akvan is created wearing armor, and is naturally experienced in its use. An akvan possesses the armor training ability of a 15th-level fighter.

Aura of Hopelessness (Su) All creatures except divs within 30 feet of an akvan must make a successful DC 30 Will save or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Create Ghul (Su) Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Shake Faith (Su) Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Torturous Gullet (Su) As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan’s stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well.

Akvans seek out wonders to destroy—monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan’s evil does not end with its victim’s death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield—or are belched up from an akvan’s gullet—as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves.

Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile.

Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds.
Akvan Princes
As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes.

Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4–8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22­–24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts.

Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish.

Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains resist fire 30, an efreeti’s heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like abilities: at will—quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day—wish.

Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will—invisibility; 3/day—gaseous form, wish.

Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid’s water’s fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like abilities: constant—water breathing, water walk; at will—quickened control water; 3/day—horrid wilting, wish.

Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity 20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will—ethereal jaunt, invisibility; 3/day—insanity, mage’s disjunction, wish.

0,0,4,3,"When making an app to a game you may be really excited about this character idea you had, maybe you found some REALLY COOL art and your super excited to make that particular character and go in and have a good time.  And there's nothing wrong with that, the point of this post isn't to tell you not to do that because you should.

&amp;#x200B;

But what you should do is take a look at what the token art the other PCs are using is and use that to temper your expectations or even determine if that game is right for you before you even post an Player App in the LFG.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you found this art of a grizzled barbarian warrior drawn in a hyper realistic style and it's cool and you love it....but maybe it's not the right thing for the game of Magical Girl Princess Power. The inverse also being true, I've had dozens and dozens of people post 12 year old anime girls to the LFG pages of my dark gothic horror games. And maybe those apps are REALLY GREAT CHARACTERS that I want in my game very much and maybe the players are the best around, but seeing this Loli nestled in with dour steampunk oil stained hardarses just....well it draws me out and makes me warry of that character. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it doesn't even have to be a tonal thing. You maybe love drawing your own tokens but your art skills are.....not quite there yet. It can unintentionally give a bad impression when you post this stick figure in with the group of guys who spent a couple hundred dollars each to have their tokens custom made by professional artists. 

&amp;#x200B;

and then there's sexual content, Maybe you think that loin clothed, pasties on her boobs, elf wench is really awesome, but maybe the group just isn't really going for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make isn't "" Your wrong to post that "" my point isn't "" Lol Anime sucks get it out of here "" rather the point I want to make is that pictures speak a thousand words and when I see your token, more so than alot of your backstory is going to color my impression of your character and you as a player and when I'm sifting through a dozen applications that can make a very big difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this goes both ways also! Maybe you want that anime ninja character or that guy who's got a flaming sword and armor and glowing eyes and lightning bolt cape at level 1. Looking at the token art other people post can give you a good impression if it's worth posting in that LFG, See a bunch of other Anime portraits? Your gonna feel right at home! Nobody likes being the odd man out afteral.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course there are also GM's and groups who just dont' care so dont' take any of this as law or the gospel truth, just something to consider if you find your having trouble getting into games and need every little edge you can get. If your patient you will ALWAYS find a game that suits you perfectly and doing what's fun is always the best policy when it comes to tabletop gaming, be yourself and you'll find the right group eventually!",Pathfinder_RPG,New Player Advice: Token Art leaves a BIG impression.

If you are currently in the Rise of the Runelords campaign with Nicolas, Etrigan, John Wood, and Dr. Keel, kindly read no further.

My players are on chapter 5 of Rise of the Runelords, and have recently entered &gt;!the Runeforge demiplane!&lt;. As described in the book, 

&gt;!""Runeforge follows many of the “rules” of the Material Plane as if the complex were still a part of it. Gravity works the same,
time passes at the same rate, and there are no dominant
planar traits....Runeforge sustains those within its walls
constantly, keeping them nourished and reviving the
body and mind. No creature needs to eat, drink, or
sleep in Runeforge, except for pleasure. (Spellcasters
are still limited to once per day when replenishing
their spellcasting potential, even though they do not
need to sleep beforehand.)!&lt;

Now, with this in mind, one of my dearly beloved party members is a Lycanthrope (long story), and it was four days until the Full Moon (when he is going to go full bestial, wild, and dangerous) when they entered.

Or will the party be safe from his feral rage while on a different &gt;!plane from the moon!&lt;?",Pathfinder_RPG,Question about Lycanthropy
0,0,13,5,"New to Pathfinder! My group of friends is trying it out to see how we like it, and I've decided to make a character inspired by Dante (from the Devil May Cry series.png) using the Synthesist Summoner. As you can imagine with all of the required reading and lack of experience, I'm having a hard time deciding on the fine details of my build and would like some guidance. I'm not looking to make the most optimized character or a 1:1 rendition of Dante, just something conceptually close: a fun loving melee combatant with a huge sword, a devil trigger, and a handful of tricks up his sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've decided on Demon Spawn Tiefling for my race. My GM is allowing me to trade in some stuff to get that trait that lets Tieflings wield larger weapons. With 20 point buy my stats pre-racials are 14 12 12 7 14 16 in that order. Also of note, since I have no interest in actually summoning anything aside from my refluffed Eidilon, my GM has allowed me to trade out access to summoning spells as well as the Summon Monster SLA for extra feats when I would otherwise upgrade Summon Monster. Not sure how (un)balanced that is, but it seemed the simplest solution.

&amp;#x200B;

The two areas I'm most uncertain of is how high of an emphasis I need to place on my charisma score, and also the main form of attack for my fused state. I don't plan to cast much outside of utility and buff spells, so I imagine I don't need my charisma score all that high; however, I'm unfamiliar with the system as a whole so I don't know if there's a reason I shouldn't leave my charisma sitting around 18. As for modes of attack, I'm definitely going biped with manufactured weapons and at least one big sword. My initial conception was having four arms to two hand a greatsword while also having two free hands for casting, but I'm also considering wielding x number of greatswords. I can't picture my devil trigger state having a ton of arms, and I'm not even sure how effective that is in the first place, so insight is appreciated.

0,0,59,17,"Sorry for the following rant, just something that bothers me pretty hard.

&amp;#x200B;

My GM is pretty good and we can talk with him about a lot of things. Except fumble rules. Got him to at least have a confirmation roll for attack fumbles because otherwise my ranger would be dead by level 7 by killing himself with an arrow through his throat or, as already happened, by cutting into my own leg with my axe. I'm ok with that, still hurts builds needing weapons or attack rolls more but I can live with that.  


What I just don't like is that he wants to have fumbles for skill checks, without confirmation, because otherwise there ""wouldn't be so many fumbles"". That lead to my ranger lvl 3, sneak bonus of +9, to yell for my bow in the midst of the night (Nat 1, instead of just getting it ready with stealthiness of 10) while 4 goblins were under our tent ""city"" in the trees. Since the skill check fumble rate will always be a flat 5 %, regardless of being a commoner or a lvl 20 master hunter,  I'm looking for builds that either aren't subject to these rules that let me feel like a dumbass trying to do heroic things as often or something else to mitigate these effects in any way.  


I will definitely bring it up next time at the full table that it bothers me, including me deciding for my character that he was ordered home for orc-reasons (dwarf) if this rule will stay. I would like to play a character that I can get invested to, that's why I'm looking for builds/guides/tips/tricks/whatever to not fail miserably 5 % of the times. I have no problem with failing at all, that can be fun as well, but failing miserably every 20th time isn't as heroic as I would like to play. It just isn't fun for me (at least my GM has fun describing it). Otherwise I will play the human fighter John Doe the I.

0,0,1,1," With Pathfinder 2.0 coming up as the the main focus, I thought I'd take a shot at getting some questions answered over the blade adept, especially after playing it for a while.

There is a lot of argument on how the blade adept works.

So here goes (Please note that this is not in terms of PFS but home games):

1) The blade adept's black blade cannot be enhanced, like the magus's black blade, correct? This is despite this being a bonded object? This is to avoid an enhancement issues for game mechanics, correct?

2) Does the black blade maintain any enhancement prior to becoming a black blade?

3) The arcanist's arcane reservoir replaces the magus's arcane pool. How is the arcane reservoir points calculated? 3 + arcanist level or 1/3 arcanist level + intelligence (because of the black blade feature)?

4) The magus feature is described as the arcane pool. If the arcanist's reservoir replaces the arcane pool, can the arcanist use the reservoir to enhance the black blade like how the magus can enhance the black blade?  The black blade has it's own arcane pool.  Can you use it to enhance the black blade?

5) Why pick blade adept over vmc magus? They appear to have roughly the same amount of tradeoffs and benefits. For every increase to the black blade, vmc magus can also enhance the weapon, but do it better and with any weapon. The lost feats were likely to be spent on metamagic or item creation, which can be acquired through the arcanist exploits you saved.

Basically, from what I've seen:

Blade adept:   
\- 3 exploits   
\- Eldritch Blade   
\- Spell Strike

VMC Magus:   
\- 3 exploits (metamagic)   
\- Broad Study   
\- Trade in for Spell Strike   
\- No sentient weapon bonuses - Trade for familiar?

Both of these allow me to get Arcane Accuracy which was the biggest appeal to me.

Accurate strike from VMC is also pretty appealing.  

I can see giving up spellstrike to reduce the cost of the archetype.  ",Pathfinder_RPG,Blade Adept Arcanist Q's

While I'm not playing, I devise plans to save my party's butt from different situations, and today's disaster is ""everyone is down, i'm the only person up"".

 My first instinct as an Arcanist is to nope the hell out of there with my companions, so Dimensional Slide, Swift Action Bloodline Development Vestige Bloodline to use a bound item to cast Teleportation to get me and my friends to a safe place.

While this is the main plan, I doubt everyone in going to be in range of my teleportation spell (the paladin and the warrior might be 20 fts apart from each other), and so I asked myself, if I use a Reach Metamagic Rod (or the feat), does it increase the range of people I can teleport from Touch to Close? Or is the Teleportation range that gets increased? By RAW I would say the first since the ""range"" is ""personal and touch"", but later the spells specify that there is need of contact between the targets.

Edit: I'll add that the Reach Spell feats specify that you can't apply it to spells that lack the range of Touch, Close or Medium, and since the Teleport ""travel range"" is none of these, I suspect that you can't increase it with said feat, leaving the ""personal and touch"" the only increasable part, but the need of contact still confuses me.

Eventually things calm down and all the saved people vouch for the party so the guards pardon them and let them go. At this point the party introduces themselves to each other and go get drink in a tavern for shenanigans. 

The wizard checks his items he stole and discovers a bag of gold, a bag of uncut gems, and a bag of magic dust for an unknown use. But he also notices that there is also ordinary sand in the bag. So he goes off to the shop he stole it from and blackmails the shopkeep into buying his silence for conning people. 

We take a short break around this time because I expected the prison break to take longer and have to plan some on the fly shit now. 

We come back from the break and one of them suggests talking to the captain of the guard about the raid. They discover through some rp that this is a common occurrence and the raiders are in fact slavers who kidnapped the blacksmith's daughter. 

After talking to the blacksmith and another guard they get the girl's description and a possible location for the slavers. 

Next they decide to gather supplies for the trip so they go and visit that shopkeeper that the wizard stole from earlier. After a bit of rp and haggling they get some legitimate supplies and head off to the cave. 

They get to the cave and there are two slavers keeping watch. They develope a plan and it almost works. But then everything went wrong. The rogue missed the sneak attack, the illusionists spell failed, and the excleric couldn't get in fast enough with their heavy armor.

Now the baddies inside are definitely aware of the attackers and I've got some plans for the inside of the cave which I will run them through next week. ",Pathfinder_RPG,Just finished first session of my campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that she has been Aldern's obsession. He started out being a bit too clingy to her and inappropriately giving her all the credit for saving him. They chose not to go on the boar hunt as they had a feeling he was creepy and it was a trap. After that though he left a gift of a masterwork composite longbow for her when he left and has not returned. I have played up small items of hers having gone missing as well... but no one really seemed to notice for too long as other events just kept occuring. During the downtime between adventures she even talked about maybe looking him up... she had definitely come to think of him more fondly when nothing bad had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

With her leaving I am really disappointed both that all of that foreshadowing and setup went in to setting her up as the perfect target of his obsession as well as now having lost the opportunity to make it be whomever I am going to have to target next... just bummed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... other suggestions? I hate killing off a character after their player leaves the game, but it seems that Aldern letting his obsession get to him might be the perfect thing. She just goes missing and no one knows where she is. When they get to the mansion they see painting that look almost just like her (she described her character very similar to what Iesha looks like in the art)... then they find her body when they get down stairs to finally confront Aldern along with the table holding all of the little curious of hers he had acquired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another possibility that occurred to me was actually replacing Iesha with her. She had a whirlwind romance after the last adventure, got married and things played out very similarly. Not sure I like this though as it messes with the timeline and opens a lot of questions... like why the PCs weren't invited to any wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I need to pick a new obsession. I have never liked the non-lust options as much and especially with no time to prep any foreshadowing... I am more at a loss of how to proceed. I suppose it could be fun to try and frame one of the characters for the murders as time goes on... maybe the low RP halfling cavalier.

0,0,12,1,"Been playing my first Pathfinder character (void-touched halfling sorcerer), and we just hit Level 8 while playing the Emerald Spire.

I've been extensively researching my spell choices online and as the game has progressed I find myself drifting away more and more from some universally praised choices like Fireball, Stinking Cloud, and Stone Call. Black tentacles is in reach now but I just don't see myself taking it, despite how great it sounds. It just feels like a waste of a slot when I'm unlikely to have a good opportunity to cast it without hitting my allies.

My party (monk, ranger, rogue, bard) has pretty high initiative, and while mine is up among the highest, more often than not at least one ally is in the way of AoE when my turn comes. Worse still, the Spire in general seems like a pretty cramped place. Usually when combat starts, we're already too close to the enemy for a fireball or a cloud, even if I asked whoever is ahead of me to delay.

That's not to say I never use AoEs. Early on I got a few good color sprays off. And there was one boss encounter I managed to launch a fireball from a scroll to good effect. But nine times out of ten, it just ain't happening. Because of this, I find myself taking more targeted spells like Burning Arc, Slow, and Icy Spears and not picking up Fireball, Stinking Cloud, or Black Tentacles. I've had Web for a few sessions but still haven't had a good chance to use it.

Now, I'm not complaining per say. I don't have any regrets (other than not realizing how many more spells I would know if my PC were human). I'm pretty happy with my spell choices and our party has been doing well. **I'm just curious why my experience seems so different than most I've read.**

My dilemma is that I'm not sure about how to approach the game with them. I have written two brief intro adventures that will give me the option of doing either:

1) Giving the players a choice of pre-gen characters, including background story, character traits, objectives etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Giving them blank slate characters that are basically 'fresh souls' in story terms and have no experiential memories (although their bodies retain some 'muscle memory' that explains their skills/knowledges/abilities etc - there is then future RP potential for discovering who their body was via physical characteristics (tattoos, being recognised, etc) that becomes part of the story). This lets me, as GM, guide them in situations in a more seamless, narrative way (ie, something tells you that you could probably balance across this narrow ledge etc).

The basic concept is that you take a half-orc or orc archer(doesn't seem to matter a huge deal what the base class is) and through use of other character buffs or item buffs you make something truly disgusting.   


First step is to give our monstrosity a Orc Hornbow(2d6). Step 2 is to cast enlarge person on him, he becomes large sized, and so with his new size his bow would go up to a Large sized Orc Hornbow(3d6). Through further magic, we apply the Gravity bow spell and now the Large Orc Hornbow counts as one size larger for damage(4d6). I am pretty certain at this point we are still RAW, however we can go further and I am wondering if this crosses the line.  


If our Orc siege weapon here were to get an enchantment of Growing Weapon on his bow, then we are looking at a Large Orc Hornbow, that for 10 minutes a day he can make a Huge Orc Hornbow(6d6) and use without penalty. If we want to get even more wonky the Orc Archer could use a Large Hornbow from the get go, sure he takes a -2 but think of the pay off when we apply all our buffs and the final result is a Large Orc wielding a Huge Growing Orc Hornbow with gravity bow on top of it for 8d6 per arrow.

#####

####Ecology  

Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobra-like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds.

While many guardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder—towering waterfalls, natural spires, mountaintop temples—minding them out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder’s charge.

I've been thinking that the less powerful, and more innovative mages and crafters would eventually create a line of magic items for the everyday man.  Something that would make their lives easier, but wouldn't be of much use to most adventurers.

The campaign is set in Andoran, and my idea what that the system is programmed to defend Andorans values of common liberty and equality, and sees the current Supreme Elect and the corrupt politics of the nation as a threat to those values. I'm drawing inspiration from the movie [Eagle Eye](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059786/): the system organizes a massive coup d'etat that would kill a lot of the heads of state, until the calculated ""best candidate for the government"" is the next in line of succession. In the campaign, the system would be pushing tensions within Andoran (provoking fighting to build the people into an anti-government fervor), before sparking an event that will murder the Supreme Elect and his sympathizers.

Trouble is, I'm trying to find the ways to mechanically represent this system. I'm thinking of an AI system from the Technology Guide, but Andoran isn't a high-tech setting, and I'm hoping to build something that's more based on magic than computers. Perhaps the system has control of an army of constructs.

0,0,158,152,"[Vital strike](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat/) isn't exactly bad so much as it is a victim of its own coolness.

&amp;#x200B;

The feat theoretically has a niche fulfilling a specific fantasy, that of the powerful warrior who finishes off foes [in a single blow](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F20KSmo8aJ7HYu5L0rf%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;f=1). You don't need a second hit--one is enough. It's pretty badass if you can pull it off.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend Bob sees the feat and he thinks ""wow, I'd love to make a character centered around that!"" Bob proceeds to use the feat chain as a build-around. He goes out of his way to find the largest possible weapons, invests in the whole feat chain, picks up other feats to support the strategy, and then spends every possible round of combat vital-striking.

&amp;#x200B;

This build is bad bad bad. A vital strike is not as good as a full-attack action in most cases. Bob gets screwed over by effects like *blur* or *mirror* image. There will be turns when Bob naturally rolls low on the d20, effectively loses all his attacks for the turn, and feels bad. And even if Bob hits, the payoff isn't really there; it probably doesn't deal more damage per round than a full attack even in the best case scenario. The feat simply isn't good enough to support an entire character concept.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's secretly a great utility feat. Rather than making it a build-around, you can slap it onto martial characters for circumstantial value.

&amp;#x200B;

The first use for the feat is mobility. Combat in Pathfinder typically rewards martial characters for planting their feet and full-attacking. And one of the advantages that casters have over warriors is the ability to cast their spell for the round and then move, getting the most out of their action economy without compromising their effectiveness. Vital strike stretches out your action economy, allowing you to move without missing out on the entire value of a full attack. If moving and then attacking is two actions, think of moving and then using a vital strike as 2.5 actions.

&amp;#x200B;

How to benefit from the mobility? Finish off an injured enemy and then start moving on to the next one. Use it instead of a charge action, to deal more damage when the enemy has low AC, or when the terrain doesn't allow charging. Walk around the enemy's cover and then shoot them with a vital strike musket ball. Or hit a powerful enemy and then walk away to bait out its AoO for the turn.

&amp;#x200B;

The second use is damage reduction. Ideally you'd get around DR by using the correct weapons. But sometimes you won't have a silver holy bullet when you entered the dungeon prepared to fight fairies, and found devils instead. That's ok--vital strike is naturally good against DR.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, vital strike can be great for the surprise round. The goal of a good ambush is to end the battle before it begins, but this is often difficult in Pathfinder. Sometimes there are low-HP, high-value targets who need to die in a single round. Sentries will survive the first hit and raise an alarm, or wizards will survive and teleport away. Vital strike isn't a silver bullet to this problem, but it helps. You can't take a full attack action in the surprise round anyway, so vital strike can be another way to turn your one standard action into 1.5 standard actions. Some characters like rangers or slayers may be able to creep all the way up into melee before combat begins. Archers and gunslingers may get off a vital strike shot from concealment before combat begins. If you have a stealthy martial character, consider taking this feat.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

&amp;#x200B;

**The best thing about vital strike** is that it can be made to do a lot of work for a small investment. Picking up a single feat (or maybe two, if you're a fighter with feats to spare) is enough to generate value in a wide variety of circumstances. Just be sure you use it judiciously, and not as your main mode of attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**The worst thing about vital strike** is that it doesn't do a very good job of supporting the fantasy that it represents. Bob will probably never chop a pit fiend in half with one blow, and he'll sacrifice a lot of power in the futile quest to do so. He may land OHKOs on weak enemies, but it won't support an entire character concept the way that he wants it to, unless he plays at a really-power table.",Pathfinder_RPG,Vital strike discussion (inspired by trap option thread)

I'm going to be running it in a few weeks but I'm a bit concerned it's going to be hard to wrap up well. We'll only have a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

The plot is that a wizard shows up at your village looking for adventurers to test 300 ""glitchy"" wands of magic missile and is willing to pay you 1000 gold each to do so. To tidy up the use-magic-item plothole, I'm going to be saying they're prototypes designed to be used by the magically unskilled knights of the kings army, which also explains why they're glitchy. Each of the batch has been made with slightly different techniques and they want to find the method that works best. They came out here to find patriotic citizens away from potential spies who'll do this job for the good of the realm (expendable peasants far away from anything valuable who'll ask no questions when confronted with piles of gold).

&amp;#x200B;

There's a mineshaft full of gnolls to get them started with some ready test subjects and a rough map of the region.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to add brackets to the contract so they can cash-out for a partial payment every 25 wands, but that doesn't really help with wrapping up if they don't wish to. I'm thinking maybe having the wizard find them and pay them out anyway as their boss has realised what a terrible idea testing them this way was. But I'm not 100% sold on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also thinking about dialling down the number of missiles the wands make to force them to use more wands. Or at least making it so you can only hit a single target per use. The 3-session game documented above has only used about 75 of the 300 wands in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

For prep I'm going to have a bunch of character sheets partially filled out with the commoner stats ( core rules, page 449 ) so it'll just be naming &amp; quick dice rolling. I'll have some fully made out too in case.

I'm going to have a tonne of stickynotes ready to keep track of all the status effects they're likely to accumulate (with and without realising). And I'm going to have my one-minute egg-timer ready to break out in case metagaming delays the turns. I'll also have the secret copy of the wands effects so far, not just what the players interpret the effects to be.

0,0,7,13,"I'm running a game and my players have ran into some devils disguised as hags who're dealing in soul contracts. A soul contract in this case being that the hags grant some special request to the player who's doing the bargain, and he signs his soul as surety to perform a certain unnamed task for the hags. For cinematic effect I even had the initial signing player's soul broadcast a powerful light emanating out of his chest, forcing all onlookers to shield their eyes, and it traveled down the course of the players arm and into the open wound on his thumb where he blood-inked the soul contract, then binding the soul into the scroll. (However, the player is still allowed to run around the world to perform the task, sort of like a lich with his phylactery - if the PC reneges on the deal or cannot complete the task to the hags' satisfaction, then his soul is forfeit).

   But here's the problem:

   After the game, I went to look up what spells I could have used to justify in how to bind a soul to a contract and I'm not finding anything that's very suitable. Geas is too limited. I would have to use a variant of Binding, Trap the Soul, or (and there's one more which name I have forgotten). But none are exactly as how I've envisioned.

   The simple solution would be just to make my own rules up - however, I like to be one of those meticulous DMs where I actually have a set of written rules to refer to just in case any players comes up with a clever idea of how they might wiggle out of the contract.

   (Q1.) What spells from D&amp;D 3.5 or Pathfinder 1st Ed. could I use to create my soul contract process?

   (Q2.) Has any D&amp;D or PF book ever gone into greater detail in how to use a soul as currency?

####Appearance  

This lanky dragon’s dappled grayish scales and sprawling wings shift and fade in color, blending in with the mist.

####CR   5
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Fogburst (Su) As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 × 5 feet from the center of the fogburst’s area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as obscuring mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Fogvision (Ex) A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation.

Misty Camouflage (Ex) A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed.

Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim’s allies can regroup and come to its rescue.

Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years.

A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

I am currently a level 5 almost level 6 human unchained zen archer in a rise of the runelords campaign. Everymans unchained zen archer seems to round off at level 13 with ki focus bow, giving me at least 7 levels to play with. I am interested in a possible dip into the arcane archer prestige class.

Which level would be the most appropriate time to start the arcane archer multiclassing and what order should it be done in or would it be better to just stay full zen archer? 

For Ki powers, my DM is not allowing me to take the Qinggong power (so no barkskin), so what would be the best ki powers to invests in?

· Point blank master at level 4; replaces still mind

· Ki arrows at level 5: spend 1 ki point to get unarmed damage to arrows for 1 round; replaces still mind

o At level 9 and every 4 levels after, learn another maneuver shot. At level 15 can designate 2 attacks in a flurry of blows as maneuver shots. 

o Maneuvers that can be learned: bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, reposition, sunder, trip

· Reflexive shot at level 9: make AoO with bow; replaces improved evasion

· Trick shot at level 12: spend 1 ki point to ignore concealment, spend 2 to ignore total concealment or cover, spend 3 to ignore total cover even firing arrows around corners; replaces 12th level ki power

0,0,16,3,"So one of my players threw a fit last session, told me he wants his character to do something right for a change, and that he was ""distinctly unsatisfied with the quality"" of the last several sessions.

Two problems, inter-related, one of which is my fault:

I'm a new GM and this is my first campaign, and I have a problem with pacing and with social rolls. There were a couple of incidents where my players rolled high for something but didn't make an argument the NPC would find convincing, so I didn't let the argument succeed, which I probably should have done anyway. My player got mad about this after I did it twice, once to him and once to another character, since I wasn't rewarding high rolls. (I talked it out with my players and we decided that I should set the DCs according to the quality of their arguments. I did warn that I would set crappy arguments very high, though, since this is a talky game and they're putting all their points in Diplomacy now. I'm thinking of putting a cap on how many points you can have in it just so it's not roll-to-win for them.) This player was just trying to brute force his way through every social interaction by banging his staff on the ground and yelling what he wanted loudly, and then rolling Intimidate, which he put a ton of ranks in. When he did that again I wanted to make it more difficult/fun for him. He tried it and rolled really well. I don't think I handled it very well, but I said the DC was very high because the player didn't understand the NPC's native language and looked poorly on outsiders. He got upset, told me he was uncomfortable with me not rewarding a high roll, and had his character quit the main quest, go to the local university, and refuse to get back to the rest of the party until his character had learned the language.

(Later he said that he thinks playing a mentally unstable character was messing him up and causing him to act out like this, so we came up with a cool way to retire the character.)

In the last session, he rolled to understand some papers a scholar NPC wrote, and I told him they make no sense at all, which is useful information and not a reflection on his character's ability to understand something, which seemed to be understood. Unfortunately, I didn't really let him react to it or try to stop the scholar's mad plans before moving on with the scene, since again I'm a new GM and I sort of have pacing problems. We're running over Discord (text-based) and I try to avoid having two minutes of everyone sitting there in silence while my players decide whether or not they want to type something. It's a delicate balance. So understand that I did make a mistake and he was already upset that session, and that I've made some bad calls on how to reward high rolls before.

But later in the session, during the final scene: he and his character expressed a repeated desire to help an NPC who was Balefully Polymorphed. The session before last I gave him a cursebreaker. The NPC insisted several times that he didn't want to be helped and to only reverse the curse if there's an emergency. I put the NPC in the game so that my players had a nuke they could set off if it looks like they were heading towards a TPK or other disaster, and the players know that. The NPC didn't want them to know that if they reversed the curse he'd likely die in a few minutes, just long enough to help them, because he thought they'd never use the cursebreaker if he did. (Probably true, he's a well-loved NPC.) Despite having a lot of warning both IC and OOC that using the cursebreaker would have unknown consequences, and that the NPC was terrified of its use, and that the party debated IC that he shouldn't do it, my player set the cursebreaker off at the end of the session anyway. (By the way, there were some hints in the game as to what would happen to the NPC if they referred back to certain events, but those happened so long ago I don't really count them.)

So after the session was over my player got angry and told me that he's not satisfied with the quality of the game the past few sessions, he wants his character to accomplish something right, and he's uncomfortable. (He did say he doesn't understand why he's uncomfortable, so he's as confused as I am right now.) 

I can see his point of view, and I should have given him an opportunity to stop the scholar, but I feel like what he did to the NPC merits the consequences. I'm not sure if he feels like I was setting him up to fail because I gave him a cursebreaker after him telling me he wanted to break the curse, and also didn't tell him what would happen if he used it, or if he should just accept the consequences of his actions since he was given ample warning both IC and OOC that the NPC would suffer if he did it.

Some more history: 

- the last character he played got tons of attention. He got to romance an NPC, solve the quest of the last arc (and arguably the arc before that too), and the death of that character after he wanted to retire him was designed to be very cool and introduce the campaign's villain. He gets more attention than any other PC and is usually the one suggesting a course of action. So it's not for a lack of participating in the plot, and he's had several incredible victories. Sometimes I sort of have to arrange things so that other characters get the spotlight, for instance, a character he says his PC has a crush on is interested in a different PC, so he won't be having a romance this arc. I don't know if his problem with the game comes from not getting to be the hero all the time.

- he does have a habit of getting uncomfortable and leaving the table, as I illustrated in the language example. A few sessions ago the group did a pretty standard ""somebody at the ball is an assassin, covertly find out who it is and stop them"" and he tried to solve it by shouting that a murder was about to take place, and an NPC quietly told him that he could ruin the target's reputation if he did that. (I was willing to let it play out his way so I wasn't railroading him, but I did want it known that this was a factor in why they asked the party to do it discreetly and there would have been consequences for the NPC.) But then he said he was uncomfortable playing out something so confrontational (he really likes using the word uncomfortable) and left the table again, I just had the guards take his character off for questioning and proceeded as usual.

All of my other players are comfortable and fine with everything I've done, and we've had open and fruitful negotiations about how to handle stuff like PvP when it comes up, or my issue with social rolls. None of them have exhibited anything close to this player's behavior, so I can't figure out where it's coming from or how to fix it. Aside from rewarding good rolls (and there've been dozens of them I've successfully rewarded and only these two or three I've really fucked up on) which we agree I need to work on.

Aside from all this I can't think of anything I've done wrong. Sorry if the post is long, I wanted to be exhaustive about it. 

Mostly, I'm concerned about the next session. The NPC is going to seriously suffer next session and possibly die. They'll have a good chance to save him and his life might otherwise be spared, but it's probably going to be legitimately uncomfortable knowing that your PC did that to a character you loved when you didn't mean to do it. I want to know what to do to keep him calm and prevent him from leaving the table in the middle of the session, especially if he rolls badly and something he tries doesn't work.

Does anybody have any idea why this player is getting repeatedly upset, what I'm doing wrong, and how to get him to relax? I can't figure out if I'm being too harsh or if he's just upset that not everything goes well for him. ",Pathfinder_RPG,I keep making one of my players upset and I'm not sure why

0,0,6,2,"NOTE: If any of my own players see this: GET OUT!

&amp;#x200B;

I want some other GM's opinions on what you would do in this scenario.

Overview: I am running my first live campaign (ie not on Roll20) of the Giantslayer AP. Currently in Book 1. My 4 players are all pretty green to tabletop RPG's generally, and is the first campaign ever for 3 of them. I'm still at the stage where my players are still developing agency in looking up rules/always putting me on the spot to know what can be done when they do something unexpected. It's not bad, but I get overwhelmed by stuff like the following:

The party made the very foolish decision of splitting the party during the most significant combat portion of the book. Being the kind of GM that I am, I don't want to pull punches, so 2 members (the ranger and the cleric) of the party get backed into a burning building by 3 orcs, an encounter which they are overmatched (because the book is written that assumes the party won't split in a war zone).

The cleric, feeling she doesn't have alternative, runs out past the lead orc to get out the burning building and corner they have gotten themselves backed into. The lead orc crits on his AoO with his falchion – which mathematically should have killed the cleric (damage in excess of their CON) and, because the players agreed to subscribe to my rather lethal critical hit/fumble charts, removed her shield arm at the wrist.

It was at this point, that our session last week ended, as one player had to go catch a bus.

Now, the cleric will expend Hero Points (following RAW in their use), at the start of next session to not die/keep their hand. At this point, Paizo says it is at my discretion how I enable the cleric to cheat death.

&amp;#x200B;

There some factors that I am having difficulty weighting:

1) The players are new, including the cleric. They are still learning the rules, and have no concept of Pathfinder's metagame (ie splitting the party at such a critical time is always going to be a poor choice).

2) I made the ruling because of the split, that it will take another 2 rounds before the rest of the party catches up (the bard and fighter were dealing with a different conflict, which they actually succeeded brilliantly at).

3) I am concerned that if I let the cleric go unconscious here (with all the party's heals), as suggested by the Hero Points rules, that it will lead to a death spiral, as the players are not great at tactics and managing action economy, and are basically going to end up coming up to the orcs one at a time.

4) At the same time as all this, I want to be fair and honest, and teach them that their decisions have consequences.

5) my inclination immediately following the end of last session was to let the cleric avoid death and dismemberment, but drop them to dangerously low hitpoints, effectively using their Hero Points to make the orc fail to confirm the crit. Then say something at the time, or after the fight, about how the campaign is designed around them staying together to avoid situations like this in the future (they haven't done anything this foolhardy so far), and then be unforgiving about such errors in the future.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Elemental Projectile(Ex)**

As a standard action, a scorching capuchin can instantly ignite a small object in its hands and throw it at a target within 30ft. as a ranged touch attack. Upon impact, it deals 1d6 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has and can ignite flammable objects. This ability can be used once every 1d4 rounds.

**Burning Bond (Ex)**

As a move action, a scorching capuchin can enter the skin of a willing creature that has no resistance or immunity to fire. He then transforms into a burn on the skin of that creature. When doing so, he deals 1d4 fire damage to the host creature upon entering his body. In this form, the scorching capuchin can not be targeted or attacked directly and only takes half damage when the host is damaged by an area of effect spell.  Also, he cannot take any action except to exit the host creature as a move action.

The scorching capuchin can also use this ability offensively. In this case, it takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the scorching capuchin must also succeed at a melee touch attack to enter an unwilling creature with no resistance or immunity to fire. If the scorching capuchin succeeds, he may enter the skin of the creature and deal 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has to the creature. Each round the scorching capuchin stays in the skin of the creature, the creature must make a DC 14 fortitude save. If it succeeds the scorching capuchin is expelled from it’s skin. If it does not succeed, it take 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has. The scorching capuchin may also exit the creature as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Fire-like Fur(Ex)**

The scorching capuchin’s body is covered in a special fur that has many fire-like properties. First, the fur glows as if the scorching capuchin were affected by the light spell. This effect does not work if the scorching capuchin is using his Burning Bond ability. Second, the scorching capuchin can produce heat with its fur. Anyone striking the scorching capuchin with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of fire damage.

In addition, every hour the alchemist takes 1 point of non lethal damage. This does not heal normally, and can only be removed by Cure spells, or transforming in Hyde, which removes all the damage dealt from holding back.

Ezren and Kyra don’t look to have changed all that much in my opinion and Fumbus is completely new since Damiel...is apparently having something canonical occur to him at the end of Tyrant’s Grasp.

####Appearance  

This large, brown, horse-like creature has a hawk’s wings, talons, and hooked beak.

####CR   2
#####Alignment:  N
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  



#####  
*****
####Ecology  

The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.

A hippogriff’s feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff’s torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.

Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.

Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature’s wings—these saddles are always exotic saddles.

Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young—as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff’s egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load.

I’ve recently become interested in playing a dark tapestry mystery oracle and have been having some difficulty choosing the right curse.

Also, I know cats will hit harder, and other AC would be better, but I like the idea of having a wolf as AC.

Full dmg build will be something like:

* Power attack
* Imp. natural attack
* Vital strike

* Toughness maybe
* Fill (??)
* Dirty fighting
* Improved trip
* Greater trip

&amp;#x200B;

So basically the archetype would take away favored enemy and favored terrain in favor of being more focused on fighting styles

&amp;#x200B;

I am making it so that you can only use this archetype with the archery(ARC), two-weapon fighting (TWF), and natural attack (NA) fighting styles, as those feel the most ranger-esque and I don't want this archetype to step on fighter's toes too much.

&amp;#x200B;

The abilities are:

Level one you gain a bonus feat specifically the one that enables your fighting style

&amp;#x200B;

TWF  gains two weapon fighting

ARC gains Precise shot

NA gains Aspect of the Beast

&amp;#x200B;

At level 4 the Ranger gains the benefits of Weapon specialization when using her combat style,, this improves to greater when the Ranger reaches level 12

&amp;#x200B;

The class gains progression as per fighters weapon training  when using her combat style. they qualify for advanced weapon training abilities each time this ability improves by +1

Notes: with this archetype ranger levels count as fighter levels for featsGenerally speaking as long as you are holding the weapon(s) these class features apply you don't have to use a full attack to make the TWF features work for example.

Hey everyone,

For a reasonably high level PFS-campaign, my paladin is closing in on being able to cast level 4 spells. The clear best of these, at least to me, seems to be greater angelic aspect spell which to other classes is a level 8 arcane or divine spell. I cited the more relevant text of the spell below here:

&amp;#x200B;

"" This spell functions like *lesser angelic aspect*, except you gain lowlight vision; darkvision 60 feet; DR 10/evil; immunity to acid, cold, and petrification; resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10; a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison; and protective aura and truespeech as supernatural abilities for the duration of the spell. Also, your wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.

&amp;#x200B;

Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* and a ***lesser globe of invulnerability***\*\*, both with a radius of 20 feet.\*\*""

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: if an enemy tries to cast dispel magic (spell level 3) on this, what happens? Lesser globe of invulenrability reads:

""An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower.

Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a *dispel magic* spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.""

&amp;#x200B;

So... if I understand correctly, a dispelling enemy (who only has access to basic dispel magic, not greater dispel) would have to first specifically target the protective aura surrounding the caster of greater angelic aspect, since if they don't, the dispel magic cannot reach through the aura since it is a level 3 spell (the aura functions as lesser globe of unvulnerability and blocks level 3 and below spells from ffecting those within it). But... is that possible? That would mean partially dispelling a part of the spell, in this case the aura, without affecting anything else the greater angelic aspect does, which i haven't ever seen happen otherwise (in my experience, magic is normally either fully active or fully dispelled). Is this possible or impossible, and why? Would two level 3 dispel magics be able to dispel greater angelic aspect, or do I need only one and would targetting the aura with dispel magic also remove the rest of the shapechange? Or is it outright impossible to dispel no matter how many levele 3 dispel magics are avilable?

0,0,8,2,"I am playing a halfling Bard who started with a pretty edgy backstory but has turned more wholesome due to some tweaking due to some vague language I used to describe her. 
Started with her following Norgerber and was a popular Bard at Taverns but would perform her duties wearing a mask and cape so as no one knew it was her. This was due to she wanted to get revenge on the parents who (she BELIEVED to have) left her, and the slave trader who kidnapped her and threw her in his lineup at the Okeno Flesh Fairs when she was 4.

Then she met her mother, even purchasing her as she was a slave and ripping the contract before her eyes. She learned the truth of what happened (a friend who was going to get her mother and her away from the debt her father acrewed, but sold both of  and betrayed them). She turned to Desna with the help of a Paladin Halfling NPC in our party (as well as Desna granting some pretty interesting dreams to her, stamping her bright blue butterfly everywhere in the dreams so Sistra knew). Still Chaotic, but leaning more to good than neutral (or even Evil if she continued on her path). 

Now, I have fully fleshed out this character. I can tell you she's been to (almost) every city in the Ketapesh region due to her travelling heart. I can tell you about someone she knows in each city. I know a great deal about the region, the laws, and what to expect in each town (My DM loves this due to a lot of it isn't in the manual as it's pretty bare bones, but it helps him flesh out the regions a bit more and give it more life and he doesn't have to study it particularly and things come across more naturally as my Bard spews info about every place she knows in efforts to come off as smart). Needless to say, I studied a lot for this character. 

But there is one thing I didn't study. Halfling culture and lore.

I played it because she got taken away from that at age 4, she wouldn't remember it. She didn't even speak halfling, only common. Due to wanting to keep the character real, I never studied it, instead studying human traits as that is who she was mainly around. But since meeting her mother, I got the green light from the DM that my Bard would learn these things from her mother. 

My question is, I can't find much. And to someone who loves to implement things that are important to her into the game and how I play her, I find this lack luster. I want to know history. I want to know heroes. I really want it all so that I have this knowledge and I can play to it. 

Is there any particular links, or maybe even fun things you have heard of about Halflings that you are willing to share? I really believe she would dive head first into any and all information she could find about halflings as it's something new and about finding who she is at the most basic of roots.

0,0,6,7,"I was browsing various teamwork feats that'd be suitable for Twinned Summoners, and came across Allied Spellcaster. Potentially, this could be a really good feat when paired with Twin Summoner (16th level ability), but there are various wordings of several abilities that make it difficult to know how it'd react all together. 

So let's start with the basics of what we know. 

&gt;Teamwork Feats (Ex)  
&gt;  
&gt;At 4th level and at 12th level, a twinned summoner gains a bonus teamwork feat. He must meet the prerequisites of the selected teamwork feat. **The twinned summoner automatically grants all of his teamwork feats to his eidolon. The eidolon doesn’t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Allied Spellcaster  
&gt;  
&gt;**Prerequisites**: Caster level 1st.  
&gt;  
&gt;(1) Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus on level checks made to overcome spell resistance. 

Alright, so at the very least, both the Summoner and Eidolon can *have* the Allied Spellcaster feat by level 4, pre-reqs be damned, and they can both benefit from the +2 bonus to overcome SR. However, 

&gt;(2) If your ally has the same spell prepared (or known with a slot available if they are spontaneous spellcasters), this bonus increases to +4 and you receive a +1 bonus to the caster level for all level-dependent variables, such as duration, range, and effect. 

the issue starts showing when we look at Twin Summoner, and figuring out if the Summoner or Eidolon can even benefit from the feat's secondary effect. 

&gt;Twin Summoner (Su)  
&gt;  
&gt;At 16th level, a twinned summoner can touch his [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/summoner-unchained/#TOC-Eidolon) as a standard action, enhancing its similarity to the summoner. The [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/summoner-unchained/#TOC-Eidolon) loses any natural weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#TOC-Intelligence-Int-), [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-), and [Charisma ](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. **The** [**eidolon**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/summoner-unchained/#TOC-Eidolon) **can cast any of the summoner’s spells known using the summoner’s caster level and spell slots. It doesn’t gain the benefit of any of the summoner’s items, feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting.** 

So to determine if the Summoner or Eidolon can even use the secondary effect of Allied Spellcaster, we need to know if;

1. Does the Eidolon count as knowing a spell and having a spell slot available (when using Twin Summoner) for the Summoner to be able to benefit from the feat's additional effects?
2. Can the Eidolon benefit from any of the effects of Allied Spellcaster (when using Twin Summoner)?

Having just retaken Fort Ranick from the ogres (without the help of their cleric for the final fight due to him missing the session that week) they bloodied group decided the traitor wasn't so bad an was likely just influenced by magic, wanting to save him. A nap back in Turtleback Ferry felt like a good idea! So they went back, except the Kobold sorcerer who sent his goblin dog steed running off into the forest to avoid capture by the ogres. He stayed back to track down his ride and thus was delayed by about an hour. 

Since the triggering event for the flood occurs when the PC's return... The Kobold was much closer to the dam than the rest of the party, and when the damn broke and the others were busy fighting off a Hydra (an encounter they fled from on the way to Turtleback, replaced the giant snake attacking the school kids because I felt it was more dramatic!) And saving people from the temple to Erastil, the Kobold went to the dam and saw the damage...and the massive black octopus like monster speeding down from it towards the town.

 Thinking quickly, he used his two of his three real spell slots to trigger fireballs at key locations at a choke point further down, trying to make a rockslide. Given all the rain, I decided to create a mudslide instead, enough to stop the flood waters briefly and perhaps halt the monster. Not done yet, his last high level spell was used to cast fire wall, powered by an item he picked up awhile back. A mask of Nethys that can be used to cast extra spells (one lvl 5 spell, 5 lvl 1 spells, or any combination there in) or add 1d6 damage per charge used. Each charge increases chance that something goes horribly wrong (basically wild magic). He rolls to control the wild magic, gets a nat20. I describe as this massive wall, 5 times bigger than he expected bursts into life just in front of his new mud dam. Black Magga is going too fast to avoid it by now and smashes into it, reeling in pain. It only took a moment, but it was enough to make Black Magga turn away and head back...and then the Kobold failed a stealth check by 1 and black Magga sees him with one of her freakish eye tendrils. 

Thinking that this little gnat couldn't hardly be the source of her pain, she makes a single passing strike to the already somewhat injured Kobold. It hits, heavily injuring him but somehow he survived (*cough* freakishly lucky low die rolls on my end but I had terrible dice that night). For SOME REASON! the Kobold decides to follow black Magga more, and she finds him again, hitting him with her breath of madness. He fails his save and is confused for two rounds....and spent both trying to attack the closest target...black Magga.

 Round one, the Kobold closes the distance and Chuck's a dagger at it, barely notices it. Round two, the Kobold casts jump and sticks the landing and starts climbing up black Magga. Round three, black Magga is halfway back up the dam when he comes to his senses and panicked. Does the one thing can can think to do. Puts on the Gorgon mask from the first Lamia, crawls up to Black Magga's eye and tries to petrify her. Of course she made the save and continues her climb. Not before grabbing the Kobold and sending him flying away from her as she has bigger ancient monster things to do.

 I figure, this is it. The Kobold falls to his death. But nope,  manages to get off a feather fall before he hits the ground...the Kobold survives. And the best part, no one in the party is going to believe him when he gets back to tell them of his heroism.

0,0,14,24,"So to give context this group is what got me into table top RPGs and I can never thank them enough for that. The first 8 characters with this group were great. Sure they would argue from time to time and one player would always complain about his Druid not being a damage dealer like he wanted. Which we all told him Druids aren’t the high damage decent health role he was trying to use it for. He’d run into fights and try to frontline and just get destroyed by the enemy. So after talking to the gm about multi classing about this Druid monk thing he found online I thought the problem would be solved. Technically speaking it was solved, he now has Ki points like a monk giving him flurry of blows and all that along with all his Druid spells and can now transform into like a weretiger? He explained it as his arms changed into that of a tiger and so did his head. According to him this gave him 1 bite attack and 2 claw attacks on top of his normal attacks with flurry of blows. This was a total of 5 attacks in his one turn. That right there was a red flag for me, but the gm didn’t argue because we were in the middle of a massive boss fight and this player always argues until he wins. So 5 attacks on his turn with whatever a monks unarmed strike is I didn’t know what that was so I figured “it can’t be too much.” Well it turns out he also got the gm to modify the spell Flaming Strike for him, which as I understand is a pick a 10 foot area to make a flaming cylinder shoot up from the ground 1d6 per caster level to everything in the area. The version he had allowed him to cast it on his fists giving him 1d6 per caster level on his unarmed strikes. So at level 9 that’s 9d6 for all 5 of his attacks per turn. On average assuming I’m good at math and not including a varying AC that’s around 135 damage a turn. That’s double my health as well as the health of everyone but one character in our party which is our Paladin. She’s the only one who stands a chance of surviving his onslaught. So he does insane damage has the second most health and AC in the group and has some nice healing/buffing spells because he’s a druid and we’re only level 9. It just seems crazy to me that he’s able to dish all of that out and still be able to self sustain himself. 

It feels like he’s got all the stats of both a level 9 monk and a level 9 Druid.

The next thing I learned that worried me was our bard wants to have a massive AOE charm that works on anyone in the radius. The GM did say at level 10 we could get one ability that bends the rules so I choose being able to make potions of spells past level 3. Our bard wants an infinite AOE charm with either a really high DC, past 25, or will save involved. It just seems like the game is spiraling into a chaos of broken nonsense. I’m so close to just roleplaying myself out because I have never enjoyed games where you walk over everything like it’s nothing. I have been known to overthink things though so what are your guys thoughts on all of this?

Edit: I would say the thing that bothers me most is that boss we were fighting used on ability that knocked out everyone but this Druid monk. As the group currently stands the enemies are being made to fight him and that ends up with them mopping the floor with the rest. 

I guess it also bothers me that he went and complained long enough for it to get fixed for him. He didn’t just gain one level in this Nature’s avatar class he got all of his levels moved over into this class. Which that I admit is just petty because no one enjoys playing a character they don’t like.  To give a bit more of a preface of this player he also gets spells like stone shape formed into a combat spell. He asked to use it to form a dome over an enemy trapping them, that’s logical, but then he said I want the dome to immediately shrink and crush him to death. The gm rolled a strength check the enemy succeeded and wasn’t crushed. The player then argued that there’s no way he can resist pounds of stone crushing him to death he shouldn’t even get a save it should just be immediate death.

So, as per the help and advice I received in [this post](https://redd.it/b3a7zh), I felt myself decently prepared for this very first session in my new campaign, in spite of a smaller-than-expected party. 

Unfortunately for me, the wizard had also backed out a day or two prior to the session, leaving me with just a warpriest and a sorcerer to play the Pathfinder Beginner Box Adventure. Both were still happy to play and so I decided to have them start at level 2. 

The session lasted for 3 hours. We had the usual session zero talk, like how we're going to play, what people are expecting and hoping to get out of it, what rules to follow, etc.

Then we played the entirety of the Adventure, with the party even shaving off over half of Black Fang's HP in the final encounter. As per the book, Black Fang flees after unleashing his breath weapon, leaving a stressed out Warpriest and an unconscious Sorcerer with the spoils of his hoard and a well-earned level up.

In spite of the drawbacks brought about by the party size, we had some good laughs, fun times, and some lucky rolls. Both guys have agreed to continue this as a bi-weekly campaign into Rise of The Rune Lords, with our first session starting a month from now.

####Appearance  

This squat, clawed humanoid is hunched and pink-skinned, with an oversized head. Its face is that of a fanged and insane human baby, and its mouth opens far wider than it should.

####CR   3
#####Alignment:  N
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing lava child can pass through stone, dirt, metal, lava, or almost any other sort of earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lava child flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) A lava child is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and has the earth descriptor.

Magma Throwing (Su) A lava child can cough up a ball of magma into its hand as a move action. It remains hot as long as the lava child holds it, but cools to the ambient temperature 1 round after it is released. A lava child can throw a magma ball as if it were a flask of alchemist’s fire, or add its damage to one successful claw attack. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice. On any round in which the lava child remains partially immersed in molten stone and does not leave it, it may scoop up a handful as a move action and then throw it as if using this ability, but that action does not count toward its daily limit.

Metal Immunity (Su) Lava children ignore the presence of metal and are able to pass through it as easily as air. They are immune to metal weapons, and their attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal armor and shields.

Vulnerability to Cold and Water (Ex) Spells and effects with the water or cold subtype inflict +50% damage against lava children (though these vulnerabilities do not stack—effects that are both cold and water still deal only an additional +50% damage). Splashing a lava child with at least 1 gallon of water inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Immersion in water causes lava children to take 2d6 points of damage per round and affects them as a slow spell while they remain submerged.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Lava children are ill-tempered creatures created by shaitan genies. Shaped like stunted humanoids with the hideous heads of fanged infants, they prefer to reside in volcanoes. Typical lava children are 5 feet tall and 450 pounds.
Variants
Because of their strange means of reproduction, lava children have branched out over the generations into a number of distinct variations. Below are some of the most common.

Chieftains (+1 CR): The most important of all lava children variants are the chieftains, those exceptional lava children who employ magic and rhetoric to inspire or browbeat their cystmates into obedience. Lava children chieftains are visually indistinguishable from ordinary lava children, but often bear several innate magical abilities passed down from parent to offspring in what the chieftains (sometimes referred to as priests, though not necessarily affiliated with a deity) claim are a physical manifestation of their right to lead. Divine right or otherwise, lava children chieftains are most likely to lead from the rear, using their lava channel ability to heal lava children and other elemental creatures commanded into their service, while simultaneously unleashing their spell-like abilities to defend their cysts or make war upon those who fail to show proper deference. For reasons not entirely understood, lava children chieftains are much longer-lived than ordinary lava children, with a lifespan similar to that of dwarves. Lava children chieftains have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294) and the following abilities:

Spell-Like Abilities (CL 5th; concentration +7):
At will—faerie fire
3/day—pyrotechnics (DC 15), stone shape
1/day—contact other plane (earth or fire elemental plane only), summon nature's ally III (creatures with earth or fire subtype only)

Lava Channel (Su): Three times per day, a lava child chieftain can channel volcanic energy to produce an explosion of molten rock, which functions like the channel positive energy ability of a cleric, except that it heals 3d6 points of damage for creatures with the earth or fire subtypes and does 3d6 points of fire damage to all others.

Lava Form (Su): A lava child chieftain can shift between its solid body and one made of molten rock as a standard action. In lava form, the chieftain gains the elemental subtype, and its claw attacks add +1d6 fire damage. Any creature grappling or striking the lava form with natural weapons or natural attacks takes 1d6 points of fire damage. It can remain in this form for up to 5 minutes per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

Behemoth (+1 CR): This rare caste of warrior lava children was designed by its creators for espionage missions into especially dangerous regions. Though most behemoths succumbed to the high mortality rate that came with following their creators’ orders, a few managed to survive and breed. Lava children behemoths have the giant creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295) and Improved Bull Rush as a bonus feat. They gain the following special attack.

Tremor (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a lava child behemoth can slam its fists to the ground to create an earth tremor. The behemoth makes a trip attempt against all adjacent creatures. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity and the behemoth is not at risk of being knocked prone. Multiple behemoths can cooperate to affect a larger area; as long as each behemoth uses this ability at the same time and is adjacent to at least one other behemoth using this ability, the affected area increases by 5 feet in all directions.

Youths and Ancients (–1 CR): While mature lava children are Medium-sized, they are smaller at both the beginning and the end oflife. Newborn lava children are already the size of halflings, and grow quickly to full size within 6 years. At the opposite end oflife, the venerable lava children past 70 years of age lose their strength and mass as their bodies slowly wither. Both youths and ancients use the young creature simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295); the latter also apply venerable age modifiers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169).

0,0,30,6,"Hello!

The campaign I'll be starting soon will be a little bit particular, so before answering read on the special rules we have.

The GM is trying a concept for a custom campaign based on MMOs. We're 6 players, and a GM. We can have several characters and they all start at lvl 1 with 20 BP, always. We can switch characters, and they're basically all ""us"", so offer very little roleplay value. This means... the world will be ruthless. The main point probably is that the GM won't have to hold back on his builds, making his characters weaker and whatnot, and won't have to feel bad when he (accidentally or not) kills our character.

Abuses like logging on to a character with buffs, using Mage Armor on everyone, then logging on to the other character are forbidden, obviously lol. Crafting is also highly nerfed (so a lvl 3 crafter can't just do everything). We need to have the item's CL to be able to craft it (this means that we need to be Caster Level 8 for any sort of Headband, for example). If I want a crafter, I need it to be able to get to high level. This is so most of our interesting items come from monster loot, which the GM plans to make pretty good. (A lot of other rules are also in place, mostly just banning the most broken things in Pathfinder like races that are too powerful, Leadership feats and whatnot)

If a character dies... he's dead (that's the choice we made as players, we were offered the choice to be able to ressurect them but we refused, for challenge). This means we start over with another character at lvl 1 (or switch to another character we previously trained, we can log on any one at any time so we can level up several ones). But we can get powerleveled by higher-level characters. Experience is flat, and I think we get bonus xp if we're with a higher-level party or something (to be able to get back on track quicker), although we will have level disparities. Items can be transfered from one character to the other btw, and it automatically happens if we die.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 2 concepts for characters : my main one would be a Scythe-wielding Warpriest. Unfortunately, Leadership feats and most broken things are forbidden, so I can't just give crits to myself with a Dual-Kukri Squire with Butterfly Sting or whatever. But I still want the flavor of a Scythe badass of Urgathoa as a 'main' character, eventually getting a Void Scythe (crafted at lvl 13 ;-;). But before making that, I might want to create a Craftsman.

I have looked around on the Internet (Forgemaster Dwarf, craft Wizard, craft Alchemist, etc.) but can't seem to decide. I have never played a Wizard, but most people seem to say that Wizard is the best at crafting. Thing is, that 1d6 per hit dice is scary, and by experience, I know that every intelligent creature goes for the Wizard or caster first. I mean, don't we all? They're the squishiest and most dangerous, most of the time. Since the world is going to be pretty dangerous, I feel like I would die before I even get Craft Wondrous Items or anything lol Also I have 0 experience as a Mage and have no idea what direction to take. My brain is already overheating by all the information I looked around for my Warpriest. My first concept was to make the Warpriest the crafter anyway, but that would require me to be Human instead of an Oni-Spawn Tiefling, lose stats, etc. And since we can have several characters, that might not be the most interesting thing to do.

Anyway, what's your opinion on this? Do you guys have any good character concepts? Also if you have anything else than a craftsman to propose, I'm open for it too. Some way to take advantage of this multi-character thing. The only thing to remember is that I can expect the GM to kill any of us at any time lol (not with bullshit, just with well-built enemies).

I thus inquire your help!

The idea being that when the music box is open and playing, a bard wouldn’t have to spend rounds of performance to maintain effects, but also not eat up any actions on the Bards part beyond the initial activation.

Right!

The sources I've found that mention the reasoning behind switching CMW out for Stabilize say something to the effect that unlimited healing is OP. From where I'm sitting, I can't for the life of me see why.

I'm assuming combat healing is probably not the problem, since one HP for a standard action at touch range is miniscule.

So, why, exactly, is out-of-combat healing at a rate of 100 HP per ten minutes spent bustling around praying over the wounded actually a problem for the game?

Edit: the answer is that it would turn Golarion into a superhero setting. Thanks to /u/energyscholar for pointing that out.

For anyone unfamiliar with the character, when she is in a stressful situation or when she is embarrassed or afraid, she becomes heated and can actually make things catch fire with a touch or in a couple situations, she’s vomited lava. 

Note: This is not meant to copy the character’s ability but is only inspired by them. 

The curse

Super Heated

In times of great stress, your body heats to the point of burning all that you touch. 

Whenever you are the subject of an attack, wether or not it hits, you gain the shaken condition for one round. So long as you are shaken, you may make a touch attack that deals 1d4+cha fire damage. (Consecutive hits don’t worsen it but other fear effects can)

Level 5: treat fear effects as one step less severe (to a minimum of shaken)

Level 10: resistance 10 fire 

Level 15: immune to frightened condition and resist 20 fire

&gt;Calistria the goddess of many faces and guises, including lust. Reading the ancient tomes and scrolls about her, you will find numerous stories of her trysts; for she is seen as a desirable partner by both divine beings and mortals alike. Her trysts are well documented and often near legendary, though conflicting sources result in difficulty should one attempt to discern those tales based in truth from those that are nothing more than fantasy. Many mortals have attempted and failed to woo the Savored Sting, the tale of Cayden Cailean's claims that his rise to divinity was the result of a failed attempt to win the attention of the Unquenchable Fire. One other tale tells of the one who wooed her, the Mountain Chieftain Urtar Argus. Their brief union resulted in an offspring that would drive them apart.    
&gt;  
&gt;Calistria hid her child away, hoping he would never find him, and for that Darvan Seckor was left to fend for himself in the slums of Riddleport from such a tender age. It wasn't long before he found sanctuary and a family with the criminal enterprises that plied their trade there.    
&gt;  
&gt;Even with his young age he had a natural talent, one that the local thieves guild exploited. A man by the name of Vachedi Kjell took him under his wing, taught him everything he knew, and introduced him to his deity; Calistria.    
&gt;  
&gt;The unscrupulous lot that surrounded him, almost respected him but, certainly admired him for his gusto in a bar fight. Despite the company he kept he never lost the goodness inside him but, being forced to break his moral code just to survive, tore him up.    
&gt;  
&gt;He strived to find away out, a way to escape this life that would certainly kill him, if not, damn him for eternity.    
&gt;  
&gt;It wasn’t long though before his actions caught his mothers attention. She appeared to him as a hallucinogenic vision caused from a wasp sting to the back of the neck, and in this vision she promised him what he desired, that she could be the family he never truly had.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the offer, the only thing he had to do was one last terrible act, and he would be free. To betray his family in hope for a better one. When the time came, Calistria awoke that ancient primal energy, releasing untold power into his veins, his eyes bursting into green flame, and runes circle forming around his wrists and upper forearm, the product of centuries weaved together; the manifestation of destiny had begun.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it was all said and done, the guilds headquarters was on fire, and Darvan slipped into the night grasping Vachedi Kjell’s lucky signet ring in his hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;After many years, and a lot of miles travelled he now stands just under 6' tall and 180lbs or so, dressed in grey and black robes, and with a grey headscarf wrapped around his head, and covering his face. Pulling the scarf down past the mouth reveals well kept brown facial hair, and emerald green eyes. To accessorise his modest dress he wears a pendant dedicated to Calistria around his neck, and has festooned his birthmark riddled hands with silver signet rings. The birthmarks closely make out the symbol to the evocation school of magic, and seem to almost emanate an energy of their own. Slung over his shoulders is an old battered scroll holder, and by standing in close proximity you catch a whiff of almond coming off of him, almost as something has turned acidic.   
   
&gt;  
&gt;And so his story arrives at Sandpoint, and who knows what future that has in store for him

I want the wizard in the group to feel useful, but that is impossible if he simply prepared the wrong spells that day. I could give extremely obvious hints about what's coming, but that kind of ruins the fun of an unexpected encounter or event.

One alternative I have heard of and played around with in the past is the Mana or Magic Points system, where each spell slot is converted to a number of points equal to it's level, and all caster classes simply spend those points to cast whatever spell they know (With each spell costing a number of points equal to its level). It's a lot truer to the video game RPG style than the D&amp;D style, but it makes classes like Sorcerer, Bard, and Oracle lose one of their main features by making all casting classes essentially the same. It also doesn't quite mesh with bonus spells from outside sources like Witch Patrons or Cleric Domains.

How can i make this work best with the introduction of 2e mechanics? If i cant, whats a good debuffiner alternate within the 2e universe?

Edit: 

*Enforcer:*

Benefit: Whenever you deal nonlethal damage with a melee weapon, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize your target as a free action. If you are successful, the target is shaken for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt. If your attack was a critical hit, your target is frightened for 1 round with a successful Intimidate check, as well as being shaken for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt.

*rime spell:*

Benefit: The frost of your cold spell clings to the target, impeding it for a short time. A rime spell causes creatures that takes cold damage from the spell to become entangled for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell.

This feat only affects spells with the cold descriptor.

Level Increase: +1 (a rime spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.)

*frostbite:*

School transmutation [cold]; Level bloodrager 1, druid 1, magus 1, shaman 1, witch 1

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

EFFECT

Range touch
Targets creature touched
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes

DESCRIPTION

Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1 point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target recovers from the nonlethal damage. This spell cannot make a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

*whip:*

Cost 1 gp Weight 2 lbs.
Damage 1d2 (small), 1d3 (medium) Critical x2 Type slashing
Category one-handed Proficiency exotic
Weapon Group flails
Special disarm, nonlethal, reach, trip

A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon. Wielding a whip in two hands does not add 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage rolls as with other weapons (UE update).",Pathfinder_RPG,"We're thinking about switching to 2e, but my build gets nerfed HARD. how would you guys balance this?"

There's three players in the game, a CG Chelish Gunslinger, a CE Tiefling Witch, and a CN Kellid Barbarian. The first two are fugitives from the Cheliax (but for very different reasons), the other is from a slaughtered village near the Worldwound and is looking for his brother who survived. We were set to start the game in Varisia, when I realised this region really lends itself as a sort of Wild West analogue - considering we had a gunslinger in the party, I decided to lean into that and sort of reskin the region to match:

1. The Cheliax is sort of like Britain and East coast USA, keen on absorbing Varisia.
2. Veldraine is already basically a Chelish colony. Curse of the Crimson Throne will involve a Chelish plot to annex Korvosa centrally.
3. Instead of Hellknights, we've got Hellmarshalls - the long arm of the law, these duster-clad crusaders roam Varisia hunting outlaws and dispensing frontier justice. 
4. Instead of the Sable Company, we've got the Sable Cavalry: eloquent, prestigious, and aloof, these mounted aristocrats serve the Queen of Korvosa directly.
5. Each town has a sheriff and a deputy instead of a town guard. If need be, the sheriff will deputise townsfolk. Bigger towns have a militia.
6. The Shoanti can basically just be themselves. Varisians are more Mexican.
7. Kaer Maga is a bit like a lawless Mexican frontier town, well beyond the reach of the Hellmarshalls and the Sable Cavalry.

So I'm considering making a Progenitor Druid because I like the Fey-focused flavor and the wild magic chance feature (""A progenitor who chooses magic as her primal bond can draw upon wild magic as a swift action to attempt to cast a prepared spell without losing that spell from its spell slot.

To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell’s effects take place, she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell’s level). If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its effects are replaced by a wild magic effect with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered until the end of her next turn. If she succeeds, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later point. A progenitor can use wild magic in this manner once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter."")

Completely sand-boxed meaning the DM drops you into a world they have created, and you just do things/get into trouble/piss monsters off/hunt treasure/, ect.

On the other hand, the slightly railroaded option would look a little something like this: DM has created a homebrew world and dropped your party into it, but there is an over-arcing story-line to go along with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been a member of this sub for a long time now (about 3 years) and everyone here has helped me out so much, I feel completely in debt. So, not long ago I finished a code I had been working on for a while now, it is based on the  diagrammatic cipher but, since I am a crazy gm, I had gone over the top to complicate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the link to the google drive where you can find every letter, together with the image to decipher it. Let me know what you think, I hope at least someone has a use for this XD.

PS: if you do not understand it, just think about it only looking at the color of the dot, ie black dot represents the right side and white dot represents the left side.

PSSS: I didnt know what to flair this so.... I guess game craft will do XD

I’m debating 16 in INT or a 16 in DEX. The other would get a 14.

I generally like to role play smarter PC’s but I don’t think the point difference will make a difference for roleplay. This makes it mostly mechanical.

16 dex will get me 1 AC, 1 Reflex, +1 to hit with ranged touch attacks.

Int will really just net me a bonus skill point a level.

I like skills but mechanically the dex seems better. I’m leaning towards INT. 

My character is a Sylvan Sorcerer with a bunch of Buff spells to make the companion better with only a bare minimum of blasts for use when blasting just makes more sense than buffing. I’ll pick more save/suck spells if we get to 4th and 5th Level spells.

&amp;#x200B;

His party are all followers of Iomedae and more specifically are a part of a cult that honors the Hand of the Inheritor in their crusade to promote just rulers and remove the land of evil influences.  The party has a pair of paladins within it, who are identical twins and by identical, I mean identical.  I got to look at their stat sheets and with the exception of one taking toughness so that his HP-pool could match his brother's they are stat for stat, the same.  (Teamwork feats by the way.)

&amp;#x200B;

Both paladins were raised in the cult with the party born only three minutes apart from each other and have never left each others sides for longer than a week or two at a time.  They've just turned twenty-seven and have been on several successful adventures leading the cult to recognize their talents. A higher position within the cult opened and both paladins were nominated to it. Since they were identical, the cult asked if they would prefer to stand at a trial to prove who was more worthy and the paladins agreed.  They were given the option of debate or an honorable duel.  The players choose the duel.  


Here is the sticking part, both players retired the evening before and prayed to Iomedae for guidance and blessing in the following conflict so that neither would be harmed but that they'd best serve their god.  Both proceeded to roll natural 20s on their supplication.  The DM has said unless a better idea comes up, he's just going to say their prayers cancelled each other out and they are both suited for the position so whoever wins, wins.

0,0,7,2,"I want to make an item that can resurrect people, but I don't know how to balance it properly. My party is level 3 right now and they will get a chance to get this item around level 7 (depending on which milestones they get). The party does not have a caster that can resurrect, but I would like to give them the opportunity to save their characters from death.

The item is a +2 Dagger that absorbs the life force of creatures that it slays and can resurrect people with that life force. The players won't know how the item works exactly until they do extensive research into it or find someone who does know the item. The only thing they would know is that it can resurrect people by plunging the knife into the heart of a dead person and that it uses the life force of slain enemies to do so.

**Absorbing Knife** (actual name will be different, but I don't want my players to find it)

This +2 Ademantine dagger absorbs the life force of creatures it slays. It gets one stack for every HD off a creature it deals the killing blow to. Using this knife to kill innocent creatures will result in an alignment shift towards evil, subject to the DM.

The life force stored in the knife can be used to resurrect people and creatures as follows:
The creature to be resurrected has to be stabbed in the heart while the knife holds enough stacks, within one day of its death. This has the following effects:

- The creature is marked by the (homebrewed) God of Death: A black mark forms around the heart. If a creature is resurrected multiple times, this mark grows larger.
- The creature is resurrected as per the following spell, according to the amount of stacks in the knife and its level or HD:

Reincarnate: 1x stacks per level/HD

Reincarnate (only one negative level): 2x stacks per level/HD

Raise Dead: 3x stacks per level/HD

Raise Dead (only one negative level): 4x stacks per level/HD

Resurrection: 5x stacks per level/HD

- The knife loses all its leftover stacks.

I would like some help with the amount of stacks needed to resurrect someone. If I would choose it myself I think I would use 5 for x for the stacks needed (eg: to Reincarnate a level 8 character the knife would have to hold 1\*5\*8 = 40 stacks, to Resurrect the same character, the knife would have to hold 5\*5\*8 = 200 stacks). However, I have no idea if that is too hard or too easy. To me the Reincarnate would be fine with that option, but Resurrect might be too hard to reach (although that might not matter).

Keep in mind that the players have to take risks (use a dagger to deal the finishing blow instead of a better weapon or keeping an enemy alive for a little longer to finish him off with the dagger) to get stacks. They would also have no exact idea how much stacks the knife holds, unless they roll a high enough knowledge check for the creature they killed with the knife, although I would give them a range the HD falls in if their knowledge isn't high enough.


Obviously, the loss of the material components of the spells makes it pretty powerful as well, so I want to make it hard to reach the needed amount of stacks, but it still has to be attainable. Another way to fix this would be to require a ritual that consumes a certain amount of material components, just like the spells, but I am still on the fence about what to do.

0,0,2,12,"Just to give some context, I'm current playing the Strange Aeons AP (on the second half of the second book or somewhere along these lines) and, after spending quite a few levels with only the items we could find out there (and a player deciding he wants to fully switch his character), our GM allowed us to swap all our loot for new items. Since our party has only 3 members, we have more gold than expected, so I  want to either chose some nice magic items or save money for them.

I'm playing a Summoner (Morphic Savant/Godcaller) that is a fervorous follower of Desna, calling critters ""from the dreamlands"" (aka summoned monsters with tons of evolutions and templates) to help and support my party. Summoner-specific items are rare and rod of giant summoning is (rightfully) banned, but my GM agreed to give me custom items if they fit the theme.

Based on that, I've come up with a few suggestions - some that I could acquire right now, others that could be on my 'roadmap' - and I'd love to know how balanced/well priced they seem.

* **Rod of Starsung Summons (Lesser)**

  * Price: 3000~4000 GP (based on other Lesser rods)

  * Description: This delicate iron rod has an intricate pattern of constellations all over its surface and a moth-shaped handle in the middle. One end is marked by an eight-pointed star, while the other one displays a waning moon

  * Effect: The wielder can use the rod up to **three times per day** to augment her casting of a conjuration(summoning) spell or spell-like ability. Doing so grants her summons the same effects of having either **[Moonlight Summons](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Moonlight%20Summons) or [Starlight Summons](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Starlight%20Summons)** (chosen when the spell is cast). The same effect applies to all summoned creatures. Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower.

  * Comments: a thematic item that fits VERY well with my character, enhancing summons with Desna's characteristics - the enhancements are situational at best, though, so it's more of an utility/style item that will only be useful on a few (key) encounters, I believe.

* **Scepter of the Dreamcaller** (version 1)

  * Price: 15k~20k

  * Description: the same as a [**Suzerain Scepter**](https://aonprd.com/MagicRodsDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Suzerain%20Scepter), swapping Knowledge(nobility) for Knowledge(planes), removing the Leadership bonus and limiting the morale bonus to summoned creatures.

  * Comments: a little bit too expensive for now, and paying 5k for two +5s feels suboptimal when 20k is already over my total budget. The concept of buffing minions is very cool and it could combo well with the correct buil though. Finally, my summons are already VERY effective on attacking, so I'm not sure whether this bonus will be useful nor healthy for the campaign.

* **Scepter of the Dreamcaller** (version 2)

  * Price: 7k~9k GP

  * Description: this pearlescent marble scepter is topped by a blue gemstone cut as an eight-pointed star.

  * Effect: A Scepter of the Dreamcaller radiates a continuous [Bless](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bless) effect that affects any creature summoned or called by the wielder. Further more, it can be used once per day to cast [Beacon of Luck](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Beacon%20of%20Luck) for up to 5 minutes.

  * Comments: now that's more like it! A small but nice buff to summoned creatures and a defensive/supportive effect for emergencies - using a Desnan spell no less. Perhaps the effect Beacon of Luck could automatically affect the summons, but not the caster nor its allies (would this be stronger or weaker?).

* **Dreamcatcher of unsung fates**

  * Price: 5400 GP

  * Description: this dreamcatcher, made from elk antlers and a silvery thread, is adorned with an arrangement of dark and brightly colored feathers. The shape defined by its threads seem to change from time to time, but the resulting patterns are hardly discernible.

  * Effect: **By sleeping under a Dreamcatcher** of Unsung Fates for 8h without interruptions, one can tap into the Dreamlands and glimpse alternate versions on herself. When the sleeper wakes up she can **choose any one feat for which she meets the prerequisites**. Then, during the next 24 hours (or before the next time she sleeps, whichever happens before) she can, as a standard action, **be treated as if she possessed the chosen feat for up to five minutes** as long as she wears the dreamcatcher. If the chosen feat allows especific choices (such as a spell learned from Expanded Arcana), the Dreamcatcher will always grant the same choice unless the user refrains from sleeping under it for 48h.

  * Comments: ok, I know [Paragon Surge](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paragon%20Surge) is full of dirty shenanigans, but I don't want any of that. Instead, the idea here is just to grant some flexibility from dreams. It doesn't grant Paragon Surge's attribute bonuses either, but the effect is similar so I used it as a price reference. With a limited time usage per day, it would be mostly used for things such as grabbing an skill unlock or an interesting, albeit situational out-of-combat feat that you could have taken anyway.

Does the 1d8 become 2d6? What about the additional 2d6 from sworn enemy? Does that also bump to 3d6?

If they both bump, this is crazy. Swearing an oath adds an additional +3 to hit and then does 5d6+7 damage? Jeez. It's like shooting a a tree trunk out of the bow.

(I think the Sworn Enemy increases the attack and damage bonus up 3 (from +2 to +5). Right?

0,0,6,6,"I've struggled for a while with dinosaurs in Pathfinder and how rare they are or aren't. I think it's really easy to bring in a bias from the real world where dinosaurs are extinct, and so in the game I originally felt as though they're REALLY rare. After some serious consideration, I've concluded that they're probably quite common, as far as things go.

That said, let me back it up a little and say that in my view, dinosaurs in pathfinder are about as common as running into an elephant. If you want to encounter an elephant it's probably not that difficult but you'll need to make an effort. You're not going to walk down the street and see an elephant (for most people anyway). You have to go where the elephants are. Now, most zoos will have an elephant and here is where I think dinosaurs are similar. If you imagine that dinosaurs existed in real life, it seems reasonable that you could go see them at the zoo. Maybe though similar to seeing koalas or kangaroos at the zoo though...may not be there all the time. It may be some rotation that every few years the local zoo would have that particular animal.

Lastly, considering that dinosaurs are extinct in real life and we know quite a bit about them, to me it stands to reason that in a world where they DO exist, basic knowledge of dinosaurs will be similar to what you know about any other type of animal you happen to be interested in: fish, cats, panthers, etc.

####Appearance  

This dry, hovering corpse’s chest is a prison of jagged ribs, within which is trapped a small tormented ghostly form.

####CR   11
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

**Devour Soul** (Su)

 By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer’s chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer’s destruction (or a spell deflection—see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell’s level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained—these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell Deflection** (Su)

 If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected—success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.

---- Extra Ecology from pfsrd ----

Devourers are the undead remnants of fiends and evil spellcasters who became lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse. Returning with warped bodies, alien sentience, and a hunger for life, devourers threaten all souls with a terrifying, tormented annihilation. These withered corpses stand 10 feet tall but weigh a mere 200 pounds.

Devourers’ origins are shrouded in mystery. While spellcasters may create them through the usage of create greater undead spells, exactly what occurs during these rituals is unclear, and it’s possible that devourers are more called into being than physically created—certainly it’s more than just a simple matter of animating a corpse.

Unlike many other forms of undead, devourers do not form spontaneously, nor do they breed or spawn. Rather, they begin as either one of two creatures: a terribly evil mortal spellcaster or an actual fiend. Those of either category who find themselves lost in the hinterlands of the cosmos sometimes return as devourers, their forms stretched and twisted into almost unrecognizable 10-foot-tall behemoths. They do not find their rebirth, their unholy transfiguration, in a specific place or plane. Rather, far beyond the knowledge and sight of mortals or outsiders, they experience some sort of transformative gnosis, realizing some infectious idea that simultaneously destroys and recreates them with a new form and a new hunger. Whether or not there might be something out there that actively calls to them, compulsively drawing them to its presence and making them into what they are, is anyone’s guess, yet it would explain why only evil outsiders and spellcasters seem to be susceptible, and also potentially why the strange mannerisms of the devourers who return to the planes seem more than simple madness. It’s even possible that some devourers themselves might not be aware of their precise origins, and their obsessions could be attempts to find their way back and discover who or what made them.

Those devourers created (or potentially called from elsewhere) by magic share all the traits and madness of their transformed kin, a fact that has confused spellcasters for generations. Some scholars have pointed out that specific details of these magical rituals have certain traits in common across all schools of magic and faith, leading some to believe that the ability to create devourers may have been introduced long ago as a single spell, perhaps provided by whatever malign forces lurk beyond the planes.

Another unusual facet of devourers’ existence is their strange response to a host of different spells, both powerful and weak. When one of these particular spells—mostly banishments or charms and compulsions—is cast on a devourer, there’s a chance that it instead causes the devourer to lose its hold on whatever spirit it has trapped in its chest, allowing the captive to escape off to its designated afterlife. No one is entirely sure why this is; perhaps the mind-affecting effects interact strangely with whatever madness or alien compulsions already drive the devourers, or the banishments can’t figure out where to send a creature that is effectively from beyond the planes. What is known, however, is that on those rare occasions when devourers have been cast back out to the space beyond reality, they have always found their way back with shocking ease.

Habitat &amp; Society
Like a black stain upon the proper flow of souls in the cosmos, devourers face revulsion from most other beings. They forsake their own spiritual evolution for undeath, and opportunistically feed upon other souls. A devourer’s hunger heavily colors its interaction with other races, and even those more powerful creatures who command devourers, or the lesser creatures who serve devourers, may find themselves under attack when a devourer grows tired of them or feels they’ve outlived their usefulness. Devourers are pragmatic to the extreme and highly secretive, but willing to serve greater masters should it serve their needs and offer a way to advance their current fixation.

Without occasionally feeding, devourers lose the use of their magical abilities, though in reality, the fact that a devourer can survive without a trapped soul for indefinite periods of time makes the “feeding” analogy break down. Instead, souls are simply capsules of energy that can be stored and used up, like batteries. It is perhaps for this reason that a devourer feeding has no orgiastic or sacramental aspect to it. To a devourer, consuming souls is simply a means to an end.

Devourers spend their undead existence pursuing bizarre and alien notions that make little to no sense to anyone else. Intensely fixated on certain things both philosophical and more concrete, their soul-hunting often seems to be of secondary importance to these less concrete goals. As a race born from planar explorers but denied such interplanar transportation magic themselves, devourers are obsessed with planar lore and gates, and seek ever more efficient ways to wander the cosmos on their strange errands. Altogether, their interests encompass an alien corpus of irrational, often blasphemous and dangerous knowledge, much of it presumably linked back to the mysterious force that led to their creation and which might continue to inf luence them.

Whether a devourer remembers its previous life or not, what it was prior to becoming a devourer may have some inf luence upon its undeath. Former clerics may sometimes arrange small, meaningless shrines or perform incomprehensible prayers, while former wizards may continue to collect bits of obscure lore or perform experiments to advance their knowledge. Each clue to their past, however, is invariably juxtaposed with other collections of bizarre ephemera, books written in the obsessive detail of hypergraphia, and even corpses left to rot next to others that were hung, carefully preserved, and painted with freakish, meaningless patterns.

In addition to being extremely rare, devourers almost always avoid each other, though it’s unclear whether this is simply a natural aversion to others of their kind or a necessary factor in fulfilling their arcane and far-reaching agendas. Perhaps it’s that devourers are heralds of their unknown creators, preparing to deliver the planes to their masters, and thus having more than one in a given area is unnecessary. Whatever the case, those who encounter even the most seemingly civilized and sane of devourers should remember that these soul-hungry undead appear to have been sent back not just as predators, but as direct agents of otherness.

Devourers are unholy abominations, gaunt giants who have seen beyond the trappings of mundane reality, and who have had some part of themselves twisted by the knowledge. Though skeletal and decayed, a devourer is no mere zombie, and goes about pursuing its alien goals while carrying a struggling, wailing soul in its hollow and cavernous rib cage, slowly consuming the captured spirit’s essence and condemning it to a fate worse than any hell.

While the Outer Planes are unimaginably vast, and in many ways can be considered to be infinite, there have long been questions about what lies beyond them. This is not merely the darkness and strange voids between distant stars on the Material Plane, but something fundamentally different—a beyond for the Great Beyond. Information about this otherness is almost completely unavailable, with even the gods seemingly deaf to most questions, yet there are always a few who to decide to see for themselves. When powerful fiends and evil spellcasters undertake this quest, some come back and report nothing but vast expanses of… well, nothing. Others don’t return at all. Yet some—the foulest ones, or those who become lost beyond the multiverse’s reaches—find something out there that changes them. These return with twisted, emaciated bodies and alien consciousnesses totally different from their original personalities, and bear an overwhelming hunger for soul energies, which they use to fuel their magical abilities. Though these maddened beings possess genius-level intellects, a strange ability to ignore many spells, and significant necromantic powers, most stories and legends ignore these aspects to focus instead on the wriggling, doomed spirits trapped and being digested within the devourers’ chests—the source of both their name and their infamy. Devourers can cause devastating damage with a touch, and those foes killed in this fashion find their souls forcibly drawn out and trapped inside the devourer’s body, where their essence is leeched away and used for spellcasting. Devourers can only consume a single soul at a time, absorbing it piece by piece as they utilize their magical abilities, and must finish off or relinquish one soul in order to consume and utilize another. For a trapped soul, the only real hope is that someone will target its captor with one of the eclectic collection of spells that can cause a devourer to momentarily lose control of the spirit, allowing the imprisoned soul to escape. Upon occasion, those wishing to obtain the release of a captive soul have attempted to bargain with the devourer, offering it a more powerful soul in exchange, but in these situations a devourer often simply burns up the last of its current soul energy in capturing the new morsel. Those souls that are successfully released and resurrected come back weaker and drained—and those destroyed completely by the devourer’s consumption cannot be brought back by anything less than the most powerful mortal magic.

Those rare few who peaceably encounter devourers—generally other powerful evil entities, or necromancers who call devourers into being through magic—all describe similar, disturbing traits. Though extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, devourers have a tendency to speak in weird riddles and half-sentences, babble in unknown languages, or respond to bizarre questions that no one had asked. Though devourers never discuss just who or what they’re talking to, many suspect their madness rises from a lingering connection to whatever sinister, alien entity or force made them what they are, and the devourers themselves sometimes let apparent titles slip, with appellations like the Dire Shepherd or the Wanderer Upon the Stair.

For all their madness, and despite their capacity for soul-annihilation, devourers are not creatures of mindless hunger, rampaging across the land. Instead they wander the planes, taking up new souls as needed but generally paying little attention to most other creatures, simply because their minds are elsewhere, occupied with more important things. The exception to this arises when devourers run across those individuals who, for one reason or another, play into their alien goals. Should they turn out to be foes, devourers show no mercy and leave nothing in their wake, not even the whispers of the dead.

Ultimately, devourers’ role in the cosmos remains a mystery, revealed individually and on a timescale not rushed by mortality. The whispers of places beyond the planes play across their atrophied synapses, calling them forth from the darkness—and it is to these places that they owe their only allegiance. Mortal necromancers and more powerful creatures may command devourers, but only the foolish claim to understand them.

0,0,25,6,"As per the title; GMs, when your party loses a character and the player rolls up a new one, what lengths will you go to to fit them into your campaign? More importantly, do you limit your characters' choices depending on the party's location in an official AP?

&amp;#x200B;

I ask because while playing our Rise of the Runelords Campaign (some setbacks but onto Book Six after almost three years!) we've hit a few areas where the DM has told us outright that we could be killed by anything we run into - most notably &gt;!the many wings of Runeforge!&lt; and most recently the &gt;!Lower City of Xin-Shalast!&lt; \- which, being a paranoid and being afflicted with altitis as I am, would give me an excuse to bring out my rolling roster of characters, each with backstories I can adjust to fit almost any situation. 

To clarify; we haven't died, aren't near death, nor in immediate danger - however the GM repeatedly stressed the potential for a TPK. 

But I was frustrated by the GM telling us that it would be nearly impossible to introduce a new character in either of these spoilered locations. We were offered the chance to play NPCs (if anything is guaranteed to make me spit nails it's the idea of playing an NPC), which made me curious; why couldn't we bring in new characters of our own? Many reasons and handwavium clouds were thrown around, ultimately boiling down to not being allowed to play X,Y,or Z -where X,Y and Z are pretty much any original character designs - and having to essentially put on whatever hat the GM decides to provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Curious, I took this conundrum to the other DMs I work with; I pitched a few ideas  that I felt were very flexible; the most mundane were escaped experiments, slaves or prisoners, rebellious recruits, that kind of thing; the most exotic was a pair of characters, each frozen in mystic amber and placed alongside one another, just waiting for any willing creature to provide the trigger word to unleash one of them from their ancient, millenia-old prison and join the party. Finally, the no-brainer-let's-just-play-now-roll-some-goddamn-dice option of a surprise teleportation/plane shift that drops a fresh character in the party's lap with some convenient excuse to work and bond with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every other GM I spoke to immediately came up with two or three fresh ideas off the top of *their* heads that were either better or more convenient for the campaign. On top of that, one GM completely ran away with my Demolition Man idea and would have incorporated BOTH frozen characters into the story. Another GM thought the escaped captives idea was a bit tame and encouraged me to instead play up the rebel route which would let me swing a few more plot-linked items into the party to open up some story parts we might have missed. I worry because our Runelords GM is a very, VERY creative dude, but for some reason didn't seem to want me bringing in a character of my own.

* Magical Music Box - This intricate wooden box has delicate gold filigree and a wind up key on the back, and if it is opened after having been wound-up a beautiful melody plays out. All creature's within a 40-ft radius are affected as if they failed their save against a [*Lullaby*](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lullaby) spell. Furthermore, all creatures within 10-ft of the music box must make a DC 13 Will save or fall asleep. The effects lasts for one minute. (after which the music box has wound down and the music stops.)

* Blood-Drinking Blade - A sword with a red, leather, hilt, the Blood-Drinking Blade comes with a scabbard that is covered in charms and wards. When removed from the scabbard the wielder must within the next minute draw blood from a living creature. If they fail to do so, they must make a DC 16 Will save or else turn the blade on their allies, or on themselves. This will save must be repeated once per minute until the blade draws blood. Willingly cutting oneself with the blade deals 1d4 damage, and inflicts 1 point of bleed damage. The blade has a +1 to attack rolls, a +2 to damage rolls, and inflicts 1 point of bleed damage on any target it hits. (In addition to its base stats. I used a katana, but there is no reason the same effect couldn't be applied to other edged weapons.)

* Twinned-Switching Cups - These silver goblets come as a pair and are decorated with a relief depicting two figures whose arms are entwined, each holding a goblet in their hand and drinking from them. The goblets are identical in appearance, even to the well-trained eye. When a liquid is poured in one goblet, if there is already liquid in the other they are magically switched. The effect is hard to spot, but a DC 22 Perception check will notice when the switch occurs. The goblets must be within 1 mile for this effect to occur, and if they are filled further away than 1 mile and then brought closer together, the liquids inside will switch.

There's one other player in the group but so far he seems fine with the above ideas being at the table.

My question is, how should I shift my design philosophy as GM to better facilitate players that don't want to be heroes? I've already told them that PVP must still be agreed upon and that they should still work as a team so I don't see any outright red flags, but I still wanna be prepared for how the dynamic might otherwise change. 

I've seen advice online that says that usually heroes are reactive while villains are proactive. Is it the other way around if I have evil aligned players, or should I count on the players to be more proactive? If it's the latter, how would I prepare content ahead of time if they're the ones with a proactive plan?",Pathfinder_RPG,My Players Don't Want To Be Heroes

0,0,160,95,"Hello everyone, made a throw away account for this since the topic could be a little sensitive.  


I've been DM'ing for a group for a fair bit of time now for a very diverse group of players.  For the most part, everyone gets along with only the occasional spat during bad days. However, one of our players, a gay male has two habits that several of the other players have taken note of and has at times been poked fun of, but it rears its head over and over and makes me and others uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

The first is directly related to his interaction with male npcs.  He flirts or makes passes at all of them. If that was it I wouldn't mind at all, but when he gets turned down or it becomes clear that the NPC is interested in women over men or just not interested in him, he starts pouting in and out of game (often accompanying this by posting gifs of crying usually the David Tennant in the rain meme or something else and this can go on for as long as an hour or more after the event.  He's had ample opportunities to flirt with other gay characters, has gone on several dates that were all played out and slept with three, so I'm giving him situations to 'be himself'.

&amp;#x200B;

That last sentence ties into the second.  Any time any of the other players who are either straight or lesbian become romantic, flirt or otherwise...he becomes very dismissive of everything they do and often says something along the lines of ""Ugh, straight people.""  Or just 'gross' when the lesbian has her turn.  The last time this happened I didn't say anything but I have no desire to constantly deal with it, especially not after I've talked with him and other players have talked to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help me with this?  I don't want to kick him from the group but because I'm straight he tends to downplay my opinions on sexuality or discomfort when someone is insulting mine and I don't want to drop the problem onto our trans player's lap to explain to him why its not cool.  I'm bad at making metaphors or points for this topic, does anyone have a way that can get through to him?",Pathfinder_RPG,Concern with a Player's Reactions towards other's sexuality.

So currently I am a Vigilante with the Serial Killer Archetype, build around Sap Feats and using intimidate and Twisting Fear to deal a fair amount of single target damage. Of course, the build is a bit limited to flanking, sneak attacks, and shut down hard by anything immune to fear. And with the chance to rebuilt my character I'm wondering if there is something else I could do.

One thought is the Inspired Blade and make an actual Blackjack build, focus on the rapier and all that, maybe a dip in Vigilante to keep the two personas. But he becomes a completely different character, and loses a lot of the bonuses that come with being a Vigilante, such as the social ability I've invested in disguise.

Another is changing up my Vigilante build to be a bit more rogue like instead of Sap Focused, and just go for classic sneak attacks, though I will miss twisting fear being part of my every attack.

I'm building Pathfinder 1e spell reference site. Mainly for mobile use.

&amp;#x200B;

[**scrollbear.com**](https://scrollbear.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm DMing for a few years for my friends. And during that time I tried to find all sorts of methods that would reduce the time to check the rules and other staff. On games I constantly use online references, such as Archives of Nethys or d20pfsrd. But I dm games with a laptop, so for me it's more comfortable than for my players.

All of my players are using  paper characters sheets. And the biggest problem with that was to manage spell slots and spell descriptions. And the above-mentioned reference sites are not the most convenient for mobile navigation. In the end, I decided to make my own website that would help with this. Something where you can quickly choose or find the right spell.

## Site

The site itself I tried to make equally convenient for desktop or mobile. Also, this site works in offline, which can sometimes be useful.

I didn't do any login or authorization so all selected options are saved on the device like in native apps. Maybe someday I will add something to synchronize data from different devices.

## Spell Reference

For now you can add spells into favorite, search by name, class or school of magic. In the future, I plan to add more filters (and perhaps the choice of source books, so you can choose only core book for example).

## Spellbook

My players and I used to use google sheets to track prepared spells and spellbooks. Now I transferred the same mechanics to my site. But some things are missing. No special slots, like domain, or selected schools of magic. And there is no possibility to prepare spells with metamagic.

But currently it's still enough for our games and when I find the time I will try to add other functionality.

## 

I really like to play Pathfinder. Especially because there are so many options, variety and depth. But because of all this, it is very difficult to manage different elements of the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I make this site for myself and my players. But maybe it will be useful to other players.

Companion: Polar Kamadan, adjusted to be appropriate to lvl.  Medium size, flies, no breath weapon.

What if the weapon has no enhancement bonus? Or, what if the weapon is Masterwork and therefore only has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and none on damage? Does it just gain a +2 enhancement bonus (in which case is it now a magical weapon)?

&amp;#x200B;

One interpretation might be that, since it has no enhancement bonus to modify, the weapon does not gain the +2 enhancement bonus increase (or a masterwork weapon would only gain the increase on attack rolls). But another interpretation would say that, just because it currently has no enhancement bonuses does not mean you can't add the +2, which would give mundane weapons a +2 on attack and damage (masterworks would have a +3 attack and a +2 damage).

&amp;#x200B;

When I initially read the ability, I interpreted it in the former sense. I am pretty sure that the bane weapon special ability was not intended to be used on weapons that did not already have an enhancement bonus on both attack and damage. Therefore, the inquisitor's class feature is sort of bending the rules a bit. However, I don't want to unintentionally nerf an ability due to my own misinterpretation.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the general consensus on this? I looked around online a bit and didn't really find what I was looking for.",Pathfinder_RPG,(1E) Inquisitor's Bane Question

####Appearance  

####CR 4  
#####Alignment:  CN
#####Size:   Small
####Special Abilities  

Blood-Freezing Howl (Su) As a standard action, a voonith can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for an additional 1d6 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against a voonith’s howl is immune to the same voonith’s howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Cunning and aggressive, vooniths are amphibious nocturnal predators with voracious appetites and mild intelligence. A voonith’s howl is said to freeze the blood and is more than capable of stopping a creature in its tracks. Vooniths usually howl when they see prey too far away from the water’s edge to ambush. While the vooniths are native to the strange Dimension of Dream, many have found their way out of that realm and into the waking world to take up lairs in the swampy fens and remote coastlines of the world. How the vooniths originally managed to make this transition between worlds is unclear.

Although they look like little more than wild beasts, vooniths are actually rather intelligent. While certainly not as sharp as the average human, a voonith is smart enough to know how to speak and often does so with others of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate with other creatures, giving rise to the misconception that they’re little more than dumb animals, but on occasion, travelers in swampy regions tell tales of overhearing strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few who know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand these words, although understanding of what the vooniths whisper in the night when they think no one else can hear is not always for the best.

While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense of humor, and take great pleasure in concocting violent poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in which non-voonith creatures—particularly humans, cats, and gnomes—meet gory and ironic fates are the most entertaining to vooniths. Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conflict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who befriend travelers often escort them, quietly and unseen, through dangerous bogs, and when such travelers fall prey to other dangers of the swamp, a friendly voonith will provide what aid it can.

Vooniths are 4 feet long and weigh 70 pounds, yet rumors tell of vooniths that have grown to much larger sizes than this.

0,0,4,3,"So I got a group of novice-regular players together for my first time GMing a module. We wanted something that could be a one-off or intro to a longer adventure, so I picked up Crypt of the Everflame since there a sequels to it we could carry on if everybody had fun. Fast-forward to our first session and I find out that two of the players were familiar with the module already and one had played parts of it. They all still wanted to play, but I can tell they're kind of anticipating what comes next. We made it to the crypt in the first session before stopping, so I decided to take the extra time to make some changes to the adventure. They're not big, but little things to keep it interesting and surprise the players who know what's coming. I'll list the chages I've made, please let me know what you think if you have any suggestions on more changes. 

1. In the pit trap room I've changed the pit traps to hidden floor tiles that, when triggered, fore blunted arrows. It's the same idea as the pits, but instead of the four switched which is obvious if you know what to look for, they have to find four tiles that are buttons but don't trigger traps, those will act as switches for the door. 

2. Instead of a barricaded door that Roldare is hiding behind, I made it a trap door in the ground they have to find. 

3. Considering making the Kassen's blades trap actually be living statues they have to fight, still with blunted swords. Might be slight overkill though. 

4. Draugs instead of skeletons in the second skeleton fights. 

5. A direct bat, or pair of dire bats, instead of bat swarms on the lower level. 

6. In the flooded room with electrified moss, replace the moss with electric eels. 

These are just minor changes and would love some input on ideas or other changes GMs have made. I also really want to think of a way to change up the key pool, but am drawing a blank. Also feel free to use any of these if you're running the adventure and want to spice it up. ",Pathfinder_RPG,Rewriting Crypt of the Everflame

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have two main issues to solve:

* *Which inquisition should I take?* Clandestine seems like an auto-pick, but Heresy lets me utilise Intimidate much much better. 
* *Should I add the Sanctified Slayer archetype?* Still unsure whether Judgements or Studied Target + Sneak Attack are better for him.  


Furthermore, but not pressing:

* *What's the best way to get DEX to damage for him?* Three levels of Unchained Rogue (with the Rake archetype he could become a nice intimidator)? 8k gold for an Agile weapon? Some feat chain? 
* *Is the size penalty for Intimidate based on actual or perceived size?* So a small creature appearing medium via e.g. Alter Self suffers the -4 penalty against medium sized targets?

0,0,12,2,"To be clear, I am not starting this as a debate on **IF** they are stackable. I understand that, be RAW, they would not stack because it doesn't *explicitly* say so. However, by RAI, I am unsure of whether a Monk's unarmed damage stacks with the Brawler's unarmed damage. Many things kind of go for it(few thoughts listed below). So I am curious what everyone's opinions are on allowing it to stack.

I have read from a few other forum posts randomly about people debating {A)they should stack, B) they don't stack, C)even if they don't, it wouldn't be game breaking.} but none of them really have anything definitive or better than the other reasoning wise, for allowing it or not, just a bunch of arguing over what the person believes. 


Arguments for why I might allow it:
---Both classes have the same progression. The damage intended for a full monk or full brawler would be the same, so stacking doesn't make anything 'unbalanced' there, or else they'd be unbalanced on just a plain 20 monk.
---If someone wanted to multiclass into both(whatever merits there may be), the main reason they would want to do so is most likely to be a character that uses there fists for combat, not weapons, so why punish it?
---Martial Training allows you to qualify for feats as if her brawler levels were fighter and monk levels(seemingly saying that if you multiclassed as a 4 brawler/4 monk, you would essentially meaning you would be a 4monk/4monk-AKA an 8 monk- for a feat that had monk 8 as a prerequisite--*note, I am not referring to anything specifically, just an example*). It then goes on to say they [brawler levels] ""also count as a both fighter and a monk for feats and magic items"". The most used example discussed being monk robes. [Though I wouldn't allow the progression to get past a level 20 monk's with monk robes-FE a 20 monk + monk robes  would NOT = 25 Monk unarmed damage - and I don't think there is anything like that anyway.]. Though it also doesn't specify using this for features, so I understand the argument against it.
---Sneak attack damage is said to stack, but the idea behind the stacking doesn't seem that different to me. Extra damage, granted by the same class feature, just by separate classes. Sure, one is *added* to your damage under certain conditions (though, arguably not hard conditions), whereas the other just *sets* your base damage. Honestly, sneak attack stacks faster, and to a higher total anyway: every 2 levels, and extra d6, to a max of 10d6, vs a medium creatures unarmed damage: every 4 levels, moving up 1 category, to a max of 2d10. 

Why I might not:
---Monastic  Legacy-lets you count non-monk levels(every 4) as if they were monk levels, to progress unarmed damage. If it wasn't for the prerequisite for Still Mind, I would allow this to be the way to do the above, but it is only applicable to monks with Still Mind. Meaning even some archetypes can't get it.-Which isn't quite the same as minimum monk level x prerequisite(which is what I think this should be instead-monk lvl3).
---Allowing this to happen opens up the ""pandora's box' of new ways of becoming abusable, but I think most things can be if you try hard enough...so lets not *focus* on that. ",Pathfinder_RPG,Thoughts on allowing Monk/Brawler unarmed damage to stack?

0,0,14,0,"Being a DM I'm always looking for ways to improve and enhance the pathfinder experience for my table, and as a result I run quite a few house-rules at my table (free power-attack, starting level 4 you die at negative double your con score, all three of hp / skill-rank / fcb every level, etc). I love Pathfinder, but I think there's definitely some room for improvement. One of the things that's always bugged me is how little bonus it is to have flanking on a creature, particularly as you get to higher levels. To me, flanking an enemy (or being flanked) should be much bigger boon to the attackers than a flat +2 attack, and should reflect how much the pc/creature relies on superior mobility and dexterity. And a flat +2 just doesn't express that like I think it should, and it doesn't scale as your PC's get deadlier and level up.

The most reasonable and somewhat balanced solution I've thought of is to have all flanking attacks made against flat-footed AC. I know ""realism"" isn't necessarily a big part of the mechanics of this game, but the switch to flat-footed works well visually with creatures that are especially nimble vs large and clumsy. A pair of guys with flanking against say, an [elephant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant), get basically no advantage on their attack. Which makes sense. Fred standing on the other side isn't going to make it any easier for me to hit this big-ass animal. As opposed to getting flanking on something nimble and fast, like a swashbuckler, which seems like having flanking on should provide a much larger benefit, as you've negated his speed/dexterity advantage. I realize this probably has some big oversight that I'm not thinking of, and I also realize it would skew the balance of certain feats/abilities like [stance of the xorn](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/stance-of-the-xorn-combat/) for instance.

## Elven Spirit

Although you are of mixed heritage, you are closer to your elven relatives and the magic in their blood flows freely in your veins.

**Prerequisite**: Half-elf.

**Benefit**: You possess the elven magic racial trait of the elves, granting you a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition, you receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties of magic items. Alternatively, you can instead gain ***any one racial trait that elves can exchange for the elven magic racial trait.***

**Special**: You can only take this feat at 1st level. If you take this feat, you cannot take the Human Spirit feat.

**Lightbringer**: Many elves revere the sun, moon, and stars, but some are literally infused with the radiant power of the heavens. Elves with this racial trait are ***immune to light-based blindness*** and dazzle effects, and are treated as one level higher when determining the effects of any light-based spell or effect they cast (including spell-like and supernatural abilities). Elves with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher may use *light* at will as a spell-like ability. This racial trait replaces the elven immunities and ***elven magic*** racial traits.

0,0,30,11,"Good day you all

I am building a paladin for a Kingmaker campaign and for a change I have decided to try mounted build but I run into several dilemmas and grey rule areas and I need your sagely advice.

Let’s start by saying that Leadership is for now off the table and this not a PFS game. I also try to play it by RAW although I can always ask nicely the GM as a last resort

\-----

**1)** **Problem**: paladins don’t get a mount at lvl 1Solution: buy a combat trained Heavy horse or if DM allows it a combat trained Bison. A trait for more gold will be needed.

**2)** **Problem**: Medium Paladins have very limited selection of Divine bond mounts.Solution: the feat [Monstrous Mount](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/monstrous-mount/) give’s a Griffin however it requires 2 feats at lvl 5 and 7 to make it worthwhile. Other feats exist such as [Beast Rider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/beast-rider-orc-half-orc)(Orc/Half-Orc) that requires lvl 7 and is race specific or [Wolf Rider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/wolf-rider/), though I can’t say I am impressed by either.

**3)** **Problem:** For animal companions that lack fly speed it’s is annoyingly difficult to give them a way to “fly” as a paladin. You either need i) some expensive magic item that makes it more of a late game thing and even then it might need to be costume made to be usable by your mount, ii) lose actions and spellslots to cast a spell that allows it to fly (as a paladin I think there is one at lvl 3 (Sky Steed) and maybe angelic aspect greater (via share spells) or iii) beg a friendly caster if one is part of your team to use their resourses.

**4)** **Problem**: mounted combat requires to dump skillpoints to two skills not really useful otherwise (ride &amp; handle animal) and for a paladin that might want to dump Int that’s more than he might have! Also feat wise it requires quite a lot especially if you want to have other fun feats like **Fey Foundling** or **Power Attack** or **Monstrous mount** and family, making Human seem like a one way.Solution: for skill points not really any. Int must at minimum be 10, the higher the better to have things to do when not fighting. Human will give you a skill point and a lvl 1 feat.Another way to go is to ignore the [spirited charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spirited-charge-combat/) route and Dip 1 lvl into Sohei for [Mounted skirmisher](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mounted-skirmisher-combat/) ( if you can make sweet eyes yo your GM to allow an Unchained Sohei from everyman’s conversion even better).

**5)** **Problem**: Animal Companions scale very badly at middle to higher LvLSolution: i) Deal with it, use it only as a means of transport/movement and consider your character as having pounce/flight ii) try to make your animal companion matter at late game with feats (like teamwork ones). But I think you only delay the inevitable that way. III) *Shenanigans!* Use 2 feats to get [Animal Ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/animal-ally). By raw as long as your divine bond mount is one that [Animal Ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/animal-ally) grants then your “Druid” level stuck for an Umber mount effect. There has been no FAQ as far as I know and only a ruling for PFS. I personally don’t find it too cheesy as you are basically restricted to a horse (that doesn’t fly nor has pounce) and even at lvl 20 (assuming you can progress the animal beyond the chart) It is comparable to an NPC warrior and you have used 2 feats. With **Beast rider** or **monstrous mount** it will worth more but then that’s another feat investment from you.

\--------

**1)** **Dilemma**: Is it worth using the archetype [Shining Knight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin/archetypes/paizo-paladin-archetypes/shining-knight/)? Basically you lose the ability to share your smites for the ability to allow your mount to benefit from your divine grace. As a side effect of losing your  11th lvl ability 9 (Aura of Justice) you can’t take *oath of vengeance* which is one of the best paladins archetypes (it even makes Rping a tad easier).

\-------

**1)** **Rule question:** the [Mammoth Lance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/specific-magic-weapons/mammoth-lance/) requires your mount to be an animal  i) At 11 lvl the animal companion becomes a magical beast (paladin divine bond) but I assume it’s only  counts so for which spells affect it thus you can use the lance normally  ii)  *assuming you can’t, can you use UMD to allow other kind of mounts as well?*

**2)** **Rule question:** Would “**Monstrous** **Mount**” affect the animal companion gained from “**Animal Ally**”. The prerequisites normally would not let you qualify but you do qualify from the paladins divine bond mount.

**3)** **Rule question:** a Griffin from “**Monstrous Mount**” is an *animal type or a magical beast type*? I would lean towards animal based on the feat’s text. This affects what spell interacts with it, effects such as bane and the mammoth lance so it is quite important.

\-------

Possible build if everything works as I think it does

**Race**: human | **stats**: 16 14 12 10 8 16+2 (point buy 25) (as it’s a kingmaker campaign and I hope to use the mammoth lance more emphasis on cha will be placed)

**Mount**: combat trained Bison or combat trained heavy horse (hopefully will survive to lvl 4)

**Feats:**LvL 1: fey foundling | human bonus feat: Nature Soul,

LvL 3: (something… craft wondrous maybe?)

LvL 4: retrain lvl 3 feat to Animal Ally

LvL 5: Monstrous mount -&gt; Griffin (animal companion is a lvl 7 (char lvl 5-2 from Animal Ally + 5 from Divine bond and it only gets better from her on)

LvL 7: Monstrous mount mastery | Dip 1 lvl Sohei for Mounted Skirmisher

LvL 9: Power attack (lol I know way too late)

Build is complete more or less. Good feats would be beast totem, evolved companion crafting feats to help equip both the char and the mount

\-------

I would really appreciate if you could:

1. answer the rule questions I have
2. Give your insight on the Shining knight archetype (worth it or not)
3. And suggest better solutions to the problems I encounter while trying to make a paladin mounted build. In particular ways to permanently grant the ability of flight to the mount (by lvl 5 to 7) would appreciated

Reminder: No leadership and family. Everything else goes with a priority on being Raw and first party material.

I have kids and homeschool, and I'm fairly evangelistic about kids and RPGs. As a result, I spend a decent amount of time in the Beginner Box. I really like the PFS kids track lessons for teaching new kids to play. For anyone unfamiliar, they use the Beginner Box Bash Demos (BBBD) to reinforce lessons about dice, classes, skills, etc. Each of the BBBD has a map tile pack associated with it, and I'd love to get those map tile packs, but I feel like if I'm just using them for that, even if I run a new group of kids through them every year, I'm barely using these map tiles that I paid money for (especially since most BBBD only use 1-2 tiles out of the pack). *So, my question is, do any of you know of any resources that make use of the map tile sets?* As an example, the Academy of Secrets adventure module uses the Magic Academy map tiles as the maps for the entire adventure (which is why I chose that set of map tiles to buy first). 

The map tile packs, in order of use in the Kids Track are: Ruins, Dungeon Sites, Magic Academy (not worried about this one), Crypts. Other BBBD map packs: Ice Cavern, Farmstead, Lost Island, Palace, Ship's Cabin.

The second Beginner Box adventure that can be found in the Beginner Box GM kit uses the Mines map pack. 

To be clear, I'm not *only* interested in Beginner Box adventures, though I'm always interested in adding to my beginner adventure collection. Mostly, I just want to be able to justify to myself buying the map packs that I will use first with the Beginner Box stuff. And I know I could come up with my own stuff to use them, or use them for random encounters or whatever, but I haven't made time for creating my own adventures since 3e D&amp;D came out (mostly after some jokes from my players about how all my adventures involved people being kidnapped).

####Ecology  

The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh—in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask.


Oni are a race of evil spirits, native to the Material Plane, that manifest physical bodies based upon the shapes and desires of humanoid mortals. In pure spirit form, an oni is nothing but a disembodied evil longing for the sins of the flesh. In this form, oni are harmless and invisible. The majority of these bodiless oni were once kami who failed their wards, or more often, who deliberately abandoned them. As punishment, they were stripped of their ability to form a physical body and then cast into the void. Rarely, a mortal creature's soul can become a disembodied oni upon death, or in even rarer cases, after a truly evil individual has undergone a particularly vile ritual that ends in suicide. These oni are more often destined for positions of great power and strength than most. 

Eventually, an oni's spirit manifests a physical body on the Material Plane. The methods by which this may occur vary, but the process generally takes place in areas already despoiled by sin, tragedy, or cruelty. The type of oni a spirit transforms into is influenced by a wide variety of variables, ranging from the nature of what the oni spirit was before to the location where it is reborn into the realm of flesh and blood. Once an oni manifests its physical body, that body becomes its true form for the rest of its life—all oni are shapechangers, but this original form is the form in which they are born and the form they revert to upon death. 

An oni's true form is always similar to that of a specific type of humanoid, save that it is always deformed and monstrous to look upon. Tusks, additional eyes, or strangely colored skin are common physical attributes. Yet while they have hideous forms, all oni are capable of changing their shape to assume forms more pleasant to the civilized eye. The type of shapes an oni can assume depend upon its species, but all can transform into some form of humanoid. Oni use this ability to infiltrate humanoid societies, either to prey upon the weak or to rule them in disguise. 

In order to understand oni, it is important to consider that most of these beings were once spirits tasked with protecting a material realm they now believe is undeserving of such care and concern—indeed, the physical world is to be dominated and consumed. They arrive in physical form starved for sensory experience, and never fully sate their desire to gorge on such experiences. Most oni seek to attain positions of leadership and power, often in the guise of a normal humanoid, in order to secure a never-ending supply of sensory experiences. It is also important to understand that oni's immoderation is also motivated by their corrupted and evil natures—that is, no pleasure is more enjoyable than one that deprives or wounds another. 

Oni retain their hatred of the kami upon reentering the Material Plane as physical creatures, and often their depredations and violations of the world can be directly tied to their efforts to destroy kami or the kami's works. Oni tend not to congregate with others of their kind, being most comfortable in positions of leadership over enslaved or oppressed societies populated by humanoids they can masquerade as. Yet, at times, particularly powerful oni abandon this mindset and instead gather to their side entire legions of oni drawn from all types. The oni known collectively as the yai—oni with an affinity for true giants—are most often responsible for such actions, and when a yai builds such an army of oni, the humanoid lands shake with terror. 

Theoretically, as many types of oni exist as there are types of humanoids, although in reality, certain types of oni are much more populous than others. The ogre mage, an oni associated with ogres, is the best-known and most commonly encountered type of oni, for reasons that still send scholars of oni lore into spiraling arguments with seemingly no end. Beyond the oni detailed on the following pages, the atamahuta (ettins), ja noi (hobgoblins), nogitsune (kitsune), and wind yai (cloud giants) are relatively well known. Oni with associations to bugbears, great cyclopes, stone giants, trolls, troglodytes, and other races exist as well. And above even the mighty void yai there exist the oni demigods—entities of nearly incomprehensible power known as the oni daimyo.

0,0,25,8,"TL/DR: We have to fight a horned devil and don’t know how we are going to win. Help!

My party is soon to be facing off against a horned devil and I’m hoping we can prevail with some help from you folks! Here’s some info on our party:

Me: Level 10 sorcerer (sorcerer 6/ dragon disciple 4)

PC: level 10 paladin

PC: level 10 rogue

NPC: level 10 alchemist

NPC: unknown level rock/lava golem thing

Gear: 

I don’t have much in the way of items other than things boosting my stats since I mainly cast spells but I do have 1749 platinum to spend. 

Here are my spells:

0 level: Acid Splash, Detect Magic, Read Magic, Light, Ray of Frost, Disrupt Undead, Mending, Arcane Mark. 

1st level: Protection from Evil, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shocking Grasp, Vanish. 

2nd level: Resist Energy, Create Pit, Flaming Sphere, Blur, Knock. 

3rd level: Dispel Magic, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Fly. 

4th level: Dimension Door, Greater Invisibility, and one more open slot that I have yet to pick. 

Our paladin has a long sword of quickening and blast of some kind, a shield with righteous might, and a bunch of stuff to boost his strength. 

Our rogue mainly uses a bow which is a +2 dragons bane bow. 

Our two NPC’s are played by our DM so all I know is the alchemist has some sort of gun and some grenade type thrown weapons. 

Typical strategy:

So far our usual strategy is for me to use Greater Invisibility on our rogue while she shoots, buff our paladin’s AC, then throw fireballs and lightning bolts while our paladin swings away. 

So here’s our issue, the horned devil’s AC is very high, even with all of our stuff, it would be difficult for our party to hit. Also, I’ve taken a lot of fire spells because of my characters back story and this devil is resistant to fire so I’m not sure how much help I’d be. In addition to those things, he has DR/good and none of us have good weapons or spells aside from our paladins healing spells which I think we are going to need. 

My only hope right now is to plead with our paladin’s deity to bless our weapons with the good property which I don’t think the DM will actually do and the paladin’s church doesn’t like us and won’t help. 

Needless to say we are in for a tough fight where some of us might die. Any tips or strategies you guys have would be really helpful! Thank you!

0,0,2,1,"So before I get to anything else, what levels change the game significantly? 5, 10, 15?

I had an idea for a campaign I want to run, where it starts off with the players working for some organization (or independently), wandering throughout a kingdom and looking into some strange goings-on. 

At about level... 5, I think is the first big change, they find out a bit of the larger scope, and discover that there's some 7 relics that they should collect, probably when they come across the first one. Each relic does something minor but useful, such as ""Cure light wounds X times per day,"" and there's several groups trying to hunt them down because collecting them all would supposedly allow one to become a god - and by finding a relic of their own, the players land on the radar of these groups (each an adventuring party in their own right). The players may or may not come into direct conflict with these groups, but the groups will at least hire people/use political maneuvering to try to get the players off the trail of the 7 relics. A few of these will be in a dungeon beneath the kingdom, but a few will be in the hands of these groups, which is why they acknowledge each other - these groups also know much more about what's going on than the players do, at least at first, but not the full truth.

The players should come across the sixth relic at around level 10, and the final relic will be owned by a Nightwalker at the bottom of the dungeon, a climactic boss fight for this segment. Once the players defeat the Nightwalker (or negate it somehow) and collect the seven relics, an angel will descend upon the capital city to await their arrival.

Once the players meet the angel, it will reveal a horrible truth about the world - it's been ravaged by Nightshades, the players have proven that mortals are ready to take them on, and this kingdom was the last bastion of mortals in this reality, and then it will shatter the barrier keeping the kingdom separate from the rest of the world, making the world a bigger place for the players to match their new powers.

I don't have an idea for how to expand the world again at level 15, though. Bring back the ascension to godhood thing, with the players recreating the dying world as they go and ushering in an age of heroism?

So a few questions: Would it be better to expand the world a level before the big change level, so the players grow into an appropriate power level for the new thing, or a session into the new level, so players have had a chance to play with their new powers before the world suddenly becomes a more threatening place? I don't think I want things to exactly coincide.

0,0,156,163,"I brought it up that I'd like to see my favorite lore series do a video on firearms in Golarion because most people don't seem to know much about it (I'll admit, I was the same kneejerk ""Eww, guns in a fantasy game, NO!"" type player until I read up on it).  I figured ""Why wait?  I can do it myself!""  So, here we are.  My attempt at explaining the lore and the place in the setting behind firearms.

---

Guns are contentious.  Most people in a fantasy game like D&amp;D or Pathfinder take one look at them and go ""Eww, no!"" like someone had just asked to have unlimited wishes.  Even though in our real life history we've had guns for over a thousand years, the fact they weren't in things like Tolkien's work (mostly, he did mention black powder bombs) means most people don't associate them with fantasy in general.  After all, why create dangerous early firearms when its so much easier to just learn to shoot fire directly from your fingertips?

To answer this, we need to visit the region guns were invented in, namely the city-state of Alkenstar located in the Mana Wastes, and the dwarven hold there called Dongun Hold.  Now, the Mana Wastes lie between the nations of Nex and Geb, which themselves lie south of Osirion on the lower continent of Garund.  Nex and Geb were involved in a huge magical war from roughly -800 to 500 AR.  During which the battles got so bad that reality itself was damaged to the point it created vast tracks of magic deadzones.

The dwarves in Dongun Hold were right in the middle of it, and sealed themselves in to protect themselves during the war (rumor has it the magic they used to seal themselves off is what reacted with the magics Geb and Nex were throwing around to create the first deadzone).  In the thousands of years that followed, these dwarves invented the first guns due to the fact they had no magic (gotta find better ways to kill each other somehow, I suppose).  In 4588 AR a criminal by the name of Alkenstar fled into the Mana Wastes and ended up founding a city over the dwarven hold that shared his name.  They learned of the manufacture of guns from the dwarves during trade, and by 4620 AR had founded the Gunworks to officially start producing firearms to protect themselves from the various monsters and other threats (like the Gorilla King, seriously, look that one up!).  Due to intentionally low production rates in the Gunworks, 90% of all firearms created in Alkenstar STAY in Alkenstar, giving them a stranglehold on the technology (the Gunworks intentionally only produce one firearm a day normally specifically to limit availability).

The current year in default Golarion is 4710, meaning knowledge of the existence of guns by the outside world has only been around for less than a century, and even then it has been little more than a trickle of actual product.  Which means much of what is available in the Inner Sea region we are familiar with has likely been smuggled out of Alkenstar, is a more locally crafted copy, or is one of the rare ultra-markup trade goods trickling out of the southern region.

To put this in perspective, that means the only mass production center of guns in the setting is cranking out less than 50 individual weapons PER YEAR for export, which are having to be carried basically from the equivalent of Ethiopia to Europe on foot and by sailing ship.  Most of which are then likely being kept in private collections by wealthy collectors of rare and exotic items.  With availability this low, the gunslingers out there probably all know each other by name.

So there we go, a quick overview of guns in Golarion.  From how they came to be (an alternative to magic from a region where magic doesn't exist) to why they're still so rare (extremely low supply and extremely recent development on the world stage).",Pathfinder_RPG,Lore: Guns in Golarion

He is a Tiefling, a Baron from Cheliax, banished and disgraced for his Demonic bloodline, though his appearance is more of a Devil (red skin, horns, etc.). 

Now, in our current predicament, the Asmodean Church has sided with the tyrant Queen, and the PCs need to sever that connection to secure power &amp; favor so they can depose the Queen. The problem is, they really have no way to actually make this happen, certainly not in the timeframe they need it to.

So I decided to mine the PCs backstory and use him as the method to do it, since he's Chelaxian and Asmodean Church is from Cheliax, and hopefully we can find something there. So I had to go back and do some writing, and this Demonic thing is really killing a lot of the potential lore I can see here, because it knocks out most anything I might want to do (Contract Devils, broken pacts, using Hell to leverage the Church, etc.) since Demons do none of that.

I've settled on one thing: I want to use Baphomet here. The Demon Lord branded by Asmodeus and bearing a permanent grudge against him. The most I've come up with, though, is the Tiefling PC's ancestor bargaining his family line away, and the Tiefling being the end result of that, a spawn born in the image of Asmodeus but with the taint of Demons, however I can't really figure out how this, or his Barony &amp; family back home in Cheliax might be used or sacrificed in order to make this goal happen for the PCs.

But now it’s been years since I’ve been on the player side of the game (not actually but the games where I am a player, it’s usually a one-off or never picked up again) and honestly, I’m starting to become tired of being the GM. 

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love being a GM and I’ve made some pretty interesting things for my group but it’s bee so long since I’ve been able to build and develop a character of my own instead of having an interesting np for a day or two. 

Have any of you had a burnout? If so, how have you dealt with it?

0,0,20,5,"As the title says, I'm new to GMing and my players are about to reach the 'boss' of the first major arc of the campaign. Originally, I had planned to throw a single high-difficulty creature at them but after reading a few discussions and advice posts on GM guides and forums, I decided that a single powerful unit wasn't the way to go.

Now I'm at a loss as to how to make the final fight seen climatic and challenging without killing them outright. Suggestions?

For context, the boss fight will happen in the highest room of a necromancer's tower, and the necromancer will escape before the fight begins by using dimension door after gloating/ranting at the party.",Pathfinder_RPG,"New GM here, how do you make a boss encounter?"
0,0,43,0,"So, I am GM-ing a homebrewed campaign. My players decided to enter a mysterious mansion which was inhabited by a very powerful and evil Lord. His name was the 10000 stats man (Mount and blade joke)  and died 647 years ago. The mansion is surrounded by a field that stops everything from entering it. Besides the magic field there are tall dark walls covered in blades so that scaling the walls is impossible. The gate to the mansion is not a normal gate but 10 blades that move back and forth and cut everything that tries to enter. They dig a tunnel and got inside. Even though it was day time the mansion's garden is in constant darkness and fog. Inside that garden there are living statues that cannot be destroyed and if they touch you they kill you. (The weeping angels from Dr. Who) You can stop them only by continuously looking at them. 

They get inside. Inside there are living armours that try to get one player inside them then turn him into a Graveknight. Once the armour is destroyed it releases a Will o' Whisp.  Their fight is hard and one player is nearly killed. Amongst living statues and living suits of armour there were normal and ""door mimics"", statues possessed by ghostly creatures and an ancient entity that has been guarding the mansion since the lord died. 

I think that a mansion covered in blades and eternal night with so many dangerous creatures is an obvious sign that the place has two gimmicks. 

1) Enemies are hidden from sight or are looking like objects. 

2)The mansion is lethal and death could come any time. In both the statues and living armour encounters one or more players were nearly killed. Added to the inherent danger of the monsters there is the ancient presence which is a modified Spectator adapted to work as a boss in pathfinder. 

Finally. The players arrive before a door that has ""DANGER"" written all over, literally. They still enter. The room is a large greenhouse inside the house. The trees are dead and what were once ponds turned to acid (because of the evil magic inside the mansion). What looks like puddles are actually deep basins but because of the darkness and colouration of the acid they cannot deduce how deep the puddles actually are. On the opposite side of the room there is a door with the word ""RUN"" written all over illuminated by a torch. 

The party has 3 spell casters,  a rogue and a barbarian.... 

Instead of sending the barbarian first the druid goes first followed by the shaman. They get to close to the acid pools and suddenly a six legged huge crocodile jumps out and grapples on of them into the acid pools. Surprisingly the druid manages to free himself and the shaman gets grappled instead...  The party started fighting and manages to kill the crocodile,  then they got jumped by a second crocodile and 3/4 characters are on death's door. The shaman died.


After this long explanation here's what my party (2/5 the rogue and the shaman whom left after his death) accuses me off. 

1) That I didn't give them enough signs that the place was dangerous. A door which reads ""danger"" in a mansion surrounded by blades and eternal darkness with creatures that you cannot kill and will snap your neck in a second with a 650 years old guardian that professes he is above the laws of the world (the spectator can communicate and watch over them because, he had 650 years to prepare himself for adventurers) weren't enough signs of danger... 


2) they didn't had any choice. In reality the mansion,  which they know how it's shaped, had two areas and they refused to search the first one trying to rush to the boss. The first area had many clues on what was inside the greenhouse and even a way to get up to the second floor where the boss is. They didn't wanted to explore it so why should I give them information they refused to search for? 

3) I should have balanced the encounter better. The monstrous crocodiles indeed did a lot of damage, mostly because they grappled the players into the acid. I knew that,  the players (were warned but say)  they didn't knew how dangerous they were. 

4) Accused me of targeting the mages on purpose instead of the barbarian. The druid and shaman rushed in front of him. I had the roll initiative when they entered the room. Those two had the highest score,  they went in first,  they got attacked. Literally I attacked the thing closest to the crocodile. 

5) I shouldn't have brought them there. Indeed, one could say I shouldn't have made such a dangerous place with such a hard encounter. I however placed a magical barrier around walls covered in blades to keep them out. Why didn't they ran away after the first or second near death encounter?  Let me be clear,  this whole area was optional. They saw a mansion on a Hill near the village they were staying into and decided to search it. The villagers knew nothing of that mansion and they were never capable of entering it. The players chose to continue,  what was I to do?  Tell them to get out? More that I did with the hints I dropped and the red flags I rised?  

I argued that they should have been more capable of discerning danger and should have left previously. I never made encounter that were so difficult before. They still pressed forward in an area obviously too dangerous. Even then, I couldn't have stopped the casters from moving forward into unknown danger first nor could I have stopped them from entering the room itself. 

In conclusion. What are your opinions on all of this?  Do you agree with them that I didn't gave enough info and I should have intervened?  Or do you agree with me that they should have realised how dangerous things were and be more careful? The shaman got so pissed he left because of this.

0,0,12,1,"I'm going to start GMing a campaign this Saturday. It's going to be bi-weekly sessions for between 1-4 hours and we'll be starting with the Beginner Box (which is mostly for my benefit) and then moving on in to Rise of The Rune Lords (Anniv. Edition).

It was going to be a full party of 4 consisting of a Druid with a warcat companion, a Warpriest, a Sorcerer, and a Wizard. Unfortunately, the druid has opted to back-out of the campaign due to outside issues so I'm now left with the other three. 

Generally speaking, would the three above come into many problems in the campaign usually brought about by a smaller party? I understand combat will tend to become more difficult and the lack of a skill monkey would pose a few challenges but being that they are casters, I was thinking that they should be able to handle it better than others. 

If need be, I will of course try to adjust encounter CRs accordingly but my initial plan is to just start them off one level higher which should at least ease my worries over the combat.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright. The first time I broached this subject, the time of reckoning was still distant and nebulous.

&amp;#x200B;

...Now, we're 19th level, Mythic Rank Four. And about halfway through this campaign. 

&amp;#x200B;

God help us.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my issue is, as it's always been with this game, that my character doesn't really have a clear-cut path.

&amp;#x200B;

The Magus, Samurai, and Rogue in our group will all likely end up taking levels in various archetypes of Fighter. The Samurai might go Kensai Magus, and there's wiggle room on the others, but, all three have builds that want Fighter Levels. The Monk's either going into Bloodrager or Barbarian.

&amp;#x200B;

...And, once again, there's me.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to Thalen's background, most of the casters don't make sense to take levels in; he specifically took up Alchemy because Wizardry couldn't heal the sick, and Clerics came with too many strings attached. Nevermind that the game itself has swayed his original course. 

&amp;#x200B;

Internal Alchemy has, in Pathfinder, strong Monastic leanings. However, a boon of the First World has left him Fey-shaped, leaving him a True Fey, serving as a sort of ambassador to the material plane, as well as the First World's resident Science Guy. (Because in a world where the laws of physics are relative, science is weird, and silly, and something the Fey would be interested in in a purely intellectual sense.)

&amp;#x200B;

Nevermind that the DM wants everyone in the party (me included) to have these soul-bound superartifact weapons. Which I'm at a loss on the creation of, in terms of both power and *form,* since Alchemists (especially Thalen) are more apt to blow you up than try to hit you with sticks. But, that's for another post.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, you have a bomb-slinging guru/doctor who distrusts the Gods, but might as well himself be a demigod (if i understand the lore of the First World right). No innate savant-like talents for the arcane, but studious enough for science, and now brimming with First World Powers.

&amp;#x200B;

...I mean, what? Druid? Ranger? Qinggong Monk? *Shifter*?

&amp;#x200B;

Where the hell do I even go with this, thematically?

&amp;#x200B;

  


...As a final thought? Yes. I \*could\* just keep leveling as an Alchemist. Or, grab the Master Chymist and Thuvian Alchemist PrCs. This increases the potency of my bombs, which is good. However, the advancing spell levels mean that I'd need to start learning ~~Metamagic~~ Metachemistry feats, or start using Spell Creation. Otherwise, those spell levels won't do much for me. Not to mention, the Thuvian Alchemist is just bad, and the Master Chymist has some pretty hard to swallow flavor. ...Also, I \*desperately\* need to reinforce my will save, and I can only stack magic items so far.",Pathfinder_RPG,"Epic Levels: Alchemist + ?

0,0,7,1,"I was looking over Occultist's Legacy Weapon, and it occurred to me that, in 90+% of situations, adding Bane to a weapon would be quite a bit better than simply adding the enhancement bonus it can grant. However, this got me thinking; should one, assuming an undisguised foe, have to roll some kind of check to discern which Bane enemy to put on their weapon for the situation?

Personally, it looks to me like the intent was simply the ability to ""designate certain foes,"" which wouldn't require a roll; you would simply say ""Bane of That Scary Guy Over There"" and apply whatever makes sense to the character at the time, but that's more than likely wishful thinking from me.

Let's take, for example, something like a Winter Wolf, that's *maybe* an animal, or *maybe* a magical beast... Would one require a check to know for certain that it is, indeed, a magical beast, or is forcing a check like that more like a houseruled nerf to the Legacy Weapon ability?",Pathfinder_RPG,Should a player have to roll Knowledge to discern the subtype of a creature for adding Bane on the fly?
0,0,5,19,"#[Neothelid Overlord](https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Neothelid%20Overlord)  
####Appearance  

Two disgusting heads rise above this enormous mass of slime-drenched coils and slithering tentacles.


####CR   20
#####Alignment:  CE
#####Size:   Gargantuan
####Special Abilities  

Aura of Madness (Su) Any sane being within 60 feet of a conscious neothelid overlord must succeed at a DC 33 Will saving throw each round or become confused for 1 round. A creature that fails 5 saves in a row becomes permanently insane, as per the insanity spell. A neothelid overlord can suppress or activate this aura as a free action. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Coordinated Attacks (Ex) A neothelid overlord can make attacks with the three tongues in each of its two heads. It can attempt to swallow two targets at the same time, but if the neothelid overlord instead attacks the same target with all six tongues, it gains a +4 bonus on all combat maneuver checks to grab and swallow that target, regardless of how many tongues successfully hit. On a round in which it uses its breath weapon, a neothelid overlord can still attack with the three tongues belonging to its other head.

Divided Consciousness (Ex) The neothelid overlord’s two heads share a split consciousness that allows it to operate as though the overlord were constantly under the effect of a divide mindOA spell.

Trace Teleport (Ex) A neothelid overlord telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination of all creatures that use a teleport spell or effect within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to “seen casually.” This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This ability does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Those who have learned secrets of the deepest vaults of Orv know of the neothelids of Denebrum. In fetid pools of poisonous swamps and surreal forests of twisted, phosphorescent fungi, these gigantic worm-things rule and wage war against Orv’s other denizens and each other. While most know that the neothelids are ancient creatures, spawned by eldritch beings in a time and place far removed from the known world, very few are aware that some neothelids are old beyond imagining. In their eons of existence, they have changed, surviving the centuries of mindless hunger that drives the youngest of their kind and ultimately defeating enough of their peers to become truly hideous masters of the damp, nearly lightless depths of Orv.

Scholars of such lore can only speculate as to what causes a neothelid to begin the transformation into an overlord. The change could be a natural process of age and development, though nothing about neothelids can truly be called natural. It may be that by delving into forbidden lore, they discover potent secrets, just as other rituals grant mortals the hideous power of lichdom. It might instead be that overlords’ ascendant power comes from some link to the blasphemous entities they venerate, a connection that only the most dedicated among the neothelids are able to cultivate. Whatever the cause, the result is terrifying—even maddening—to behold.

An overlord achieves such immense power and intellect that it reaches a state in which its consciousness splits into two minds that work as one. In a horrifying metamorphosis, the creature’s head splits down the middle to form two separate heads, each of which contains a portion of the neothelid’s intellect. The new neothelid overlord’s enhanced cognition grants it a deeper understanding of reality and enables it to harness psychic magic beyond the ken of its younger kin. Though still able to crush a victim with pure psychic force, the neothelid overlord develops an awesome level of finesse and skill in the manipulation of both mind and matter.

Neothelid overlords undergo other physical changes as well. Although they do not become significantly larger than typical neothelids, overlords take on a darker hue and their bodies sprout myriad tentacles that constantly squirm, as though each possessed a sentience of its own. The creatures’ tails also split into three parts, the ends of which claw and dig at the ground as though trying to take root in the very bedrock. The functions of overlords’ tentacles and triple tails are a mystery. It is possible that they have something to do with reproduction or the spawning of their seugathi (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 243) servants, but the truth is something that only the most insane researchers could hope to uncover. Along with these physical changes comes an increase in might and a swiftness that one would not expect from something so large. A typical neothelid overlord measures approximately 100 feet in length from head to tail, though it usually remains coiled and takes up about one-fifth of that space. Overlords weigh about 100,000 pounds, though individuals can vary wildly in size.

Neothelid overlords rise to become tyrannical rulers, directing less developed members of their race toward goals that no healthy mind can fathom. They reinforce their power over subordinates through manipulation and punitive displays of power, believing that fear of random-appearing punishments keeps their followers in line even when they are not under observation. Most assume that neothelid overlords serve either their own whims or those of the ones they worship—the shapeless and terrible entities of the Dark Tapestry that created neothelids and countless other horrors in the darkest reaches of space and time. Few who know of these monsters, though, dare to think that their purposes are anything but anathema to normal life whether aboveground or belowground.

In The Dream Diary of Lady Elliara Celmenari, written in 3875 ar, the Taldan author claims to have visited Denebrum while in an astral form and to have seen at least one neothelid overlord. Her writings depicts the creature as guarding the resting place of two dormant bholes (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 18). The text describes the overlord sending out madness-inducing offspring into the world to find a means of awakening and controlling the legendary beasts. Most learned folk attribute Lady Celmenari’s dreams of doom and destruction to a chronic nervous condition, compounded by the impending collapse of Taldan supremacy. But in recent years, rumors have come to light indicating that a certain cult of Groetus is working with agents of a mysterious and unwholesome nature toward a similar goal, which has dangerous implications for all of Golarion. To occult scholars, visions and whispers such as these serve as further evidence that terrible things wait in the dark places of the multiverse and must be opposed.

0,0,8,4,"&gt;!I have a question for DMs out there who have ran or are running Rise of the Runelords. Before I ask, just want to give you a little background. The only AP I've ran is Jade Regent and I am currently a player who just got done with the giant/ogre cave in book 3, I believe. We have 6 PCs in our group and up until the cave with the stone giants and hags we tended to cake walk through encounters, with the exception of one particularly nasty crit with an ogre hook at Fort Rannick.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!One of my friends opted to DM this campaign for our group and I happily agreed, but I am concerned that he is buffing the hell out of the encounters in an effort to kill us or maybe some misguided attempt to challenge us more. When we entered the cave we ended up drawing out every creature in the cave at once, including a trio of hags (who I later learned from my Magic Jar spell had 138hp each and several magic wands with spells like see invisibility, invisibility, scorching ray, and fireball spread out among them), a pair of stone giants, and a few hill giants. We had to make a second attempt on the cave and when we came back all of the monsters were invisible to us due to the wands the hags had. Our ranger is a beast at killing giants and did over 100hp worth of damage before killing the stone giant guard, which seems excessive from my memory of monster stats in Jade Regent at this level. Oh and I forgot that the undead ranger commander was shooting us several times a round for decent arrow damage and took over 100hp worth of damage himself before he finally fell.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Not I am not sure what is actually written in the AP, but I have a gut feeling that these monsters should not have been this tough. It took me possessing a hill giant via Magic Jar and collapsing the cave ceiling just to get us all out alive and away from them all, and we only managed to kill one hag and a couple giants.!&lt;

Did my friend buff these up to ridiculous levels or am I just imagining things?

0,0,5,3,"So, we began at level 0 during the Market Festival. PCs gained their attributes by their actions (started at 10) during certain encounters (Ex: saving a girl from a Molthuni merchant, saving a kid choking on candied apples, tripping on mushrooms and not killing their hallucinations which were actually kids playing Goblins &amp; Heroes, winning at various carnival games etc)


After they got their attributes to lv 1 status they left the tent city and entered Phaendar proper. Here they went around to the shrine , trading company, oreld's shop, and the inn. At the shrine the group encountered a group from Last Wall on a pilgrimage to Phaendar to visit the holy site where Cayden drunkenly arm wrestled Torag. At the trading company the group saw 7 dwarves one of them was referred to as The Guildmaster. The Guildmaster gave Blondebeard a onyx shard and told her that tonight is the night and the next time they met it would be in Droskar's forge (I'll talk more about this later). At Oreld's shop they see Navah trying to convince Oreld to go back adventuring to Fangwood Keep. Then in the inn they come across a member of the Foxclaw scouts (one of the PCs is part of the Foxclaws).


So, as you can see I may have veered pretty far from the main plot. I changed the troglodyte caves to Droskar's Crucible and am using kobolds for that. The Guild serves as a union for craftsman in this region. In the Kobold King it mentions a theocratic empire devoted to Droskar. I thought the last vestiges of that empire are Kraggodan (although they are no longer worshipers of Droskar) and the Guild (which basically has the Crystalspire completely under its thumb). 


The Guild has an even bigger sphere of influence in the Darklands where they came into contact with Zanathura. Zanathura had built up a slew of morlock and kobold followers. The naga witch was absolutely enthralled with everything dwarf. So, the guild master told her about the Onyx Key and how to get it. Everything else is pretty much in line with the AP as far as this part is concerned. Zanathura gifted her kobold tribe to Ibzairiak to ensure the dragon would happily follow the general. I feel like these kobolds should be enemies of the kobold tribe the PCs encounter in Droskar's Crucible in a hope that my PCs will befriend this group and work with them.


I also mentioned Navah talking to Oreld. In my version Navah, Mayor Crawbert, Glintaxe, Oreld, and as of right now nameless elf rogue were all apart of the same adventuring group. As I understand it Navah researches transmutation on living creatures in an attempt to stay youthful. In her research she thinks something lies under Fangwood Keep and would like Oreld's help checking it out as the forces of Nirmathi just recently recaptured the fort. It's barely even an adventure, but Oreld refuses as he is happy in his small town.


Now what's in Fangwood Keep? By the time the adventurers can get to it (if they even do) it has been overtaken by the legion. So, Tessarael was a transmuter. Her arcane engine portal'd her away, but now the arcane engine serves as a prison for Argwyn. Which if they free Fangwood keep Argwyn will eventually become free as well while they are off trying to save Nirmathas. 


By the time the PC's stop Azaersi they will look up and find that Kraggodan, southern Nirmathas, and a vast majority of Molthune in their weakened state have come under the ""protection"" of the Guild (I'm thinking Trade Federation style from Star Wars). The Guild has now basically reforged Droskar's old empire. And they also have Argwyn and her rose blight taking over Chernasardo and challenging the Accressial Court.

0,0,28,6,"Hey there! I am new to Pathfinder, very soon starting my first game with my group, consisting of fellow Pathfinder newbies. As such, I still have a bit of a hard time finding a good build, something that is at least useful. As such, apologies if I'm going to ask some dumb questions here.  

So, for my first character, I want to play an Inquisitor, whom I first created with the help of several guides. He'd have a high Wisdom stat, as well as being of the Conversion Inquisition, so that he can be used as the face of the party. In general, I really like how versatile the class can be. The one thing I was not happy with, however, was my inquisitor's selection of melee weapons, since he is also supposed to be able to hold his own in combat. I did some research and found out that apparently, the Scimitar is a very good weapon, so I would like to use that.

While I know that an Inquisitor of Sarenrae would get proficiency with Scimitar's by default, this is unfortunately not an option for me. After years of playing a good-aligned group in another system, my group is eager to play an evil-aligned group for our first venture into Pathfinder, so my character is a Lawful Evil Devil-Spawn Inquisitor of Asmodeus. This leaves him with the Mace as his deities favoured weapon, which is apparently considered to be the opposite of a good weapon.

So, my current idea for a Scimitar-wielding Inquisitor of Asmodeus would be to give him the Heirloom Weapon trait, which grants him proficiency with the heirloom (Scimitar in this case). I also stumbled upon the Dervish Dance feat and I realized, this would mean I could make a Dex-based build, somewhat lessening the need to have high values in so many different attributes, as the only true dump stat I have right now is Charisma. For this, my idea was to have him start the game at Level 1 with the Heirloom Weapon trait for the Scimitar proficiency and the Weapon Finesse feat as a prerequisite, then to invest 2 points into Perform (Dance) at Level 2, so that I can pick Dervish Dance at Level 3. My idea would be to ignore Strength, since I'd use Dexterity for the Scimitar, leaving it somewhere around 10-12 points, while putting the then-free points into Dexterity.

For the record, the group wishes to play with the Epic Fantasy point buy, so my idea for starting attributes would be: Str 12/Dex 16/Con 13 (15 thanks to racial)/Int 12/ Wis 16 (18 thanks to racial)/Cha 8 (6 thanks to racial). 
Since I have never before created a character, I am naturally a bit hesitant, as I fear that my idea would ultimately result in a sub-par, poorly optimized character. I don't need a properly min/maxed character, but would still like to be somewhat useful. So, for this I have three questions:

1) Is the idea worth pursuing? Would it result in a character who can be decently useful in combat (of course not to the same degree as a Fighter or Barbarian), or is a Dex-based Dervish Dance Inquisitor a bad idea?

2) In such a Dex-based build, is Strength an outright dump stat on the same level as Charisma, or is it still something I should not ignore entirely, such as Intelligence? What use would I have for Strength in this build?

3) In case this is a decent concept, is the abovementioned attribute distribution fine that way, or is there anything I should change about it?

I hope you can help me out here and thank you in advance!",Pathfinder_RPG,Need help with a possible Dex-based Inquisitor build

 Hi all

Currently the idea is for the quest is quite simple:

Players enter forest looking for elven tribe to try and recruit the Alchemist to return with them to the city (City currently has no alchemist).  Player enters the forest find very wild elves that have been Shaped by the diseased land (Elves change if they stay in a certain environment for long), I'm still not sure how I want them changed. The Elves will be living in the trees in where they have built a relatively small village but very impressive and beautiful. Anyhow Alchemist is one of the three elders of tribe ( or clan elves will probably be in clans?) , the elders refuse a to give a meeting to the players until they have proven their worth by  slaying a local Ettercap and his pet spider. \*Combat encounter\*  then meet elders and negotiation a deal with the Clan/tribe where the one Elder returns to city to become a Alchemist But the even clan/tribe become part of the princes domain.

I've been reading up on them and their origins a lot over the past week, with Path of the Hellknight and bits and bobs I can find on wikis, but while I can understand their ideals and motivations to an extent, as well as their general attitudes and dispositions, when it comes to actually verbalizing it all I feel like I'm coming short. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very much the kind of person who needs to have knowledge to pull from myself, and I feel like I need something like an actual copy of the Measure and the Chain, or some semblance of one, in order to be able to portray them properly. So, with that in mind I'm probably going to end up writing up a very barebones version of it, the point being to have concrete definitions of the Law that I (and therefore my Hellknights) actually pull from in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done some searching online, and have been unable to locate anything of that nature myself, which is surprising to me, because Hellknights are badass and the Measure should totally be something every Hellknight has defined in their mind, to an extent.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, my query to you all is a bit specific at first, before opening up a bit: 

**General Questions**

Fort Inevitable is a Hellknight dominated and controlled town. I don't know too much about Cheliax, so I don't have any example to draw from making me ask, but would it make sense that the Hellknights stop and search all travelers into the town looking for illegal goods and contraband? In the book, it is stated that they question everyone entering and leaving the town, so I'm just wondering why they don't just go all out and pat down everyone like our airports.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, I think I've seen around that most Hellknights have the ability to read thoughts or discern lies; do they do this consistently to any citizens that might be recognized as suspicious, or save their abilities for something truly necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, what would the Hellknights stance on poison be? I had PCs enter the Fort last week with poison, and as I didn't quite have the time prior to session 1 to research all this, they were not searched, but they then asked me if poison is illegal out of character, and I just didn't know what to say, because in the book there's this: 

&gt;Sefurd is an unpleasant character with an oily, wheedling manner and an unhealthy interest in exotic toxins. He deals in potions, spell components, alchemical mixtures, and, of course, a wide array of poisons. Master Sefurd is disliked by most who know him, and his trade is regarded as suspicious by the Hellknights. Many people wonder why the lady commander hasn’t shut down his business and run him out of town. The answer is simple: Master Sefurd is Lady Commander Drovust’s informant on the Council of Prosperity.

&amp;#x200B;

This guy is allowed to openly sell poison to citizens because the Lady Commander is using him. Does this mean anyones allowed to just *have* poison? Or is it one of those things that's a trap, and if you buy it and are seen with it you're getting executed.

&amp;#x200B;

Which segues into the next question: What severity of a crime ends in an individuals execution, or forced slavery? I know Hellknights are Merciless, but I'm confused on just how how ""low"" of a crime will end in those things. 

Example 1: Stealing bread from a vendor. Execution, slavery, or a hand? Or?

Example 2: Making unauthorized additions to your floor plan. Execution, slavery, or? 

&amp;#x200B;

Based off everything I've read, it seems the hand is the least likely to happen, but I really do gotta wonder just how often they execute people. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Measure and How you Run Hellknights**

If you've made it this far, I imagine you know a thing or two about Hellknights, so even if you can't answer all the questions, I'd greatly appreciate some insight into how others portray Hellknights.

&amp;#x200B;

Are they very codexical in the way they summarize warnings and threats? 

Example 1: ""According to Article 564 subsection 54c of the Measure, making subterranean modifications to one's estate within city walls without consulting city planners is unlawful and punishable by \[death, slavery, lashings, etc\]. A trial will be held in accordance to Article 45 Section 1. You are to submit to arrest and come quietly with no resistance to be held in prison until the time of the trial, Article 3 Section 2a.""

Or do they just simply make statements on certain things?

Example 2: ""It is illegal to modify ones estates without first consulting a city planner. You are being put to trial for your crimes. Come quietly and do not resist, and perhaps your life will be spared.""

&amp;#x200B;

How do you imagine the Measure to be? What would you see in it?

I have found myself joining a small group for a play through of Rise and I want to ask you all out there in internet land what ideas you have for classes.

So far we have a Summoner who is going to make their pet more of a skill monkey, and a Druid with a plant pet and some nature healing, basically goodberries.

My thought so far is that some more heals and melee would be a good addition to the party. I've been looking at Warpriest as he can do both of those things relatively well, a Divine Hunter Hunter, buffed pet for tanking and some cleric spells ain't bad, or an Infusion Alchemist to give the party some pots and wish them luck as I hurl bombs, or possibly mutate and charge into melee.

A charismatic necromancer that becomes the leader of a town after he convinces everyone to give his body after they die to help the people. So everyone gets paid in their life and they return the favour after they died letting the necromancer use his bones and flesh to keep building and repairing the city, defending it against beasts, cultivating the land, usign them for minery and jobs where a living person would be in danger, etc  
So every generation would be getting paid for making the next generation live better.

Im beginning to plan around this idea and how i can use it for plot and sidequests (a secret part of his necromancers planing to take over the town, some undead escapes control and begin to wander the roads, pharasma and sarenrae followers trying to destroy the city, etc).  
Of course the leader is going to need help from more necromancers to handle all the work (im thinking in a large town, so the poblation is around the 4000. The undead force of work would be between 500 and 750 zombies)

 The leader necromancer hast the best intentions. He doesnt want to control the world, he just wants that his town prosper and that people live happily under his reign.  
To live forever, he has a druid friend (a Reincarnated Druid, member of the party he were) that makes him reincarnate always and he has the inmortality discovery (per RAW that discovery just says that you dont get penalties for aging, but it doesnt say that you avoid dying from aging). 

 The undead have the order of not attacking the living. Of course there are safety procedures and security around them in case something goes wrong.  
The living usually dont do any work made by the undead (mining, farming, building) All that kind of work goes to the undead because they dont get tired).

0,0,2,7,"So, I was curious exactly how Investigator’s Inspiration mechanic compares to regular bonuses. More specifically, I wanted to figure out the answer to the following question:

Given equal amount of Inspiration and a generic skill bonus granting resource (BGR), how large would the bonus have to be for the BGR to be more preferable than Inspiration.

To find that out, I devised the following experiment. I am using the Monte Carlo method to compare two functions:

\- First function simulates a series of skill checks by a character with access to Inspiration. Inspiration is only spent if there is more than 50% chance it will make a failed check succeed. The character does not have access to either amazing inspiration nor tenacious inspiration Investigator talents.

\- The second function simulates a series of skill checks by a character with access to a limited resource that provides them with a bonus to the roll. As there is no way to determine wheter the resource will be needed, it is always used when it is available.

Below are the results of the experiment. Each column coresponds to the DC that has to be beaten in order to pass the check (from 2 to 20). Each row coresponds to the amount of Inspiration/BGR at character’s disposal. Each cell shows the bonus at which BGR started giving better results than Inspiration (EDIT - if the value is 0, Inspiration always gave better results). The total number of skill checks each time was 100 000.

You may notice some artifacts, like the 19 in the „8000 Inspiration” row. These are most likely a result of either errors in code that I failed to find, or imperfections in the pseudorandom number generator.

The biggest conclusion here is that the size of the bonus at which BGR becomes worthwhile depends primarely on the amount of the resource you have available when compared to the number of checks that are important enough to consider using BGR in the first place. The DC does not affect the size of the bonus – instead, it influences wheter the BGR will surpass the Inspiration at all.

Generally speaking, based on those results, I think it is safe to say that Inspiration will be superior to BGR under all „naturally occuring” circumstances. Bonuses below +10 only become worthwile when you have enough BGR to cover 28% of all checks where you might consider using it. Of the top of my head, the only ability granting +10 to a skill check that I can think of is Natural Divination (though I’m sure there are others), which starts at a single use per day and tops of at six. So, nowhere near sufficient. More reasonable bonuses, like +5 and +4 only start being worthwile if you can cover more than half of the skill checks, which isn’t going to happen either – if you have access to this sort of abilities in the first place you are likely playing some sort of a skill monkey.

I have to say, these results surprised me. I expected Inspiration to be better overall, but I didn’t expect it to be this dominant. What do you guys think of these results? And do you see any major flaws in the experiment?

Onto the questions:

 So, I'm making a monster for my character's backstory, and the antagonist of the backstory (the monster) is supposed to be a 'dark Unicorn' with twelve levels in Gunslinger. So I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question #1:** Unicorns are immune to poison, right? So does that mean they can't become Vamps?

**Question #2:** Can Unicorns be evil? And if so does that mean they lose their protection against evil and change it to a protection against good? If so, does that allow them to become a Vampire?

**Question #3:** Does a Unicorn's horn stop working if the Unicorn becomes evil (if that's even possible)?

Story time: So I am the GM for my group and at our last session (which picked up from a pretty bad situation), my party (after a bad fight and a dubious call on my part that the party didn’t like but I stick by)got captured. They, by all right, should have been killed by these troops (as they brutally executed their surrendering leader in front of them) but I decided to be merciful.

It’s been a pretty long term game and I don’t want to simply kill one of the characters unceremoniously but am willing to do that if the situation warrants it. I cannot think of a way they can get freed (most of their friends are dead or gone) and the only element to consider is they’ve 2 players that weren’t there, and they technically didn’t get captured with the others. I don’t want to cheapen the experience by just throwing them an obvious way out but I don’t want to have a (mostly) party wipe either. However, the situation does really seem difficult to escape without some casualties, they are surrounded by enemies and despite having worked and talked with each other and their enemies for a few hours of real time, they couldn’t find a way out.

0,0,170,42,"i had this idea for a paladin who believes that there's no way to do enough good in the world in one lifetime, so they become a lich in order to give themself more time and ability to help people, hunt demons, spread their deity's message, etc.

I think this seems like a perfectly reasonable thing for a particularly dedicated paladin to do; sure, they don't get to go hang out with their deity when they die, but isn't that what paladins are supposed to be all about, sacrificing themselves for the sake of others? and yes, becoming a lich is necromancy, which is generally considered evil, but that's because necromancy is usually done with other people's bodies/souls without their consent. I don't see how willingly practicing necromancy on yourself should necessarily be evil.

obviously, if I wanted to, I could just throw a lich template on a character, switch out evil for LG, and switch negative energy effects to positive energy, but is there any way, by RaW, to have a character like this, PC or NPC?

edit: a lot of people are saying that the process of becoming a lich inherently involves committing evil acts such as human sacrifice, but the [lich template](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/lich/), which ostensibly outlines the process, doesn't say anything about those kinds of acts being a necessity. it just says that you have to create a phylactery, which is a long and costly procedure, but not necessarily an inherently evil one (unless there's some other source detailing the process that I'm missing).

edit 2: there was some other source detailing the process that I was missing, the eternal apotheosis ritual. however, the description of the ritual says:

&gt;This ritual represents just one way some liches have transferred their souls into phylacteries. Other rituals tied to lichdom involve bargains or liaisons with evil outsiders, caster-created alchemical tinctures infused with the energy of loved ones’ souls, and other such trying necessities.

this explicitly says that eternal apotheosis is not the only way to become a lich, and while the other examples listed are also evil, nothing actually says that there's no non-evil way to do so. and I don't see how existing without a soul should be inherently evil either; does that mean all inanimate objects are secretly evil?",Pathfinder_RPG,why do liches have to be evil?

0,0,6,2,"1E. I'm on mobile so apologies for bad formatting.

I'm running a campaign in which one player's abandoned character is now a major villain under the BBEG. I had bern setting up a character storyline for him as he was amnesiac, but he decided he wanted to play a different character before it was concluded- so I took the ""evil choice"" ending for the character, had him betray the party after he had gone missing for a couple months of sessions, and revealed he was a former captain of the BBEG, now back in his position. The party will be running into him several times before the final showdown as they foil/fail to foil his machinations so I need to start figuring out how his encounters will work early.

At the time of his separation from the party, he was a 5th-level Inquisitor who used a boar spear as his main weapon. I don't remember his domain but that can shift now that he has turned. He is also a skeleton who disguises himself as a human, although the party and their important allies are aware of this. He also used evil-aligned divine spells secretly while in the party, notably Inflict Wounds. At the time this was so he could heal himself (as being undead meant standard healing would damage him) but his NPC form will br willing to use it more freely. He's also an asshole and makes liberal use of bone puns.

Lorewise, he's called the Voice of the Emperor, and he uses his authority under the Empire to make deals, blackmail people, and intimidate or influence people into doing what he wants. Abilities or feats that fit that theme would be great.

My problem is using the character base to make an actually challenging encounter without making it cheap difficulty. I'd also rathet not have to rely on adds/minions if possible.

The party is currently level 9 but will likely be 12-14 by the time they fight the guy for real. Even at level 9 I'm having trouble with creating good encounters because the players range from ""min-maxed into absurdity"" to ""I don't really know what I am doing."" Party is:

- Suli Invulnerable Rager Barbarian. Has stupid amounts of DR, elemetal DR, and health, and still hits hard. He's the min-maxer and is the primary cause if GM headaches as anything that actually hurts him does crazy damage to any other party member.
- Elf Fighter. Obsessed with tripping everything. Uses a Greatsword, has Spirit Weapon feat that lets him apply enchantments to his weapon every day.
- Strix Fighter 8/Sorcerer 1. Is training out of Sorc since the casters joined. Death From Above + Catfall boots. Previously skelly's player.
- Kitsune Ninja. Either does no damage or ridiculous damage. Squishy but can use Vanishing Trick.
- Catfolk Time Oracle. Has the Oracle feet that lets het move 10xlevel feet per day without triggering AoOs. Mostly healslaves.
- Elf Wizard. New player, terrified of dying so loaded up with defensive spells. Just realized they need more offense. Also may have become addicted to Enervate.

I'm worried about a few things:
1. Damage will do too much to everyone except the Barb who will take no damage.
2. So many PCs means NPC gets overwhelmed.
3. If NPC gets tripped it's practically over, but making him immune feels cheap.
4. Enervate. Just... I don't need to say anything more, do I?

So do you guys have any ideas for ways I can make him a threat without making players feel like they are tied? I.E. an antimagic field would prevent Enervate spam but would also make both the Oracle and the Wizard useless.

I'd prefer to use Inquisitor feats/traits/abilities if possible, but multiclassing also works. Magic/Wondrous items are also an option. I'm also open to Legendary Actions (I think they are called?) to counter the PC count. I'm already planning on greatly buffing his HP to make sure he lasts more than one round.

0,0,30,2,"So, this is somehow related to my last thread but it is a different topic that I'm genuinely curious to expand. I don't want to criticize anyone, I just want to understand and broaden my horizons.

So I've made several strong build myself too and I soon realized that min/maxing wasn't my thing. The feeling of dirt under my skin after playing the Knight with the pouncing dinosaur or the the barbarian with the max damage vital strike is something that I will never be able to wash off my skin. The worst part is that of those campaigns I remember nothing except some wacky anedocte. P.S. I know that martial builds can't even be properly addressed as OP.

Now, if I can see the beauty of theorycrafting strong builds, my experience has led me to not understand the need to bring those to the table. Instead I usually go the hypster way trying to make waky things work.

So that's the first question: when you do that, what leads you to bring overpowered stuff to the table?

The second question ties a bit with one of the possible answer of the first. Supposing that one reason to play an op build is to see how far you can push, to test the boundaries...

How do you want to be checked? Do you want to be stat-checked? By that I mean the scenario of facing stronger and stronger monsters ranking high in the CR department till the GM finds the numbers you can't beat.

Do you want to be outsmarted? ""I'm really curious to see what the GM will throw at me to test this build without simply recurring to high CR monsters"". That's another legit take: I can see players that would feel cheated if, simply because they are playing a strong character, they face only stronger monsters so that they don't feel strong at all because the GM is too lazy to think alternatives.

Are you fine with being unable to fight full strength all the time? That's another scenario, often used in many types of narrative. The hero has its power somehow limited and the big climax arrive when finally he can fight full strenght again smashing through that puny insects.

If you have min/maxed a specific mechanic are you fine with key enemies (or even many enemies) to be completely immune to it if there is legit reasons for it? Let's say you have made the fabled grapple build with the 2 turns coup de grace, with the giant druid archetype thingy. How would you react to the sudden spread of Freedom of Movement? 

My doubt is that obviously no player can win the arm wrestle with the GM right? But obviously that's not the point of the game. However when a particularly strong build presents to the table it begins a struggle of boundary checks to present the adequate challenge and it can go south quite fast.

So, when you bring the over powered build to the table what do you expect from your GM?
Of course this question rise from troubles at my table and you are probably not the the people I should ask this things to, however I'm really curious to scout how people approaches this aspect of the game.",Pathfinder_RPG,Help me understand power-playerism

Pathfinder Reddit 2019

**Intro:** As recent discussion showed, that many GMs and players have issues with playing or allowing summons and summon-oriented characters. I try to collect all the different issues and offer some guides, ideas and solutions for them.  

**Assumption:** 

You are not an asshole and you don´t play with assholes. You play together to have fun and you all feel responsible for the fun of all other members in the group. Otherwise your problems start there, not with a particular class selection.  

There are two main prejudices, and unfortunately there is some truth to them. 

- *""Summons are too powerful""*
- *""Summons take too long to solve""* 

I would like to modify these two statements to what I believe reflects the truth a bit better: 

- **""They are too powerful for inexperienced GMs""**
- **""They take too long if you are not properly prepared""**

Fortunately both issues can be tackled. Let´s get to work.

**TOO SLOW!** 

A SM5 Dire Tiger can pounce, with that he has 5 attacks, each attack must be rolled, then each damage roll must be rolled, and then you need to check for the corresponding grab attack. Oh, you are level 13 and you have summoned 4 Dire Tigers, evolved them with an additional sting attack and hasted them? *That´s now 28 attacks?* That´s an awful lot. A SM7 Movanic Angel can provide you with Holy Aura, Aura of Protection, Detect Evil, Dispel Evil, Dispel Magic, Self-Invisibility, Cure Serious Wounds ... holy sh%t, whats the range of the Darkvision and what does the Vital Strike Feat do. I need the Bestiary 1-4 and the core book and then I need to look up X and Y and Z and ... *why exactly are you studying the pizza menu?* 

- **Use your Smartphone for Dice Apps** like *CritDice*. 

- **Use the fantastic** [**Master Summoner App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrazors.mastersummoner). An example of a large mass combat is [described here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/apemnp/new_app_from_the_creater_of_pathbuilder_master/egsuden/). I can only recommend it, especially the *""Roll all attacks / damage for all summons""* option. The above mentioned 28 attacks? A matter of seconds. Literally! It really is *that good* and the small token of appreciation is well invested, both for the developer and the group. It´s from the same guy who made Pathbuilder btw.

- **Average the damage dices!** It takes away some player agency and in average it makes Damage Resistance of enemies a bit stronger, but it speed things up considerably. *3 attacks hit? Great, that´s 3x 8 damage for a total of 24 damage*. 

- **Tell the players the Armor Class!** Many players can assume the AC of an enemy, from experience, knowledge or after the first 3 attacks, so it´s not exactly a state secret. While the others take their round, the summoner rolls his dices, and simply announces ""2 hits, 28 damage"" - end of round. 

- **Adjust what you summon!** Some players are new, inexperienced or simply overwhelmed by the complexity of the summoning class. Make sure that your player understands that many new mechanics are introduced with a SM spell. If he feels overwhelmed, simply ask him to reduce his summoning power to 1 or 2 different summons each level until he feels more comfortable with the more complex mechanics. 

- **Prepare your summons!**: write down the stats, look up what the special attacks, spells or abilities do, prepare the attack routine etc. *There is absolutely no excuse not to prepare your summons.*

- **Use color coded dices** to roll multiple attacks (and damage values) at the same time).

- **Concentrate only on a few types of summons!** Having 5 Dire Tigers is faster than having 2 Dire Tigers, one Tyrannosaurus, 1 Deva and 2 Mephits. 

- **Limit the summons!** If you are, for whatever reasons, not able to efficiently cope with multiple summons (which can happen for many good reasons: perhaps you are completely new to the system, before you prefer a far more ""rules light"" approach etc), do not hesitate to check with the player or the GM if limiting the amount of summons would be an idea. For example: a maximum of 1 offensive creature (because there will be the combat dice rolls), and 1 defensive creature (for Auras, Healing, Buffing., like the Shedu for example), which does not attack and stays in the background. 





**TOO POWERFUL!** *And then he summoned dozens of angels and demons, and they bombed everything away and he had like 20 different spells active at the same time and ... I do not know what to do"".*  You will find these kind of stories all over the net. IMHO the root of the issue is that many GMs feel a bit overwhelmed by the possibilities of what summons can do and the issues with preparing for them. And a single spell which can provide damage, healing, utility, travel, support or other surprises between each casting can be scary. But this is nothing a group cannot overcome.

- **Support your group!** While it may be tempting as a player to nuke the encounter and ignore the party, another approach can provide a better solution: use your summons to close gaps in your party setup! You have super-strong melees but you are lacking int the healing department? Some of your summons can reduce incoming damage by 50% and provides 18d6 of healing. There is no shame in supporting other players and characters and boost them directly (flanking) or indirectly (support abilities). Actually it can feel very rewarding. Try it out.

- **Enemies are allowed to run away!** Enemies do not have to act stupid when it comes to magic.  Magic is usually a long existing part of the world; and you as a GM can define that it is commonly know that magic (and with that summons) is a limited resource. Even your group of common highway bandits can act on that. *Retreat, delay, hide, attack later*. 

- **Protection from X level 1 spell!** Many summons, including animals summoned with the celestial/findish template, have an alignment different from True Neutral. A simply ""Protection from X"" can stop several different summons. **""This causes the *natural weapon* attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.""**. Sure, many summons later have weapons and some are True Neutral. But your Celestial Dire Tiger will be stopped - hard.

- **Terrain!** Speaking of the dreaded Pouncing Dire Tiger: a pounce is a charge and a charge cannot happen on difficult terrain. Nothing is stopping you as GM to sometimes define the terrain as non-ideal for combat. Perhaps it is in a heavily overgrown forest. Perhaps during a snow storm on a difficult mountain path. Perhaps it is the stately manor full of expensive art... [edit: someone told me that an FAQ allows long jumping (with an Acrobatics check] as part of the charge movement]

- **The case of the SWAT catsl** Summoned Animals are exactly that: animals. Even when they can use basic tactics as alpha predators, they are not exactly SWAT trained. Yes, they will happily attack the enemies the of the summoner. But perhaps not in the most ideal way. They can set of traps, eat attack of opportunities, go for the most obvious or nearest threat or use / not use special abilities at this most perfect moment. 

- **Avoid the 15 minute adventure day!** If your group knows that there will only be one battle or one critical situation to solve and the rest will be fun &amp; easy, every character with limited resources will be tempted to use all and everything in that critical moment, hence the dreaded 15 min nuke incident. Sometimes it can really feel good for the group to be super-powerful and to rofl-stomp over an enemy. Sometimes this is pure fun and that is perfectly fine. But only sometimes. Don´t fall into that trap and make it a habit with your players. Surprise them! Trap them! Expand their adventure day into the night! Give them the reason to delay their rest because X just happened and Y must be prevented in Z time! With that, the players and their characters will, over time, be more careful with their resources. They will *conserve magic powers* and not blow everything away for one battle. Which makes the actual battle easier for you as a GM to manage.

- **Variety is the spice of life!** Don´t fall into the habit of providing an endless stream of similar encounters in similar environments with similar conditions. If you always have a fight against some orcs in an open area, then yes, a Pouncing Dire Tiger is very strong. This does not have to be the case and you as a GM can provide many different locations, circumstances, (win)conditions and enemies.

- **Know the damn rules!** No really! Check them! The amount of *""Yeah, and then his summon teleported us away""* or *""Simply summon the Lantern Archon and have him cast Continual Light for some easy money""* or *""Yeah, summon the Djinn for 9 rounds, his Windwalk will be there for hours""* is too damn high. Sit together with your player, check out the summons he got for the new level, ask him if there are any special abilities who could be interesting and check the rules. The Djinns ability to *Create Wine* may be not that interesting, the Shedus ability to cast *Shield Other* may be very interesting (but for the latter you need platinum rings for the party members ...). 

- **Attack everyone in the party!** Magic exists! Magic is powerful! Magic is dangerous! Every intelligent and self-preserving enemy, from the lowest highway bandit to the demon-negotiating overlord knows that. They may attempt to derail the magic stuff happening. That can be something as easy as some hidden archers or cheap alchemist items. That can be a teleporting Babau Demon or a raging barbarian. Do not let the summoner (or casters in general) be perfectly safe by standing in the second row. Make your enemies action in line with their abilities, knowledge, resources, beliefs etc. **But never make them extra stupid**. 

- **Mass Effect!** Don´t fall for the trap to increase the power of the villain or the enemies beyond a reasonable amount *because there is a summoner boohoo*. The balance in PF does not work that way. Instead think about adding some lower level enemies. Reinforcements, snipers in ambush, a teleporting devil, a flying chimera etc. Due to the nature of the action economy this will provide a far better result in making the combat interesting and challenging.

- **The CR gap!** Usually the summons a player can call are of a lower CR than the party. With level 9 and SM5 you can summon a Babau Demon CR6. With level 17 and SM9 you can sumon an Astral Deva CR14. That usually means lower hit dices, AC, saves, spell / ability DCs etc. While the list may seem very impressive at first, the actual dice rolls may be far less impressive, especially on higher levels, when Spell Reistance play a more important role. *The Leonal Agathion can cast 10d6 Fireballs at will! But ... at Reflex DC 15. On Level 15 or 17. Which means that almost every enemy at that level will make the save and then often has fire resistance/immunity - combined with high hitpoints and spell resistance.*

- **Specific anti-summon spells!** There exist a number of specialized anti-summon / anti-magic spells out there, like *Anti-Magic-Field*, *Dispel Magic* (really!) or *Bite The Hand*. **Sometimes** a specialized Nemesis of the group may be absolutely appropriate.

- **Strength and weaknesses!** Monsters are powerful, but many of them have weaknesses. The Small Earth Elemental is very powerful for Level 3 to 5. But it has a speed of only 20 feet. The Dire Lion is very powerful when it can pounce ... but actually quite weak against Damage Resistance. The Hound Archon is a great allrounder for level 7. But a Reflex +5 save is actually not that great against spells which target reflexes. Check out the summons, their strength and weaknesses. 

- **Inbuilt optimization!** Many classes has incredible amounts of spells, feats, archetypes etc available. A player with high system mastery can make absurd builds with that. Or rather very average or even weak builds. But for a summoner? Even the most basic summon list contains usually 2-3 very strong choices for every spell level. And their feats are quite easy to find and are actually quite obvious. Augmented Summoning? Summon Good Monster? Versatile Summoning? Evolved Summons? You do not really need to be a master of optimization to recognize the power of feats, summon-oriented spells and monsters after reading through the list the first time. That means, as a GM, do not be afraid to ask your players to not overwhelm the other players when they choose mechanically weaker options. It is a general advice and in a group with mechanically vastly different power levels there will never be an ideal solution. 

- **The case of the the MAD &amp; SAD character** One large advantge of primary spellcasters is that they need *only one attribute to be excellent* in their role - everything is a bonus. Many other classes and specialisations however depend on *multiple high attributes*.The same goes for *magic items*. This is something you have to consider if you want to take a game in that direction: low attributes during character creation and low magic items *heavily* favors casters in power development / balance &amp; advancement.

**To make it clear**: as a GM you should not target the player for their choice of character (after all you have accepted it in the first place). But you can and should hold the player responsible for the fun of the entire group and that includes preparation and making sure that other players have fun as well. After all the normal tabletop RPG is not a PvP game, but a cooperative game. But I hope I was able to show some solutions to often mentioned issues with summoners, especially the Master Summoner. And maybe the next time you can allow these character types at your table, provided that the player is reasonable. Let the NCPs act as they are, from stupid, but frighteningly straightforward brutes to cunning manipulators, check the rules, as the devil is in the details, and use the above mentioned tricks to speed things up. 

*And yes, maybe that will perhaps lead to your characters charging the orc front lines while standing on burning ankylosauruses ...*

0,0,26,11,"It's your friendly burnt GM here and this week I come with a different perspective and a different me, in a way.

I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible in regards of the RotRL plot.

So we left last time with a PC smacked to death by a mammoth in the most random way. They teleported back home then went to Magnimar and ,to cut fast the first hour of gameplay, they ressed him in the temple of Callistria with few roleplaying and much bitching. They have a Mesmerist with very high diplomacy (+29???) and the ability to take 20 once per day so it's really hard to deny things and not make it pass for straight cockblocking. But I didn't even care.

Then they made a plan for attacking the fortress again using some Divination. But they did not understand the my hints and dove directly in the secondary level. But that's fine. Except for the fact that the caster is quite noob and the other guys metagame practically everything except when there is to remember the existence of Invisibility Sphere. So I had to explain it to the caster because I felt bad for him.

Then they met an ally in the fortress which would explain them some plot and give directions to scout around this level of the dungeon. However as soon as they realized that she knwy where the boss was they read her mind seeing the closest place to the boss room and directly teleported there.

And again, till know I don't even care. Scry and strike is something I incentivize after a certain level.

So they ended up in this hallway with a magic door protected by a mirror that pops out guardians (I made it deliver 2 guardians at a time instead of 1). They went to investigate the door and I made them understand that a password would have been needed to pass the door. I even dropped an hint of where the password would have been. The only player that got the hint was playing the dumb samurai so no one listened to him.

Instead they decided to tear down the door. The first time 4 of them ended up blind. They fought and killed the guardians then went back to Magnimar to have their sight restored. Then they came back there and this time exploited the situation: they focussed the door, destroying it in one turn then killed the guardians once and for all. Now, the point is that they basically smashed their head trough a puzzle and I'm not sure if as a GM I should endorse it. They didn't solve it and instead overpowered it despite knowing the solution.

However they are quite strong and out of control and the only way to put them in check would be to completely deny them.

However my fear is that if players starts to get their favor thing always deny by effect like protection from good (for enchantment), dimensional anchor for teleports and freedom of movement for grapple I would just remove the frustration from me onto them. For example the door could just have been covered in a layer of force right? In this way it would have been much tougher.... However, idk, it doesn't feel particularly good.

I mean, as a GM I always like to outsmart my players instead of overpowering them.

An example: to counter a grapple abuser I prefer Grease to Freedom of Movement. A +10 to CMd moves far away the auto-success zone but let's the player use its signature skill. Freedom of Movement would remove all the fun.

TL:DR My players are good min/maxer, can overpower everything and in general are mechanically good at the game. I can't outsmart them anymore for skill and time reasons. Should I accept it and roll it trough or should I bruteforce back placing some tactical immunities?

Another way to see it is: as a player, if you have built a strong character do you want it to be able to smash almost everything or would you like the occasional/frequent real challenge even if it means that it doesn't follow the rules/it is cooked ad hoc with some specific math?

Hello everyone,

A question came up during character creation for an upcoming game I’ll be running. We are using spheres of power system for the first time and one of the players has the enhancement sphere and the Physical enhancement talent with the intent on self-buffing. 

The issue cam up with the wording and use of the word \_\_always\_\_ in Spheres of Power. Lets look at the ability. 

As a standard action, you may enhance a creature or object within Close range for as long as you concentrate. You may \_\_always\_\_ spend a spell point to allow an enhancement to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.

Now the question becomes what kind of action is it to spend that spell point that you can \_\_“always”\_\_ spend. Initially I thought it would be done as part of the casting but he didn’t believe that to be the case. He intended to cast it as he entered a dungeon and then extend it later. 

Sure, but then I asked well what sort of action would that be? We assumed \_\_free\_\_… 

However, that presented an issue. In looking at a similar power from another sphere we found that it explicitly stated that spending the spell point was a \_\_free\_\_ action, something not stated under the enchantment sphere. Here is that entry from the war sphere for reference. 

As a standard action, you may place a totem. A totem is an effect on a 50 ft + 5 ft per 2 caster level radius area, centered on you, but does not move as you do. Creatures who leave this area lose the effects of your totem. You must concentrate to maintain a totem but may \_\_always\_\_ spend a spell point as a \_\_free\_\_ action to allow a totem to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration.

Now that wouldn’t be a real issue but then I found the enhancement sphere has some nasty debuffs associated with it. Were you able to spend the spell point later to extend the duration it would mean you could cast these debuffs at no cost with the intent of only spending a spell point when an opponent fails. 

That seemed a little strong for me and truly makes me unsure how the spell point is spent for enhancement… if anyone knows I’d love to hear from them, if they have a reference even better. ",Pathfinder_RPG,Spheres of Power; Always…

and I'm not happy. I made the character for flavor and weirdness but the gameplay has been less than ideal. My GM is willing to allow a bit of reworking depending on what I have in mind. So I'm trying to figure out what I could do to make this more viable. 

So what should I do, take a second compatible archetype, or maybe Multiclass? We're level 5 now. I was thinking of taking Twilight Sage, or Blood Arcanist. or maybe I'm just playing it wrong, maybe I'm just not picking the right spells, are there witch spells that are really good that I'm just skipping over?

I posted this pretty late at night and was so tired I forgot to actually explain what's wrong.

Well, it's mostly an issue in a lack of options. During Combat, I pretty much just spend the entire fight shooting with a crossbow (and missing) and outside combat my casting functions are still non-existent.

0,0,9,1,"One of my players got inspired by a new anime that came out recently and wants to have a ""Digimon-like"" experience with his character - meaning not only that he wants to have a loyal intelligent supernatural companion monster-thing, but also that he wants to have the ability for it to ""burst"" with power - meaning he wants it to be relatively less powerful most of the time, and then have it transform into a much more powerful form for short periods of time. I think that to some extent I can accomplish this by creating a custom archetype for the Summoner, but I need a little help with making sure I balance just how long his eidolon can ""boost,"" and also just how much more powerful it should theoretically be when it's boosting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's what I'm thinking so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Duration: basing it off Rage, but since it's a more intense power-boost, make it shorter. I'm thinking ""A number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the Summoner's Charisma modifier + 1 additional round per 2 Summoner levels"".

&amp;#x200B;

For the main gimmick: the Eidolon has 2 forms, a ""normal"" form which is rolled up with stats as if the summoner were  lower-level than he actually is, and a ""boosted"" form, which uses stats that are higher-level than the summoner actually is. The summoner would keep both stat sheets around, and has to update both of them at each level up. I'm thinking at the moment that the gap will start to appear at 2nd level, where the Eidolon's abilities will lag behind by 1 level (meaning it'll still have Lv 1 eidolon stats), but he'll be able to ""boost"" the eidolon by 1 level (giving it 3rd-level stats), and then after that the ""gap"" will widen every 5 levels - meaning at Level 7 the eidolon will be delayed again (giving it Lv 5 stats normally) and it'll be able to boost up 2 levels (giving it Level 9 stats), at Level 12 it's growth will be delayed again (giving it Level 9 stats normally), and it'll be able to boost up 3 level (giving it Level 15 stats temporarily), etc, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also debating about having the gap go up every 4 levels, but I'm worried that might be too powerful.

0,0,74,134,"So, I've been playing with my particular group of players for about a year at this point. We meet once a week and usually play for a few hours. The campaign in question is tied heavily to a lot of very powerful beings who are watching over the players and grant boons, some are Gods and some are deific only in the sense of being powerful enough that most people can't comprehend their might.  None of the deific powers have given them orders, only advice and stated that they were interested in seeing how their path develops.

This is in direct contrast with a huge amount of NPCs, who are directly controlled or ordered to do things by those they serve. In fact its a de facto problem that comes between our version of the Hells and Elysium/Heavens.  The Hells in this game aren't exactly evil as they are Chaotic and while everything is terrifying and dark in these realms for in-game reasons, everyone is free to do as they please.

In the Heavenly realms, everything serves a singular entity and is bound to his will and desires without question. It beautiful, comfortable and no one wants for anything but they can not act with free accord.

The players have just started meeting the Heavenly entities, with one of our players having a number of relationships to the hellbound entities and using them as summoned allies. One of these entities is the child of both realms and the parents had an argument.  The game came to a stop when the father accused the mother of abandoning their off-spring to the hells and the mother claiming that the heavens were no better.

Trying to break the argument, the two asked the party, ""Is it better to suffer and be free or to be comfortable but never able to make your own choice?"".  The game came to a complete halt and we had to end for the night when no one could or wanted to answer.  

How would you all answer this question?

Edit:  I think I worded this very poorly.  I never wanted this to seem like I was complaining about my players, just that I was interested in how other players would handle this situation.  I love my players and know most of them are used to less narrative style play but specifically asked for a roleplay heavy campaign.

Edit 2: Lots of people are bringing up good points but for this little bit of clarity. Neither plane is actually heaven or hell and people who die don't go to them. The two entities are just from diametrically opposed areas. The after-life in said game is entirely undefined by the written lore. In fact, from what I've read in lore, death is you die and your magical life force is shot back into the rotation and made into something else.

At what point is it appropriate to re-write npc stat blocks to keep the game appropriately challenging?

After running three sessions, it's incredibly clear that the party can face-roll whatever is sent their way by the pre-made adventure's book, and it isn't a matter of how tactically sound the creatures act (even uncharacteristically so, in the case of otherwise mindless creatures), or how many are sent (within reason, of course. A million CR 1/3 NPCs still can kill, but what's the fun in that?). 

The reach fighter is able to consistently hit and deal massive damage, would it be out of line to start replacing fighters and warriors with some M*aster of Many Styles* monks with snake style and a decent sense motive? Or Crane Style and Wing?   
How do DMs generally feel about actively going for sundering a PC's toy to ruin their day? Considering the cleric doesn't memorize mending in general, it'd be a good way to ruin the fighter's night, but also seems a bit dickish. It also doesn't really accommodate for the unchained monk who's only really been kept in check by the fact he kept failing saves and was eating dirt most of the time.

Who has used the [Antagonize](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/antagonize/) feat? As a PC, it's a fun and sometimes hilarious ability, but taunting the fighter so he comes out his comfort zone might get dull pretty fast. It also brings the question that while RaW, you could have every encounter go for taunting him, would it be particularly fair? His AC is rather high (only lower than the kineticist at a respectable 17ish, if i had to guess off the top of my head), so he wouldn't be particularly endangered by this, he might get hit once or twice with coordinated NPCs that close in on him and go for flanking.

What about trying to throw in a lot of fear effects? Shaken on the party could be a good detriment, but I have a hard time keeping a medium, humanoid creature capable of both intimidate and reliable damage at such a low level (Fighter 1? Warrior 2?)

I’ve been wanting to use healing bombs since the first time I read them, but well, they suck.  But if I’m going Chirurgeon, I gotta work it into the equation.

Bonus points for being able to switch targets and split between say 2 damaging bombs and 2 CLW bombs in the same round.  

Then I found the “Remedy Extract” discovery.  I’ve completely ignored this every time I’ve come across it, but I can’t for the life of me find any reason that RAW, you couldn’t make healing bombs infused with various alchemical boosts/status cures.

0,0,4,2,"So I've been running a campaign every Sunday, or I did for the last year and a half. It just came to an end, Grand epic high fantasy. All the players had Epic Level items that had all gained reverence and started to apotheosis gods. One of them was a tinker who created the first real feasible airship, it was Grand we're all loving it. Their main enemy was a necromancer turn Lich who was trying together pieces of lamashtu's spear. Using them to become b b e g, he was tired of the dark tapestry he wasn't really trying to do anything profound just become an immortal all-powerful thing  and make way for the old ones. So after a eight year time Jump in game due to planar rips in space-time. The Hero's disappearing because of that gaining a small bit of the following due to their absence, the first time they fought the Lich and save the small mining town now turned large town that worships them. 

Anyway I'm rambling a lot more than that happened but you're  not here listen to me talk about it, I'm here to ask for advice.

The campaign ended in a  spectacular way, their town was sieged by the Lich and his forces, they used the airship to bombard and counter Siege. The battle took place and they all died... Now it's not all bad they did take the Lich with them destroying one of the shards (Piece of  Lamashtu's spear) during one of the players apotheosis, keeping it from ever forming again and now the PCs are gods, reverence of Heroes, is the umbrella term for thier ""Pantheon."" 

Now for the advice part; we're starting a new game. It will be taking place in our version of Golarion, with the time jump and the new gods (Thier old PCs) I guess long ramble short is I'm not quite sure I will start this new campaign. 

Now yeah I know I've been GMing for 13 years and I've been playing Pathfinder first edition since its Inception, but I've been playing with this group for the longest and this is probably the most epic scale campaign I had ever done and so I never really thought about having two GM again after this campaign just wasn't something on my mind at the time.

He kinda is a Minion Master, using Summoning feats, and Summon monster V in Combat. This is often enough to end a average Encounter, when the rest of the Group also do something.
 (He likes to use 1d4+1 Dire Wolfs or Rhinos most of the time) Also he uses Undead as backup, but rarely puts them into the fight other, that block access to him, or to coup de grace a Paralyzed Enemy.

This way he doesn't have to big of an Impact, because often he just skips his Wizards turn, who he always has surrounded with his Undead Bodyguard, who also rarely attack.

However he always gives the Impression, that he could just completly destroy the Enemies, and he often can. He likes to use that Black Tentacle Spell, when he feels like odds are against the rest of the group, and that spell is just stupid, it often removes anyone from the fight but the best Martials.

The best Martial However get removed from the fight quite often with another Conjuration spell, Waterball, that he just summons and rolls around collecting everyone with a poor refelx save.

For everyone else he sometimes uses Searing Ray, to do damage if he wants too, and if an enemy is causing to much trouble, he uses a s Save or suck on them, depending on what he thinks they are weak against (Hold Person / Command Undead Will, Create Pit Reflex, Ghoul Touch Fort)

Also hes pretty hard to take out, since his second highest Score is Con giving him not to shabby Hitpoints, is often surrounded by Undead Minions, who always are just kinda bodyshields and the Teleportation Subschool ability, that allows him to teleport with a Swift Action, then use a move Action to go somewhere safe, and than use a Spell to take out the Danger, and then command some undead Minions to surround him again.

However he always plays this way, that it looks like he could easily win the encounter, but rarely does so, since he doesn't want to take away the fun form the rest of the Party.

0,0,22,6,"I'm a new player trying to come up with a 9/9 caster. (my question is in 2 part) 

*First* : Between the Druid, wizard, psychic, sorcerer, witch, oracle, cleric, shaman and arcanist, with all their respectives archetypes and with the bloodlines, hexes, metamagic feat, etc. I can't seem to understand what role each caster fulfill. Coming from a video game background, I'm used to every class having a well defined role (tank, dps, crowd control, healer, etc) and pathfinder has me confused.

If anyone has rules of thumb for respective roles, I'd like to hear them. 

*Second* : As for my character, one of the caster I enjoyed playing the most was the frost mage in World of Warcraft (in the early day at least). While it was not the strongest/most popular caster in term of dps, fewer ennemies had resist/immunity against it and the slow from cold, freeze chances, increased crit on frozen ennemies, instant cast from brainfreeze and other utility were in my opinion a worthwhile tradeoff when compared to other specialization. 

While I don't care for the element of my pathfinder caster per se (could be cold or anything else), I'd like to have that kind of caster, with increased utility/survivability, the ability to steer the flow of battle with crowd control and debuff and the chance for burst damage if the conditions are right. Immunity/resist will depend on what our GM throw at us, but I'd tend to pick element that tend to be less commonly resisted. 

I'm not big on multiclassing (as I like to keep it simpler and generally like capstone), but I don't mind using archetypes or combining them when possible). 

With that said, what would be your suggestions and why? Thanks!

Let's look at the first hour of last week, remember we are all level two at this point. We all knew we were being followed so I decided to do something. First I roll a fort check to wake up early without fatigue, I roll a 4 and add my +8 so that's fine at 12 o guess. Then I make a stealth check to disappear into the brush, I roll a 3 and add my +7 for a disappointing total of 10.  Next I have to scale a simply hill, it's only 20 ft. And a easy 40 degree angle, I roll a 5 and add my +4 for a total of 9, the gm gives it to me anyway since it's such an easy check but clearly I made alot of noise. Finally I make it to where I suspect our stalker is, expecting to find some tracks or maybe a sleeping bag I roll a perception, I roll a 1 and add my +6 for a whopping 7. I find nothing and head back to camp, I decide to use my BEST skill to get down and jump the incline and roll my acrobatics where I get to add +9 and roll a two! I landed without dmg but landed on my butt. 

I have tried different dice, I have tried other people's dice. I have tried playing more passively and more aggressively, I have even tried sitting in a different spot at the table. This character is just cursed. I have a +5 to accuracy and I still only hit touch AC about a third of the time. The gm and other players have gone past the point of joking about it to genuine sympathy. So what do y'all do? Have secret rituals or dice brands? Maybe I should reprint the character page, or maybe I should just grit my teeth and wait for my inevitable death since I seem to fail every combat save I attempt.

One of my players has gliding wings, and keeps arguing with me that he should be able to use his wings in a dungeon, even if the corridors aren't that wide. (5ft and 10ft). 

He argues that the gliding wings don't say they require X amount of space, but I think its a bit silly/stupid for a medium character to be able to use his wings in a 5ft(or even a 10ft) wide hallway.  *IF* humans/human-like creatures had wings, they would need a wingspan of 20ft(not to mention these still wouldn't work).

0,0,8,1,"Help! My friends and I started playing pathfinder a bit, we are gana do a cycling DM thing, and I am the first one up. I created a dungeon that everyone started in(kinda stolen idea from Legend of Grimrock-a pit for prisoners). 

When I made this dungeon, I made a few traps scattered throughout the dungeon, to add a bit of a challenge that none of the players have experienced before(we are newish).

I added a pitfall trap, in the intersection of a T hallway. I figured this would be dangerous, because it would have to be interacted with at least 3 times if not disabled or anything. I liked this, because it made it very dangerous(part of the hook for the dungeon).

 As a side note, we play on roll 20, and my players have a bad habit of moving their characters around without telling me anything, making things annoying/difficult to handle(it doesn't come from a bad place, its just excitement).

Of course, a player moves himself past this trap...but I am generous, and allow him to backtrack, and make a perception check-*he fails*- and then a reflex-*also fails*-, so he falls in*(normal trap stuff)*. 

Because of where I put it, they are forced to interact with it if they want to backtrack(of course, evil me made one of the choices of path a dead end, so they have to interact with it at least twice). But after interacting with it 2 times (easy 10ft jump/DC10 acro), they have been going through the whole dungeon making sure to check **EVERY** single door  and room. 

I understand they don't want to fall for a trap again if they can help it, and I am not upset or anything about this... Does anyone have a way they handle traps and perception checks for them all so that they don't have to explicitly explain all of this every time they go somewhere?

I allow perception checks for traps, but I don't want to do that, everyone fail, and then think there's a trap and it influence how they do something, but when I try making random perception checks, they always get high and I feel like I cheat them when i say they don't hear anything, not to mention most of those times, when they aren't suspicious, they can tell it is a BS check, and I think I ruin the immersion with them...

 *""The Vudrani smugglers!"", she said out loud and suddenly sat bolt upright. The pounding wasn't just in her head, someone was beating at the door as if meaning to knock it off the hinges. She whipped her head back and forth in time to catch sight of someone at one of the windows, though she quickly regretted the motion.*

 *""She's in there, I see her!"" came the muffled yell from outside.*

 *""Oh shit... shit shit shit SHIT!"" she yelled as the gnome scrambled to her feet. Running past her work table, she grabbed the long cylindrical mana capacitor and started running towards the other side of the room. After a good three or four steps, she stopped.

Absolam, the City at the Center of the World, is the largest, most important city in the known world, just ask anyone who lives there! Founded by a once mortal god who pulled the Starstone from the sea, the ascension point of multiple other living gods, as well as the center of trade for the known world means there’s no end of wondrous things to see and do, which probably explains the relatively high numbers of gnomes who call the city home.

Like most gnomes, Pym’s upbringing was more communal than the standard human or elf’s, and while she can tell you who her parents were, she’d probably have to stop and think about it for a moment or two as it honestly just isn’t that important to her (or any other gnome, for that matter). She discovered her obsession fairly early when she was a fresh faced youth of not more than 30 in the form of machines. Simple clocks that performed marvelously precise movements, The Beast down at The Docks (a crane capable of spinning and lifting many tons of cargo as if it were nothing), and of course… The Clockwork Cathedral in the Merchant district.

By the time she was 40, after only a few years of distractions, she officially started attending formal classes at the Clockwork Cathedral and quickly absorbed everything she could. A bright, young up and comer, she spent as much time studying the Cathedral and it’s Thumpers as she did attending the actual classes being taught by the advanced students, but there’s only so much time one can spend in boring lectures, especially when going white before your time is a factor. By 43 she had learned everything the advanced students had to offer and finally she received her invitation to become an advanced student herself, first class was in two weeks. That is when everything changed.

To celebrate her admission to the upper ranks, her fellow cognates insisted on a night out on the town. A few drinks in reputable establishments turned into a few more drinks at less reputable establishments as the night wore on, and by the wee hours Pym found herself outside the Grogpit, one of the worst dive taverns in all of The Docks (but hey, the drinks are supposed to be dirt cheap, so it had that going for it). As she was about to enter, a large porter came staggering out the door backwards and directly into her. The man’s size said he must have been half ogre, but his face said he wasn’t pretty enough for an ogre. Whatever his questionable lineage, the impact knocked her on her backside several feet from where she had been previously standing. Seconds later, a half orc came out the door swinging at pretty boy, and it took everything Pym had just to dodge out from under their feet as the two exchanged blows.

Though she made it home in one piece that night, she was badly shaken. Not so much by the close call, but by the simple fact *neither of the brutes even realized she was there.* She could have been crushed entirely by accident. For the first time in her life, Pym felt small, weak, and helpless. And she didn’t like it. She was a city gnome, she never had military training, or combat lessons on how to fight someone bigger than she was, but she had her brains. One of the other cognates had been working on a weapon he obtained from an Alkenstar trader, a firearm they called it. A bit of convincing was all it took to let her examine it, the device seemed simple enough. An alchemical powder that exploded when lit, a metal casing to contain the blast which pushed the bullet out, and a trigger mechanism to kick the entire thing off. A few days later, she had a prototype. It didn’t look like the original, but it functioned, and it didn’t really matter if it was small, it packed a real kick!

But it still wasn’t enough. This might end a fight, but it wouldn’t prevent one. It wouldn’t stop her from getting stepped on by something bigger and meaner.  She’d need to be even bigger before anyone would really notice her. They say when the only tool you’ve got is a hammer, all your problems start looking like nails, and this was no exception. Pym was obsessed with engineering, clockwork mechanics, and building magical constructs. So, if she needed to be bigger and stronger, well then she’d just build a suit to make her bigger and stronger. Day after day, night after night she worked, losing all track of time. Her first day of class came and went without her noticing until one of the other cognates came to check up on her. She had missed her one chance; the Cathedral doesn’t let anyone that misses that first class come back and try again for a full year.

Without access to the advanced student workrooms and resources, there was no way she could build the fully magical golem shell she had designed. She tore the design sketches off the table and rolled out a new sheet of paper. Time to scale back the design. If she couldn’t use full on magical constructs, she could supplement it with clockwork pieces, or even simpler mechanisms if she had to. Whatever magical components she couldn’t craft or work around, well let’s just say she “borrowed” from the Clockwork Cathedral. After a few months of work, she had her first practical test build. Like the pistol, it was small, smaller than she wanted, but it worked! Mostly…

As a proof of concept, it was fine, but it needed a lot more work. And raw materials she no longer had, having burned through everything she could get her hands on already. Plus the Cathedral was getting wise to things going missing, security was increasingly almost daily, she wasn’t going to be able to get anything else there either. Here she was, in the biggest trading city on the planet, surrounded by everything she needed… but while she was an opportunist, she was no thief. At least not the kind that breaks into shops and robs innocent merchants, that is. What she needed was coin, and lots of it.

Welp, she could always get a job. Her suit would make her a pretty decent porter, but the pay wasn’t nearly enough for what she needed. Only two ways to make a lot of money quickly in a town like this involved the red silk district, or the gladiator pits. So, she took her pretty little face right down to the Crimson Coin and signed herself up for combat. What? She wasn’t desperate enough to sell HERSELF, but she was pretty sure she could knock a few heads with her prototype suit. That WAS what she designed it for, wasn’t it? It took a bit of convincing to get fat old Torman Iates to let her sign up for the Irorium. Not wanting to see “a tender young thing like yourself”, as he put it, get hurt, he said he’d make sure her opponent went easy on her, “just enough to knock some sense into you”.

100 to 1 odds were what the bookies were giving her, and even that was seen as being overly generous. She still put everything she had left on herself, suited up, and proceeded to slam her opponent into the wall to the amazement and then cheers of the entire crowd. Walking out with a fat purse of gold, it was time to go shopping for parts!

That cycle repeated itself for a while, though the odds increased substantially in her favor and Iates stopped pulling his punches with the opponents pretty quickly, she still managed to make enough money from the fights to fund her research and design. Bigger fights meant bigger purses, bigger purses provided the funding for better suits, and better suits allowed for bigger fights. Plus, she found that she quite enjoyed the fighting. And after every fight won came the victory parties, can’t forget the parties.

After several months of this she became fairly well known around the districts. If she wasn’t fighting for purse money, she was in her rented warehouse workshop bolting together whatever scraps she could find into her ultimate creation. If she wasn’t in her workshop, she was in the markets looking for parts. If not in the markets, she was at the docks seeing what the less savory types could “import” for her. And if not there, she was at the tavern getting toasted by her fans and congratulated for her latest win. Today? Today she was celebrating something special. Her biggest suit to date was almost complete, and she had just bought a bottle of good wine to mark the occasion. The last piece she needed was a suitable crystal she could use as a mana capacitor, and she was supposed to be meeting some Vudrani smugglers down at the port that night to obtain it. She didn’t quite have the money for it, but she was sure she’d figure out something. What was the worst that could happen?

Okay, finally got around to expanding on my favorite character, getting a promo image whipped up that includes a good picture for her mech, and the basic build information.

The important parts of the build (as in the non-obvious stuff) are that she's using the Rich Parents trait (reflavored as winnings) combined with the Master Tinker alternate Gnome racial and the Gunsmithing feat to not only let her start play with a Pistol without dipping into Gunslinger/Gun Chemist/etc and slowing progression on the main aspect of the build, but to give her proficiency with it as well.  Gunsmithing lets her craft guns, Master Tinker lets her be proficient in anything she personally crafts, and Rich Parents gives her the cash boost needed to afford the 500 gp crafting cost of a pistol with enough left over for other assorted gear.

The next several feats for her are Amateur Gunsmith, Craft Wondrous Item, and Catch Off-Guard.  That will give me the grit I need to quick clear jams with the pistol, and Catch Off-Guard will let me do things like grab whatever is handy to beat people with when the slams alone aren't enough.  Might even take Shikigami Style if I can fit it in with the crafting feats I'll need to take.

For the Eidolon, it gets to start at Medium which is nice.  Evolution route will be mostly size/damage/armor boosts.  I do plan on technically taking Extra Limbs and more Slams, but keeping them flavored as still being a biped with 2 arms and is just swinging them around more.  When it gets big enough, I'll take things like Trample, and see about getting a Permanent Enlarge on the Eidolon.

Gear wise, other than the obvious stuff like an Eidolon harness to help protect against Banish, I'll be making Wand Key Rings and flavoring them as basically a sabot or a converter so the mech can use attack wands as ""batteries"" for offensive ranged attacks (magic missile easily becomes a macross missile barrage, for example).

For Pym herself, I'm looking at armor being an Arachnid Harness (reflavored to mechanical legs instead of spider legs) and of course her pistol and wrench because hey, if I'm aiming at all the size increases I'm not going to fit in most dungeons, so gotta have some capability out of the mech too.

0,0,10,11,"So on Wednesdays my husband runs Giant Slayer for our group. We recently arrived at the Vault of Thorns, killed Ewigga, and are currently in the middle of battle with the giant dragonfly. Our characters are: a half-orc cleric, a Kitsune Shaman, a human warpriest, and Sylph ranger. 

Anyways, the start of the battle goes as follow:  the ranger hops on to a couple of giant lily pads, scouting out the area when the rest of the party is ambushed by the entangled spell on the platform. Soon the giant dragonfly attacks our ranger, thus starting initiative, the ranger passes his knowledge check and we get information about what it was (Fey), he delays his turn until the Shaman can try to talk to the dragonfly in Sylvan and see if they could spare its life. Unfortunately the Shaman fails her diplomacy and they begin to attack the creature. The rest of the round goes smoothly with the cleric beginning to cast enlarge person on himself to get out of entanglement, the ranger shooting at it and the war priest shooting as well. Everything is going smoothly right?

Wrong! The next round comes and the Shaman, hoping to not get entangled, decides to push her luck and jump onto the lily pad. She fails her acrobatics and falls 100 feet downward and onto the compost below, taking 11 non lethal damage and 25 lethal. Could have been a lot worst. Her next action? Heal herself. The dragonfly soon grapples the  ranger. The cleric is large, tries to step onto a lily pad, but since the cleric is basically a tin can, the lily pad gives and the cleric has to make an acrobatic check to grab onto the ledge, which he succeeds and begins to release his enlarge person spell.

Next round comes and the ranger orders his roc to attack, the Shaman begins summoning a small air elemental, the cleric is still hanging on the ledge, and the war priest is still shooting the dragonfly with his light crossbow.

Now comes the next round and an air elemental attacks the dragonfly, the ranger reversed the grapple on it with the help of his roc thus plummeting to the compost below, going unconscious but not dying, and the war priest helps the cleric up.

So some backstory, I normally don't like secret rolls. Because I like player agency (even if the dice are still random). But the playtest really seemed to push the secret tag and so I gave it a try. One of the thing that struck me as less then optimal is how to do it. First thing of course was to write down each players modifier. Because asking for the specific skill or the whole sheet each time kind of gives a way the moment.

But still the rolling and then the time to look everything up also kind of gives it away. So rather than buying fluffy dice on a soft underground I was thinking of automatising this process.

So that is why I made this app. With the following features:

* Starts up with commonly used skills that have secret rolls
* Add/edit/delete skills yourself
* Save as many PCs as you want (add/edit/delete)
* Edit each PCs skills (name, proficiency rank, modifier)
* Pick a skill and get an overview for each PC rolled
* Reroll the whole party or individually
* Pick a target DC to generate an outcome (succes, critical success, failure, critical failure)
* Has a helper to pick a target DC based on table 10-2: Skill DCs by level and difficulty

Next steps are making a layout more suited for tablet, and maybe drag and drop to order stuff around. And obviously once PF2 drops make it up to date for that if needed.

####Appearance  

Grisly fetishes and the rags of once fine clothes hang off the corpse-thin frame of this horrifying, sharp-fanged crone.

####CR   9
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Disease (Su) Demon Fever: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 20; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage (target must save a 2nd time or 1 point of the damage is drain instead); cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Dream Haunting (Su) A night hag can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil targets by using a special periapt known as a heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once it does so, it rides on the victim’s back until dawn. The sleeper suffers tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions by confronting and defeating the night hag.

Heartstone (Su) All night hags carry a heartstone—a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt. A heartstone’s magic is fueled by the hag’s spirit and proximity—once separated from its owner (or upon the hag’s death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.

####Ecology  

Terrifying murderesses and greedy soul brokers, night hags prey upon mortals while they’re most vulnerable. Preferring to kill their prey slowly, haunting their dreams night after night, these hags trap the tormented souls of their victims within dark gems so they might be sold in the infernal markets of the outer planes. Night hags vary widely in appearance, standing between 5-1/2 and 7 feet tall, and weighing from 150 to 300 pounds.
Customizing Hag Covens
Source Blood of the Coven
Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags—among the most powerful of mortal hags—relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag’s monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: animate dead, baleful polymorph, bestow curse, clairaudience/clairvoyance, commune, dream, forcecage, mind blank, reincarnate, speak with dead, veil, vision

The Night Hag adds the following spells to the coven: contagion, finger of death, major curse, maze, nightmare

0,0,90,129,"So I'm reading a rather interesting book on filmmaking called ""Save the Cat"" by Blake Snyder and thinking that a lot of what he talks about for making a good movie script works just as well for making a good RPG character.

The logline (or one-line) is the one or two sentence description of the movie, the ""What is it?"" that sums it up as best as possible while trying to entice you into wanting to know more.

The rules for making a good movie logline as he lays them out are:

1) Irony - The unexpected twist, the thing that makes you perk up and want to know more, the hook.  ""A cop comes to LA to visit his estranged wife and her office building is taken over by terrorists"" (Die Hard).  Because one doesn't expect a mundane office visit to end in a terrorist hostage situation.

2) A compelling mental picture.  It should be something that automatically has the reader filling in the blanks of where they expect the story to go.  It should also tell a timeframe and a location.  Up there with the Die Hard logline, it clearly gives you the mental outline of ""Okay, so the cop is going to have to fight the terrorists inside the office building, and probably win his wife back"", while telling you ""Oh, so most of it is going to take place in this office building, and its going to take place probably in a single day's time"".

3) Audience and cost.  This one is more for the movie pitch stuff, but it should give an idea of who the target audience is (is this a young adult comedy, old people western, etc) and an idea of how much its gonna cost (""cop fights terrorist in an office building"" is clearly cheaper to shoot as a concept than ""hotshot starship fighter pilot destroys an entire armada"").

4) A killer title.

So, thats for movies, how does this translate to a character concept?

Well, lets start with the basic idea.  A one or two sentence description of the character.  It needs to have some sort of interesting twist as to why anyone would care.  It should give a good image of roughly what to expect from the character (is this a melee fighter, is it a spellcaster?).  And, it should set the tone for the ""feel"" of the character (is this a lighthearted jokester, a cringy edgelord?).  And of course, what is their name?

The more I think about this, the more attractive it becomes as a way to solidify an initial concept.  As the author puts it, ""If you can't come up with a good logline that reels people in, you probably don't have that good of a story yet"".  As you work to get that ironic twist in there, it forces you to start thinking of overall plot dynamics and the challenges the character (movie) has to overcome.  After all, if the best quick description of your character is ""He's a fighter with a greatsword and power attack"" then you probably don't actually have a character concept, you just have a generic build.

So, stop and think about your character.  What would their logline be?  What is that one or two sentence pitch line that would make a GM go ""I want that in my game, tell me more""?

I'll give my favorite character a go to kick things off.

0,0,35,4,"Guess it's time to drop the pretense, and ask what I \*really\* mean.

&amp;#x200B;

My DM is great. I'm not saying anything bad about him, or my group as a whole. But, as this first game has carried on, and my character (Thalen, Fey-templated Elven Internal Alchemist) has more and more proven himself the odd man out, I've realized something.

&amp;#x200B;

...He isn't anime enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that's an \*absurdist\* statement on its own, but, let me explain. Much of my group is invested fairly heavily into quite a few different media. From MMOs, to Anime, to vintage american cartoons, games both video and traditional, you name it, someone's into it.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to this game, however, there's a decidedly animesque bent to it. ...The whole thing being set in not!Japan should've been my first clue, but, hindsight's 20/20 and all that. It's also worth noting that not a single one of the characters in the party is, as far as I can tell, a direct copy of something. They're all original characters.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, you have a Mind Blade Magus, a Sword Saint Samurai, a Student of Stone Monk, a Sniper Rogue... ...And an Alchemist.

&amp;#x200B;

One of these things is not like the others.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a ""personality"" issue. Thalen's well-liked enough by the players that, if I overhauled his personality now, I'd probably catch flak for it. This is purely an issue of style, and combat tactics. How does one take an Alchemist who, thus far, has relied almost entirely on Bombs for combat, and smoothly move that over into something closer-quarters, more visually appealing?

&amp;#x200B;

What weapon would he use? Would he even \*use\* a weapon, given that Internal Alchemists are meant to multiclass Monk(and I guess Ninja/anything else with a Ki pool), and we're \*rapidly\* closing on Lv20 with no end in sight?

&amp;#x200B;

Ninja Edit: I have no idea if that's the right flair, but, it's what I'm using.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, being an idiot, Edit: Right. Playstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

As a combatant. Thalen will usually begin with his Grand Mutagen already in effect, pumping Dex, Con, and Str (in that order), and begin lobbing Bombs. He's not got quite the breadth of status that a normal Mad Bomber does, though. His go-to strat is to knock you prone with Force Bombs, then glue you to the ground with Entangling Bombs. Once thusly glued, you're effectively a non-threat, and he moves on to the next. If the above isn't possible, he falls back to elemental damage, and just goes full Nova to deal with you as quickly as possible. He usually carries a holdout weapon or two, in the event his bombs run dry... But, to-date, that's never happened.",Pathfinder_RPG,"""It needs to be about 20% more anime."" - Me, about my character."

+2 STR, +2 WIS, -2 INT

Medium

Speed 30 ft

Darkvision 60 ft

**Brutish Fighting:** not-Desmodu are naturally ambidextrous, and favor wielding two weapons. They have developed their own unique techniques for dual-wielding combat, and may use their Strength score in place of Dexterity to qualify for the Two-Weapon Fighting feat and any feats which have it as a prerequisite.

**Loping Run:** not-Desmodu gain a 10-foot racial bonus to their speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions, but only if they are not wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.

**Enhanced Hearing:** not-Desmodu have exceptional hearing, nearly to the point of being able to navigate blind. They gain Blind-Fight as a bonus feat, and have a +2 racial bonus on hearing-based Perception checks, and on checks to locate an invisible opponent.

**Sonic Vulnerability:** As a consequence of their sensitive ears, not-Desmodu are particularly vulnerable to loud and disorienting sounds, taking a -4 penalty to saves against sonic spells and effects.

During their first session, I gave my druid player an egg, figuring, ""Egh, who doesn't love a fucking egg"", you know?

My current thought is Wyvern.

EDIT: To clarify on a few things, first of all the player is playing as a young elf. They have a LOT of years to care for this thing, and on top of that they have been caring for the egg quite well. They already have an animal companion, a tiger, which they split their soul in order to make live as long as they do (long story). The rest of the party wouldn't feel overshadowed or anything from it being something hecking sweet, as basically everyone in the party collects animals except our old monk, who instead if kinda the pet of an animal herself.

I was originally playing a Conjuration wizard, and the rest of our party was a halfling rogue, dwarf lion shaman druid, and a paladin.

I'm looking to GM a pathfinder group in my area with some people that are new to tabletops (they have only played 5E for less than a year, and are all new and self taught).  I myself used to play pathfinder for just under a year (with a group of experienced players). I really enjoyed the experience I had playing way back when, and always wanted more of it. Recently we started talking about playing tabletop together during the summer. I recommended pathfinder because that was what I had experience with, and they wanted something more substantial than 5E (which imo pathfinder provides), and I said I would GM (because I have always wanted to GM as well as play more). I'm fairly familiar with the mechanics of it, and easily can brush up on them myself before starting.

My questions to you guys are:

A) Is there any good resources that I could look over in being a good GM overall?

b) Resources for GMing in Pathfinder specifically?

c) Resources for helping in character creation (I had help for each of my... 5 character deaths in the campaign for making characters by the GM)

d) recommendations for a scenario or a 3 session campaign to give them a taste of pathfinder to see if they like it. Before I invest in a campaign book and see it sadly go to waste... It would also be nice to have premade, or semi-premade characters b/c of point C.

Also, if anyone could direct me to a discord or the like, where I could come in and ask specific questions about materials, rules, ideas, etc. as I undergo GMing school.

I have two questions really, will this effect how much I can throw at my players? They'll be fighting almost exclusively Demons and Daemons. The players are 8th level, a Kinteicist, a Barbarian, something inspired by Yu Yu Hakusho and possibly a Rogue

Regarding the Kineticist, I'm concerned about Burn and his immunity to Non Lethal Damage. As written, he shouldn't be able to accept burn to buff his powers at all, which is pretty shitty for him.

Should I say his immunity doesn't apply to his burn damage or let him accept burn without consequences?

I like the second option, because I'm hoping the undead traits will let them feel super powerful, just in time for me to bring them back to life for the final battle, but I am concerned he'll overshadow everyone else.

0,0,3,4,"So, I am looking to build an NPC Summoner who's eidolon is drastically different in alignment- A Sarenite ""cleric"" who has a devil eidolon. The... ""cleric"" is looking to redeem her eidolon, while the eidolon seeks to draw her away from the faith.  


My problem, however, is I could have sworn that there was a mechanical option to allow one to do this- At first I thought it was an archetype, but I couldn't find anything. Then I thought I might have been mis-remembering a spiritualist or occultist thing... But my searching has ended up in vain. This drives me nuts, as I can usually pinpoint the exact crunch needed to make my builds work, but I'm at my wits end.  


So, tl;dr. I'm trying to pinpoint some sort of Feat, trait or other mechanical crunch that would allow a summoner to ""ignore"" the usual 1-step alignment requirements with their Eidolon.

0,0,7,11,"So, a bit of a story here; I hope this all belongs here, if not I'll take it down ASAP, but:

I've been in a game for about 6 months now, with my current arcanist character going for 4 months now. I built them around what the campaign had been, and I figured it was going to continue to be; more by-the-books, generic TTRPG goodness, what with the four combats per rest, dungeon-delving goodness that I feel like the average player craves - not ALL players, of course, but at the very least, me!

Since those four months of running my character, two six-hour sessions per week, we've had very, very few planned out combats. Two, to be precise; one against two beefy gnolls, which was designed more to let the martials shine, and one against a deathknight, which was... also designed more to let the martials (er, the paladin specifically) shine. I say ""planned"" combats to exclude the ""single wolf in a field"" random encounters, and the ""two animated objects"" encounters that happened 16 times in a hallway. Other than that, we've been doing almost a systemless RP; very little rolling, just talking to people and the occasional puzzle. And I get that some people like that kind of game; I'm just not one of them. It makes me feel like my character's useless and I'm not playing the game, even trying my hardest to interact with it.

The reason I've kept playing is the idea that, oh, maybe next session we'll finally encounter a combat, and I'll get to use x cool ability to do y cool thing! But I'm realizing now that this is probably (see: certainly) wishful thinking.

Problem is, the GM and I are really close, and I'm worried they'll take it personally if I choose to abandon the game. I've tried to make it clear that they're not ""failing"" me, and that it's their game, and me not being into that gameplay style isn't a ""fault"" of the game. Hell, I've even talked to them about making a character that would better fit the game; all I got was ""it's up to you and the party to decide if you want to roll a new character"", and ""I don't understand your current character's abilities even after being given their sheet so I can't help you.""

What do I do in a situation like this? I feel stuck in a weird mixture of social norms and gameplay that doesn't sit right with me. Am I expecting too much of a game, or is this situation way outside the norms of Pathfinder? I don't want to give up my only way to play, but as the saying goes, no D&amp;D is better than bad D&amp;D, right?

0,0,6,2,"Hello everyone and my fellow pathfinders,

&amp;#x200B;

just a quick question. I am fooling around with a build for our upcoming campaign. I want to play a Alchemist(Vivisectionist) that does a 3 level dip into Unchained Rogue (Knife Fighter). The stacking of the sneak attack is pretty easy to figure out, or is it? The levels of both, Alchemist and Rogue, stack in this case to determine the number of sneak attack dice, this part is easy. But the Knife Fighter changes the d6 into a d8 when dealing damage with a knife or dagger and d4 for all other weapons. Is this true only for the 3 Rogue levels or does this extend to the sneak attack dice gained via my Alchemist levels, too? Would be much more convenient to deal +5d8 sneak attack damage instead of +1d8 and +4d6, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

And how does this interact with the bomber rogue talent? As I read it the bombs deal damage as the Rogues sneak attack, and as they are not in the least knife shaped, I would recon that they deal d4's in damage.

0,0,10,0,"So I'm a new GM who's running a custom campaign in the Eberron campaign setting. During character creation, the party's cleric came to me asking to play the [Ascetic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/archetypes/kobold-press/ascetic/) archetype since he wanted his cleric of Desna to be more of a free wanderer aesthetic. A quick glance immediately told me it was OP, so I got rid of its Bonus Feats and its Mind is Body ability since those abilities didn't trade out anything from the base cleric. Yeah, it has better skills all around but I let it slide since there isn't any Knowledge guys in the party anyways. The Wis to AC thing I just assumed would even out anyways since they can't wear armor.

Hoo boy was that a mistake. The party's level 6 now and the cleric's AC is staying within a stone's throw of the team's frontline without even trying, he has the best CMD, the best movement options, arguably the best skill loadout, and since he also Variant Multiclassed into Draconic Bloodline he'll be rocking some god-tier AC by the end of this campaign.

The rest of the party consists of a Warpriest, a Psychic Warrior, a Swashbuckler, and an archer Rogue. The Cleric seems content to stay on the backlines with his 10 Str but is noticeably more influential in battle than the others. Do y'all think I need to step in and nerf him, or could I probably get away with leaving the situation as-is?

0,0,28,43,"Hi. So my boss/friend/old roommate wants to try his hand at Pathfinder with his new girlfriend. 

The task has fallen on to me to GM a one off for them. 

I was thinking of running a simple one off dungeon similar to Blackfang's from the beginner box since that's how I was introduced and I don't want the game to run more than one session, which usually happens when I try to run a PFS scenario, because people just spend to much time in towns and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

I originally thought the best way to do it was to just present them with some preset characters, but my buddy wants to build his own since to him one of the biggest appeals is Character creation.   
Character creation, for me personally, is also one of the biggest hurdles in the game. Because with all the extra material available, it can be extremely overwhelming to go through all the class choices, feats, traits and spells. Specially for someone new. 

I know a big issue with my Girlfriend playing the game is when she's creating a character, opens HeroLab and has literally 700 level 1 spells to choose from. Even worse with Traits. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought I'd start them off with just the CRB. But I also know that my friend usually likes to think up more weird characters. I asked him once and he said he would like to make a fire based sorcerer like a pyromaniac.   
So for now I gave him the CRB and the Advanced Players Guide (since it's the book that set Pathfinder aside from D&amp;D), and told him if he didn't find anything he liked to let me know and I would help him build a character that fit his ideas better.   


I'm also thinking of explaining as little of the rules to them as possible and using a more narrative approach of just them telling me what they want to do and me narrating what happens.   
Example ""as the Goblin moves rushes past you, you see an opening in his defenses. Giving you an opportunity to strike/""  
As opposed to ""He passed through your threatened area. You can do an attack of opportunity""

0,0,52,15,"So I wanted some unbiased feedback on a situation I'm having now but it requires a little bit of set up. I'm relatively new to GM'ing (and tabletops as a whole) and have actively been playing for a couple of months now. We are currently in a narrative and combat heavy campaign à la Lord of the Rings. Our group consists of Me, Person A, B, C, and D. Person A and B have been playing for 5 and 10 years respectively while Person C and D started at the same time as me. Recently five sessions in Person B got bored of her Inquisitor and wanted to change her character so they left the party and she rerolled a new dreadnought barbarian. In session six Person A got his oracle character killed from recklessness and rerolled a new human brawler with kitsune heritage. Meanwhile C and D are still rolling with their Samurai and Ranger.

Here is where the question begins. Person B is using a half giant with a weapon that does 3d6 per swing. She now likes to brag about how she can do upwards of 40 dmg per swing. Person A can dish out 40 dmg as well with flurry of blows and had challenged the samurai to a duel only to one shot her entirely. Needless to say Person C and D are upset at these new characters and feel completely useless in comparison in combat situations, especially since the Samurai was supposed to be the muscle of the group before hand. They are no longer having fun now. Not only that but now I'm stressing out over what monsters I can take that aren't just push overs for A and B while also trying to not absolutely murder them by giving A and B a challenge. Plus with no healers anymore the team cannot handle the official monsters who can soak up more hits without being wiped out themselves.

Did I make a mistake by letting A and B choose what they did? Or are they taking advantage of my inexperience and naivety. Regardless, what can you advise to help the situation level out and how do I avoid situations like this in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The 3d6 weapon mentioned in the post is a large sized Earth Breaker hammer paired with the half giant utilizing powerful build. So she has this 3d6+6 damage with BAB allowing two attacks so that is a potential 48 with a perfect set of rolls. Plus things like cleave/greater cleave/power attack and the rage will come into effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: The team comp had a tank (samurai yojimbo), ranged dps (ranger), oracle (healer), and melee dps and utility (inquisitor). This is how they all agreed to start the campaign and it was balanced(ish) before.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3: The Brawler (was oracle) has a tendency to min max in any game we play (tabletop, video game, etc) and is hyper competitive. His oracle healed out the wazoo and basically made the team immortal, damage never stayed for more than a round on the whole party so I began to use stronger monsters that could dish out big numbers and some that did con damage. This meant more hp on the monster encounters and the oracle player began to complain that we were not killing enemies fast enough so he wanted damage and then his oracle drowned so he saw his chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 4: When talking to one they simply say that ""it's not their fault that person C and person D have built their characters wrong IE too weak by Person A and B's standards. When asked to tone it down they get upset and say ""why should I be punished for knowing how to play the game? They have access to the same resources as me, so why am I punished?""",Pathfinder_RPG,Advice on Character Power?

It seems like a really good weapon with some handy abilities, and is worth literally more than the whole party has on us combined.

The thing is, the Cleric already has a keen rapier so declined, the Fighter can only do what he does with a bo staff because he's a Muscle Wizard, which means it got handed to my Sorcerer, who has a +4 to melee but is at least proficient with light maces. I'm not opposed to using it if anything gets up in her grill, and the Tiny Hut ability could be really, really handy for ranged attackers, especially if it moves with the rod. But it's not what she's optimised for - she's meant to be a blaster, firing off lightning bolts and scorching rays.

If it's not much use, we could sell it for some headbands/belts. The thing is, because of where we are we've determined that there is probably nobody who can even *afford* this thing. Our own expedition doesn't have the liquid assets to pay us for it, and I can't imagine the other expeditions have more even if we were willing to sell it to them. I've thought about taking Bull's Strength to replace a spell at 8th level, but I don't know if a blaster being better with a mace is worth a spell slot, or whether a +6 bonus is enough to keep up with the other party members.

So, what do we do with it? We have a ranger who occasionally plays, but isn't always available and if seems wasteful to give such a weapon to them.

0,0,2,0,"Alignment is considered a core part of the game. When you tell a friend about your new character, it’s one of the first things they ask; like the gender of a new baby.

But what if it’s holding us back?

“If you don’t know you villain well enough to explain why they’re the hero, you don’t know your villain well enough.” This anonymous quote about writing novels is just as pertinent to tabletop gaming, if not more so. No one thinks of themself as evil, in the way that we often seem to mean it. Even Demons don’t think of themself as ‘wrong’ or ‘bad,’ in an ethical sense. They just have *different motivations.*

Stated alignment is a crutch. It prevents players from really needing to think about why their character would take – or not take – a certain action. An example:

Once there was a character on a pirate ship who believed that the giant plant growing spikes through their vessel wanted a life sacrificed to let them pass. He held an unconscious pirate over the board of the ship, and then stopped. He stopped because he didn’t have a stated alignment, so he had to think. If he’d been ‘evil,’ he’d just have thrown her over. ‘Good’ and he wouldn’t have. But he was just a guy, in a weird and stressful situation, so he had to really think and feel into the action he was considering; just like someone would in real life. It wasn’t academic; this was a woman’s life, literally in his hands. The *lack* of alignment made it real for that player.

There is no alignment in our game. Instead, players spend some time really fleshing out what motivates their character. What do they believe, and what do they want? What prior experiences inform their decision-making process? Instead of just declaring that they act in a lawful fashion, players know *why* their character behaves that way, which allows them to better understand when they might *not* behave ""lawfully"". Basically, we create characters as subjective experiences of people, instead of objective representations of people. When confronted with a decision or situation, they can refer to these beliefs and desires to inform their actions. *Other* characters or players may think of a given character as good or evil, but the players/characters themselves do *not* think in these terms.

For example, the Barbarian's Rage grants conditional bonuses, but their Come and Get Me feat that relies on rage grants enemies a circumstance bonus to attacks. While it makes sense that Rage is a condition that is affecting the Barbarian, I can't say the same about the feat. Come and Get Me could be argued to be just as much a condition as Rage, that the Barbarian is subjecting herself to, or that it's a circumstance that she allows to take place. It's all very arbitrary.

A better example; Monks get conditional bonuses from most of their stances, but they also gain a conditional bonus to speed from Incredible Movement. I could argue that taking on a stance is a strategy, thus a circumstance, but I could argue that the stance is also a condition the monk is subjecting himself to. Incredible Movement makes absolutely no sense to me as a conditional bonus, what condition is the Monk under? His training?

Maybe I'm not getting it but the distinctions seem arbitrary to me. And as a designer, it worries me that I won't be able to properly create balanced content. It would be awesome if I got some official feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've created a campaign and realized that it is almost an unintentional batman and Robin scenario.  setting up the meeting scene with only two pcs, one wants to be a rouge, the other a paladin.

The problem that I'm facing is, I've never had a Rouge character in any of my campaigns; although this would be a revenge/redemption mission, I'm not finding much use for the Rouge's skills.

The only Rouge character that I've had was me, and I did broken things as a rouge-wizard that would attempt to put people to sleep and sneak attack them for the kill.

&amp;#x200B;

I am running a one-shot tomorrow night and I have a story outline but could use some creative editing. Here is the outline I have for the story thus far:

1. Players are slaves on a boat. A bad storm begins to form and eventually creates an opportunity for the slaves to escape. Amidst the confusion, they find a way off the boat and into the water. They make their way to a nearby island. 
2. Landing on the island, the players explore and set up camp. Trying to find food and resources to survive. They are met by some  gigantic farm animals which they discover can talk (quite intelligently). These farm animals tell them they have escaped from a farm just north of there. The players learn the island is a giant farm run by giants! The giants use these farm animals to do all their labor for them. The farm animals are sick of it and need the adventure's help to escape. If they do so, the farm animals promise to get the adventures off the island and to safety. 
3. The adventures plan a way to break the animals free from this giants farm - hopefully without causing too much commotion. I imagine some sneaking, a bit of combat, some trickery. I'm thinking of maybe three scenes - a chicken coop, a pigs pen, and a cow pasture. 
4. Once the players finish their escape/rescue, they conclude by finding their way off the island (I haven't figured that out yet).

####Appearance  

This humanoid salamander carries a gnarled staff in one hand. Tendrils drape its chin, resembling the beard of an eccentric hermit.

####CR   5
#####Alignment:  CN
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Suffocating Water (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause the water surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect—vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move—it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi’s Hit Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years.

Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards—another amphibious race often encountered in proximity to vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger—a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.

0,0,13,2,"I guess I'll lead with how I've been achieving the above in my campaign. I've introduced a metal called Anchorite, which prevents teleportation. It fills a lot of loopholes in the game around teleportation, i.e. why any wizard can't teleport into the king's bedroom and CDG him in his sleep. Manacles or other bindings made of Anchorite prevent the bound creature from teleporting, Anchorite curtains or rebar create walls which block teleportation. Obviously, the metal is semi precious (priced equal to mithral), but as levels went up, the cost was less significant.

My players are now level 16. They have more resources than they can count, and every other enemy is playing rocket tag (though I try to avoid it). However, they're stuck with a GM (me) who hates the fifteen-minute adventuring day, and forces them into multiple encounters in a single day. This frees me up to make more varied encounters, lets the martials shine, and forces the casters to use the depth and breadth of their power (not just top 2 spell levels). At their current high level, this means not only mundane preventative measures such as enemies at their escape or countdowns to failed tasks, but also magical means, such as Anchorite everywhere, AMFs, and straight-up dimensional anchors. 

My issue is two-fold:

1.  This not only creates an environment where players are more likely to meet their doom, or at least face more dire straights, it's also more difficult for them to retreat should things go south. What's a good way to balance preventing resting after every fight with not making every defeat a TPK?

2. Is this an unfair way to run encounters? This is more a sanity check. My players seem unable to comprehend that there may be more than 1 or 2 fights in their day, or rather unwilling to conserve resources. Using high level spells in encounters that are already under control, etc. Do you other GMs in high level campaigns simply allow the spells and days to flow like wine? How do your martials and other characters not as restricted to daily abilities keep up?

Currently I've got an apocalypse countdown with only a couple of days left, and my players seem rather ignorant of it when deciding to rest. So they're in the home stretch to stop it, which puts them in a heavily fortified mage's tower (with teleportation prevention to keep enemies out of the upper floors). They've pushed through an area leaving a large force behind them, and with 2 encounters and a boss fight to go, have burned through most of their spells (on lower level guards, etc. In the first 2 encounters). They shouldn't be able to escape, they shouldn't want to escape, but they're going to try. Ultimately, I'd rather them perish trying to stop the apocalypse than survive and fail, but that's not my call to make. I just hate the ""ding, times up. No rolls, here's what happens."" of the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently playing my very first game of Pathfinder. For my first class I wanted to play a half-orc bard because I liked the idea of a big, massive, orc playing an instrument ect... However, after the first two sessions I am kinda taken aback on how the bard behaves. I had imagined my pc to be a bit more brawly and beeing able to do a bit more damage than i expected, especially spellwise.

Does anyone here have Tips on how to better play a bard? For this campaign I am in a party with a Ranger, a Barbarian and a Sorcerer. My stats are Str: 15, Dex: 14, Con: 12, Wis: 8, Int: 12 and Cha: 17. also i have also choosen the combat castig feat.

As I am really not that sure on how to play a bard properly any help would be apreciated.

0,0,2,1,"[Deific Obedience](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Deific%20Obedience) is a single feat that nets some special benefits depending on the god. Combined with [Irori](https://aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Irori) an unarmed character could get some incredible boons especially the Evangelist's Inevitable Fist which increases your effective size for attacks and the Sentinel's Secrets of the Enemy which grants a free +2 to Atk/Dmg against one enemy.

I am not sure if it is optimal but I do enjoy the flavor. [Sentinel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/sentinel/) has weaker benefits but maintains BAB progression and nets a free +1Atk/Dmg when dipping into the prestige class, although the 2 skill ranks hurts. 3 free casts of haste a day are fantastic though.

[Evangelist](https://aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Evangelist) is the one I am really looking into though. Good skill ranks, auto progression in a class of your choice, at the cost of d8 HD and lower BAB. In theory I could just dip 4 levels at the cost of -1 to BAB for 3 levels of progression in my main class. I would go all the way but I am missing out on BAB significantly already.

Finally there is [Divine Fighting Technique](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/divine-fighting-technique-combat/) which seems kinda interesting but not worth investing into for unarmed strikes. Most Unarmed damage comes from enchantment bonuses or from Str/Power Attack so I don't see the need for a free average roll on the die. I guess it is useful at higher levels when its a free 10 damage instead of a possible 2.

0,0,58,281,"Hello everyone! As you're all well aware, I didn't put out an update for February and I am sorry for that. My wife and I found out from our landlord that the house (we were renting a bottom level) was being sold, and we had to quickly start packing and find a new place to move.

That said, I can't go more than a few days without getting itches to get back to work, and I've still been busy while Kat and I have been packing and house hunting. Devin has, as usual, been his amazing self and kept up with more data entry while I've worked on changes to the site's front-end. We finally found a new place to rent a couple weeks ago and moved in 3 days ago, so all's well there now. I'm writing this post balancing the keyboard on my lap and using a TV on a bookshelf as my display, but the unpacking shall happen soon!

As for the changes, I'm happy to announce that some significant progress and long-needed updates are finally here. The main thing I wanted to talk about was the recent outages and the site's load times. I'm hoping you all have seen a significant improvement on the second part, as the outages were directly related to me finally becoming fed up with my old host and moving to a VPS (Virtual Private Server). While I originally intended this to provide more reliable uptime for the site and advanced notifications of maintenance, this had an unintended side effect.

For some time now I've struggled with the best way to deliver content to the users - I thought I had figured out the right way to do output caching of the pages in the last update, but my tests showed mixed results. Sometimes it seemed to work, other times it didn't trigger at all. I did figure out one mistake I'd been making when it came to a Parameter-specific field, but even with that change the caching was intermittent. Then, I moved the site. I still am unsure on the why, but once I was fully moved over to my lovely new Server VM, caching started working! I was skeptical at first, not sure on why it failed to work on shared hosting while working on the VPS, but after repeated testing from multiple computers/networks, it seems like I've finally gotten it fixed. In truth, all of you should have seen the changes already - for about a week now the site has been on the new VPS, and load times are better than ever.

Now, some of you probably have still seen some slowness here and there - to test things out, I set the code to only retain a cached copy of a specific page for 1 hour. The first time a page was loaded without an existing cache, speeds were as they were - alright someplaces, bad on others. For the next hour afterwards, however, users would get the cached version and the page would load in a few seconds. With this update, I'm increasing the cache limit to a full day, so as soon as anyone at all checks a page in a given day, for 24 hours after all should see quick speeds getting to that page. This is especially useful for many of the Spells pages, Feats, Wondrous Items, and other historically longer loading areas.

A lot of this is probably like a 5-year old gushing about how he figured out the multiplication table to a seasoned web developer, but for someone who ultimately programs as a hobby, this was extremely satisfying to finally get working. The last month has been a ball of chaos and stress, but today making this update I'm very happy where everything's landed. Thanks so much to all who emailed and commented with tips and suggestions!

Without further inducing of a TL;DR status, here's the updates!

####Appearance  

This snake-bodied creature has five necks, each with a regal, humanoid face in a cobralike hood.

####CR   11
#####Alignment:  LN
#####Size:   Huge
####Special Abilities  

Change Shape (Su) A royal naga can use this ability to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male human, and so on) and the naga can only use this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its dual gaze in humanoid form.

Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the effects of either gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga’s five faces are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and often weigh more than 750 pounds.

Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals.

&amp;#x200B;

So, due to my deep system mastery of Pathfinder, and my expertise in plumbing both AoN, d20pfsrd, and... ...Well, this place?

&amp;#x200B;

I've damn near become the co-DM of a game I'm playing. My current challenge is to design these soul-bound weapons, that're verging on Artifact-levels of power, or beyond.

&amp;#x200B;

The first two were easy. Our Samurai is getting a ""Mjolnir-Kanata"", which can do electrical shenanigans, and enables her to burn Resolve to pull off truly superhuman feats. Our Monk's getting a pair of Cestus which inherently increase his speed. Further, by staying in motion, and ""picking up speed"", he can build up to deliver huge, devastating blows. The amount of running around he has to do to ""spin up"" kinda telegraphs it, but, it's thematic, and it fits the DM's request for the weapon. ""Gloves that hit harder the faster you're going.""

&amp;#x200B;

And then... There's mine. Mine, and the Tiefling Magus'.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me get the easier one out of the way. The Magus'. The weapon, itself.

&amp;#x200B;

(Worth Noting: when I say ""weapon ability"", I'm talking as much about stuff like Corrosive Burst/Keen/Speed as I am Artifact Level Special Abilities.)

&amp;#x200B;

A ""vacuum-blade Katana"". As with the Cestus and Katana above, it's gonna have a slew of different powers. Which is something I'll need to do, myself. But, I don't even know how to begin rendering that, as a weapon. What powers are wind-based in Pathfidner,  that won't overlap with the Mjolnirtana?

&amp;#x200B;

Then, there's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the elements have made sense. The Samurai is quick to judge, swift to act, dealing devastating blows. Lightning. Our monk, besides being an Oread, is best known for (sometimes literally) barreling through challenges at breakneck speed. Thus, the weapon's themes of a ""rolling stone"". (It does Corrosive, because that's what Earth element is in Pathfinder.)

The Magus is a bit of a leap, but, given his all-consuming quest for vengeance, and the utter \*emptiness\* in him aside from that, a vacuum makes sense. A massive emptiness that only \*appears\* as wind, because it's sucking in everything to fill the void.

&amp;#x200B;

...My Alchemist, though...

&amp;#x200B;

I've been supposed both Fire, and Water, by the GM. My choice. But, I'm not sure how well those fit.

&amp;#x200B;

Thalen, thus far, has been characterized by his extreme snark in the face of peril, a calculating hands-off approach to battles, and the characteristic ""You never stopped to ask if you **should**"" mentality so common to Alchemists. There's almost nothing left, now, of the elf who began this journey. Above all else, though, was the pursuit of Infinity. Thalen's ultimate goal is to defeat Death Itself.

&amp;#x200B;

...I'm not even close to sure what ""elemental force"" could best represent that.

0,0,8,7,"So - after a year long hiatus I am going to get back into DMing with a fresh group. I had an idea for an opening scenario that will join the party together and from here I will get the ball rolling for the campaign proper. I, of course, would love feedback and ideas.

They are all in the course of traveling for non-committed reasons such as *rumors* of work (why they are will be determined through their back grounds which will be randomized). Each of them finds themselves in an truly awful storm and one by one I will have them see a light of a manor in the distance. As the first one approaches lightning will strike an old oak tree to the left of the house in the middle of a field. Inside the house a small funeral procession will be under way for a recently deceased noble woman. A dwarven mercenary stuffing his face at the buffet, a bitter countess, the recently deceased's loyal butler, a cleric of the Triumvirate (homebrew pantheon) and TBD other cast members.

Each and every one of them besides the butler has been lured there due to a promise of a part of her will. Each and every one of them the dead noble woman had a major axe to grind with. At the end of 60 rounds lightning will strike a device atop the house and finish a ritual that will raise a dozen TBD incorporeal undead from the basement which will proceed to slaughter anyone and everyone as the players will be level 1 at this point.

And then the players will suddenly be in front of the house - and lighting will strike an old oak tree in the center of a field to the left of the house.

I had planned that, should they not figure out how to stop it on the second loop, I would have the benefactor of this little hell; a demon with whom the Noble Woman made a pact with, will realize that something is off and come in to inspect. The addition of a new person suddenly would throw them off and he will be in human guise. He will in no way help them, of course.

- 2 Monk - MoMS: for style merging and evasion

- 4 Unchained Rogue - Scout: for charge Sneak Attack

- 13 Brawler - Winding Path Renegade/Steel-Breaker: Movement speed/Swift -&gt; free 6 AC


My build is focused on unarmed strikes using weapon finesse and finesse training to get my Kitsune Brawler to have Dex to DMG. Pummeling style lets me charge and dish out sneak attack damage regularly which is 2d6 per hit.

She is working with high Dex and Wis and 5 Str since with her monk dip she gets Dex to AC.

With Monk's Robes I can max out damage for unarmed strikes and I can take GTWF as a perma or a flex feat, so I have 2 options for my last level that I am torn between. DM ruled that since Brawler levels count as monk levels, I effectively have unarmed damage of a Lvl 15 monk.


Oracle:

- Powerless Prophecy Curse: Uncanny Dodge immediately and improved uncanny dodge at 19th level, +4 to initiative at 9th level. 

- Cantrips and LVL 1 spells

Possible Revelations:

- Cinder Dance: 10ft Movement Bonus

- Dual Cursed Archetype - Misfortune: Free re-rolls once per day and forced re-rolls on others.

- War Sight/Temporal Celerity - Advantage on Initiative checks which works well with the curse.

Negatives:

- Not full BAB


Bloodrager(Urban):

- Bloodline Power(Undead) Frightful Charger: Cause shaken for 1 round when I charge while bloodraging

- Controlled Bloodrage: No AC penalty, no will save bonus, and a +4 morale bonus to one physical stat during a rage

- Fast Movement: 10ft movement bonus

- Full BAB

Negatives:

- No spells

- No Uncanny Dodge


So that is where I am at. I have a few thoughts as listed below:

- Take 3 U.Rogue, abandon the sneak attack charge plan, take 2 levels of Bloodrager or 1 Bloodrager/1 Oracle (Max BAB of 18/17 respectively)

- Take Oracle because my Con is 12-14 as I am focusing on Wis/Dex for AC so I wont be able to rage often.

- Take Bloodrager because the rage is just for very situational events and the +1 to attack is lovely.

- Abandon Scout URogue, take 4 URogue, 13 Brawler, 3 Monk (Movement does not stack with WPR unless I flex into it with Monk Moves) for Lvl to CMB and Still Mind but I feel this is at a loss since I only need a total of 15 Brawler/Monk levels. This would be an option if I don't use WPR.


Any thoughts? I have been mulling over this for quite a while and would love second opinions.

0,0,9,8,"Hey, so I'm running a low-magic campaign set in the American west in 1901 (coincidentally the same year as RDR2, but I started the campaign before the trailer even dropped). So far, I've held pretty well to low-magic rules. Magic is a thing, but it's either small things or very rare. The group's encountered supernatural beings throughout, but it's magic on the same level as Indiana Jones rather than on the same level as Lord of the Rings or Skyrim like a regular campaign. 

So at the beginning of the campaign, I set forth some low magic rules. I audited the semi-magical classes I was allowing (like Druid) and nerfed some of their magic and gave them some other abilities to make up for it for balancing (like, druids don't maintain *Wild Shape* but they do get to use the *Wild Surge* ability from the Wilder class). At the beginning of the campaign when everyone was creating their characters, I told them don't plan on making a magical character unless you can give me a really good story reason for the character to be magical (ie. we have an alchemist who's basically a traveling snake oil salesman). 

So one of my PCs, the group's monk, recently left the group because his character ran out of motivation to continue the story and decided he wanted to retire (he was old anyways, and the player wanted to try out a different class). The player had already prepared a backup character, a rogue who specialized in breaking into places she didn't belong and fighting with a straightrazor (which is a really cool concept). The rogue also had an animal companion, a bulldog named Benji. This was a few weeks ago. 

Just this week, we got in our first big combat encounter with the rogue (I had actually posted here about two weeks ago looking for help building it). The rogue did just fine in the fight, but Benji wasn't much help and I think the player was disappointed by that. He's now asking me if he can take a level in the wizard class (which I had originally said was off limits) with a spell list that consists of spells I had approved for other classes (*Snowball, Summon Minor Monsters, Jump, Anticipate Peril, True Strike, Charm Person, Obscuring Mist*) in order to get access to Major Magic to gain access to making Benji a familiar at level 11 (which is coming up, we're level 9). On the one hand, this would make his dog much more durable in battle and much less likely to die. On the other hand, I already said wizard was off limits and having an additional combatant means I need to rescale my future combat encounters I have planned. 

Any advice as to what I should do? I'm considering making a trade and saying that Major Magic is no longer a requirement to make a familiar, but there's still the issue of combat scaling. I could also just hand-wave giving his dog the appropriate number of hit points for a creature of its size at his level.

0,0,6,3,"My PCs are going to be traveling northward through the Storval Plateau, and I'm going to have them run into one Qoah (Hawk, i think is the most southwestern territory) on their way up. This party is very, very interested in different cultures, so I'm trying to come up with a way to fill roughly 4 hours with almost straight role playing. Of course, this will be sensitive to other cultures, but I'm hoping to respectfully base them around native american traditions. I have the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1) The party has a bit of an encounter with a patrol of warriors and fights a champion. This is going to both introduce them to the very different combat style of the Shoanti as well as convey to them that the clan is on high-alert -- an omen of things to come. It will also be a good chance for them to opt not to take lethal measures while they try to resolve the situation.  


2) the fight will be interrupted by a clan elder who demonstrates a close tie to his horse (speed in getting there) and a druidic connection to nature with a lightning strike in the distance to grab their attention.   


3) The clan elder will invite them as guests into the clan's camp. This will be a prime time for players to interact with different cultural aspects of the Shoanti day to day life, and aside from observing crafts, I could use some help with actual activities that the party can partake in.   


4) By dinner time, the clan will entertain them with music and stories, eventually alluding to a big bad that the party is looking to slay. I'd love to share stories with them, but short of having them trade one story for another, I can't think of a way to get the party involved outside of just talking at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) In the morning, the clan will conduct a ceremony to bless the PCs on their journey to slay the evil thing which has a long legacy of plaguing the Shoanti. This will be another opportunity to show a different flavor of magic.   


All of that, I expect, could take from 1 to two hours. I really need help filling out the time with role playing opportunities.

Now, without further ado, let's talk about my party!

**The PCs**

Kiril: A young human Oracle hailing from the city of Katapesh, Kiril is a mysterious man touched by the goddess of death, Pharasma, and as a result spirits seem to follow him wherever he goes. He's a Chaotic Good Oracle with the Haunted curse and the Ancestor mystery, as well as Finding Haleen, Reactionary and Fate's Favoured as his traits, plus the Lonely drawback.

Polly Bonne: An Elf paladin from the Nightstalls of Katapesh, Polly is an earnest young woman with a keen eye for a good bargain and a firm sense of justice and fairness. She's Lawful Good, with the Knight of Coins archetype and the Missionary and Dustwalker Agent traits. As you might have guessed, she's a devout worshiper of Abadar and aims to restore order and civilisation to the village of Kelmarane.

Sheisho: An enigmatic Vishkanya vigilante of mysterious origin, Sheisho is quiet and inscrutable much of the time. She's (seemingly) Lawful Neutral, with the Serial Killer archetype and the poisonous slayer and desert child traits. Due to both her heritage and profession, she is an expert in the use of poisons and with her blades is able to use that expertise to deadly effect.

Amun'Setra: A cold, grizzled ranger from a dark, mysterious tribe located somewhere in the south of Osirion, Amun is a hard, dangerous man with a talent for killing and the ability to slip into most areas undedected. He's Neutral Evil, worships Set and has the Divine Tracker and Skirmisher Archetypes, as well as the Gnoll Killer and Bloodthirsty traits and although he seems to be human, there is a certain cold, unnatural aura about him. 

Thanna: A strong, beautiful Orc mesmerist who recently escaped captivity at the hands of her mercenary masters, Thanna is adept at using her wiles and her mystical abilities to get out of danger and has joined the expedition to Kelmarane primarily to earn her freedom, so that she can never be sent back to her masters. She's Chaotic Neutral, with the autohypnotist and dreamstalker archetypes and with the Charming, Earning Your Freedom and Tusked traits, plus Insatiable as a drawback.

Additionally, a sixth person was hired by the patrons of the party, but due to a night of heavy drinking this mysterious individual missed the camel caravan the rest of the party took to reach them. (Translation: One of my players was busy and couldn't make the first session.)

**The Session Begins**

The PCs had all been hired individually prior to the start of the campaign by Garavel, the major-domo of the merchant princess Almah, to help them retake the ruined village of Kelmarane from the tribe of gnolls that had occupied it. The adventure path itself is pretty vague about the circumstances around this hiring and how/why Garavel decided to hire the PCs and then piss off to his camp without them, but I figured it was a case of him meeting a bunch of applicants of varying quality/integrity a few weeks prior to the expedition and telling the ones who didn't seem *completely* insane where to find him (note that anybody signing up to participate in an expedition to retake a village from a tribe of gnolls in the service of the Carrion King is probably a *little* insane). 

Now, the session began with the party riding through the hills on a camel caravan as they neared Garavel's camp at the Sultan's Claw, this huge-ass tree shaped like a claw. As they topped the last rise and saw his camp, they saw that one of the wagons in the camp was on fire and that the fire was spreading to the Sultan's Claw itself. The PCs immediately sprung into action as Almah, the leader of the expedition, requested their help and then raced off to try and put out the fire. Sheisho, Kiril and Thanna went to try putting out the fire, while Polly spent the entire encounter struggling to pull another wagon away from the one that was on fire and Amun similarly spent most of the time failing to stabilise a dying mercenary. Fortunately, the players were highly efficient in putting out the fire, with Sheisho deciding it was the best idea in the world to try dual-wielding buckets. And it worked. The fire was extinguished before it could spread and after a few rounds of Amun consistently failing his heal checks to stabilise the mercenary, Thanna took a break from yeeting water at the fire to help. With the combined efforts of Amun, Thanna and the camp's priest, they saved the mercenary. Oh also there were a bunch of animals running amok that had been freed from their pens somehow and while the module called for handle animal checks to round them up, Thanna's player said words to the effect of ""lol no"" and used the slumber hex to put the various goats and chickens to sleep.

With the fire put out and the animals in their pens, Almah and Garavel took the PCs aside. Almah explained that she suspected arson and, as the PCs weren't present when the fire started (and thus couldn't have set it), they would be tasked with investigating. She left them with Garavel, who (after some prodding) admitted that he suspected the camp's resident tracker and gnoll expert, Dashki, was responsible. Then, Garavel followed after Almah to the command tent and the PCs were let loose to explore the camp and interview its residents. 

Amun, Kiril and Sheisho traveled to the immolated wagon to investigate it, while Thanna and Polly decided to first interview the caravan drivers. As the former group examined the burnt out wagon, they noticed a greasy, disheveled looking man watching them from behind a rock. They called out to him and he walked off in a hurry, prompting them to follow and call out again. Thanna and Polly were distracted from the caravan drivers and rejoined the rest of the party, cornering this man and asking him his name. When they realised it was Dashki, they swiftly accused him of having set the fire. He denied any involvement in the fire, to which Thanna responded with the spell Implant Urge, implanting within Dashki the urge to be honest. He continued to profess his innocence, admitting that he was spying on Almah when the fire was set and claiming that pugwampis were probably responsible for the fire. Amun returned to the wagon to investigate, discovering tiny tracks around it. Then, he went to the animal pen and found similar tracks, which lent some credibility to Dashki's claims. Polly, deciding to mess with the tracker a little (and also trying to discourage further spying), declared Dashki a pervert and then flipped a coin, declaring that if it landed as heads then she would believe Dashki. Once the other players and I stopped referencing The Dark Knight and No Country for Old Men, Polly did so and while it came up with tails, she just narrowed her eyes and said ""I believe you for now."" After a quick discussion with the caravan drivers in which they learned that the prized goat of the husband had gone missing in the chaos, they returned to Almah and Garavel to report their findings.

With a new suspect in the setting of the fire, Almah ordered the PCs to follow the tracks with Dashki and, if possible, bring back the pugwampi. And so they followed the tracks, noticing signs that a small animal had been dragged away from the pens. Before traveling any distance, Thanna made sure to cast prestidigation on Dashki to clean him off and make his stench bearable, after which they got moving. As they went, they cast light spells to illuminate the dark path as the sun set, noticing freaky shadows and hearing sounds in the distance as they passed by increasingly frequent cacti. Eventually they heard the bleating of a goat as they came to the edge of a dense thicket of cacti, so thick that they would need to move carefully to avoid being pricked. As they arrived, I explained how they felt a sense of dread and impending doom, and that they could see an injured goat tied up on the other side of the thicket by a shallow ravine. With a job to be done right in front of them, Kiril, Amun and Sheisho rolled up their sleeves and started to wade through the cacti, making periodic acrobatics checks as they went. As they made their first checks, with the most shit-eating grin you will ever see I asked them to roll twice and pick the lower results. When we came to Thanna and Polly (whose players had experiences with pugwampis in previous games), they just nope'd right the fuck out of it, standing still at the edge of the thicket with Dashki, watching as the other three tripped, stumbled and cursed their way through the thicket. Once they had made it through minus a few hit points each, they approached the goat, who promptly freaked the fuck out. Since he was tied off at the edge of a ravine, with a huge cactus jutting out from the wall just below him, this was pretty dangerous. So Thanna just pointed at the goat and put it to sleep, allowing Kiril to untie it with ease. As he did so, an outraged pugwampi emerged from behind a rock in the cactus thicket and started shooting pathetic tiny arrows at the PCs. Kiril and Sheisho ran into the thicket and after tripping a few times while the other party members proved completely ineffectual at engaging it from a distance, they managed to kill the gremlin.

With the goat and the dead pugwampi, the PCs returned to camp and presented the corpse to Almah and Garavel. With the mystery solved and Dashki's name cleared, the gnoll expert claimed the dead pugwampi as a trophy and hung it from his walking staff. With that, Almah sat the PCs down to discuss the terms of their employment - she offered them 200 gold apiece for their part in retaking the village of Kelmarane. The players happily accepted this sum, at which point Almah ordered them to go and clear out the nearby abandoned monastery to serve as a new base of operations, seeing as how the Sultan's Claw was too exposed. The players agreed and the following morning set off.

Once they reached the monastery, they decided that they would clear it out room by room rather than heading straight for the main chapel right away. Thus, they swept through the rooms swiftly - they killed four pugwampis in the kitchen, then battled with five baboons and a pair of wandering pugwampis before finding themselves in the dormitories of the monastery. In the neighbouring tower, Amun gazed up and noticed something furry poking out from a nook in the wall high up. His immediate reaction was to try shooting it, as is reasonable.  Unfortunately he missed and wrecked his arrow. Then, Kiril attempted to move the furry thing with Mage Hand, but to no avail as it was too big. So Thanna attempted to use her Slumber ability on whatever it was. It failed. With that, Amun picked up a rock and threw it as hard as he could against the wall next to the nook. That seemed to catch the furry thing's attention, as it immediately retreated further into the nook, disappearing from sight. The players decided it was probably nothing and went down the nearby stairs to explore the crypts below the monastery.

They emerged in a large laboratory and spread out to search the place. Kiril and Polly approached a pair of dirty glass containers filled with a luminescent green liquid crusted with mold. Kiril noticed it was quivering a little. Then it attacked them. The rest of the party raced in to help them pretty quickly and destroyed the oozes in short order, but not before one of them managed to scratch Polly up a little. At first this didn't seem like a big deal, but after they finished exploring the crypts, they came across a courtyard and Polly felt a sudden urge to dig. Amun came to help dig with her, while Sheisho searched the courtyard for treasure and found three immense bird eggs. While she was a little worried about that, she still kept the eggs. Meanwhile, Polly and Amun kept digging until suddenly, Polly cut open her hand on a blade. The pair dug around it and Polly pulled free a glittering longsword that felt perfectly balanced (as all things should be) in Polly's hands. Despite having never seen the sword before in her life, Polly knew its name - Tempest - and that it belonged to her. 

With this new acquisition, the party proceeded deeper into the monastery. They entered a shrine to a mysterious saint and once they had killed the stirges inhabiting the room (but not before Sheisho was drained of a few points of Con), they examined the shrine. Kiril, with the help of the spirits accompanying him, recognised the shrine as being devoted to an obscure regional saint known as Vardishal - a name Sheisho had read while skimming through a book she had picked up in the monastery's library earlier. The name was oddly familiar to Polly as well - almost as if she felt that it was *her* name. Intrigued by this information, Kiril and Sheisho read through the book that she had picked up. Upon more detailed examination (and a couple of *really* high knowledge rolls) Kiril was able to piece together that Vardishal was one of an order of five Jann warriors in service to the genie Nefeshti, known as the Templar of Five Winds. The Templars supposedly did battle with many of the spawn of Rovagug and are regarded as folk heroes of sorts in the region, known for both their names and the legendary weapons they carried: The ruthless Davashuum, wielder of a quarterstaff, the wise and wordly Kardswann who wielded an elaborate greataxe, Pazhvann, the spiritual man wielding a tremendous burning flail, the canny Zayifid, wielder of a deadly but elegant scimitar, and of course the legendary saint of Sarenrae, Vardishal - who was famed for both his skill at arms, and for his weapon - the longsword Tempest.

As Kiril explained this information to the party, they felt a sense of apprehension - while none had ever heard of the Templars of the Five Winds before, they *had* heard of a man named Kardswann - Kardswann was supposedly a man of immense power who had recently taken over the Kulldis tribe of Gnolls and reopened the battle market of Kelmarane as a haven for thieves, murderers and scoundrels across Katapesh. While he may have once been a hero, he was now their enemy - and upon hearing this, Polly was overcome with a sense of betrayal, of disappointment. As the party discussed this information, Amun proposed taking whatever valuables they could and fleeing as far as possible - he had signed up to fight gnolls, not to battle a legendary Jann hero. Polly refused - she needed to find out what these strange feelings meant, to learn the history behind her new blade. Kiril agreed that they should continue - he wanted only to find his sister and he had it on good authority that she was in Kelmarane. Thanna for her part needed to help liberate Kelmarane so that she could go free and Sheisho was not yet ready to give up a 200 gold reward. Reluctantly Amun agreed to continue their mission and for the moment, the party put aside any thoughts of the future, as their job was not yet done. They had swept through most of the monastery, but the chapel still remained - after a moment's rest, they steeled themselves for this final task and set off for the chapel.

0,0,8,0,"I'm considering a character concept where he is completely non magical. The game is a gestalt game, we roll for stats, gm says roll til you have a set with an 18 but stick with that set. I've managed to roll up the best stat spread I've ever seen, and I'm going to take it and challenge myself. The stats in question are 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 14. On a normal character these stats would be game breaking and open up some crazy MAD builds, and may very well still; we'll see.

Other relevant info: using hero points (I'll be going antihero most likely), and background skills. Level five start, gm said we'll be going til the late teens.

This character will be completely devoid of magic. I'm taking this to its farthest possible extreme; if an antimagic field would cancel it out, I'm not using it. That means no spells, no spell like abilities, no magic items, and no supernatural abilities. I'm going completely for a badass normal type of character. This limits me to fighter, brawler, barbarian, cavalier, gunslinger (emerging guns), samurai, rogue, slayer, and swashbuckler.

0,0,20,2,"So my friends and I are about to play some E6. That means our characters will only be level and then instead of leveling you get feats. So only level 6 class abilities, but the ability to build some different feat chains.

It will be a 25 point buy and I was thinking on making a Desna worshiping Tempered champion paladin. Because it seems like a build that can work with a few feats, but you can continue to upgrade it for a long time. I have seen people online say that you can't be a paladin of desna because of allignment, but as far as I can see that is only in pathfinder society, as only clerics have worship restrictions based on allignment.

So I have been thinking on going human. Mostly because I haven't made a human for a long time. Go with a stat array like this:

str: 10 dex: 15 con: 15 int: 10 wis: 10 cha:17(+2)

Take Fey Foundling and Way of the shooting star as lvl 1 feats and then I have a flexible and rather strong basic build that allows me to do a number of different things.

**Standard sword and board**

By putting on heavy armour and a shield(Maybe a buckler) this is like a standard sword and board build, with slightly better healing and saves, but slightly lower damagde at the early levels. Being a tempered champion means that the star knifes will deal d6 damagde at lvl 4 and d8 damagde at lvl 6. Smite will give more ac than normal because of the high charisma, but less offensive, because I am already getting + charisma to hit.

*Items:*

*Feats:*

Weapon focus (Star Knife), weapon specialization(Star knife)

**Duel wielding**

With a belt of dexterity +2, the paladin will be able to get improved two weapon fighting. Reading way of the shooting star it seems like the paladin will get full charisma to damadge with off hand weapon and if I carry a buckler then I can shift betwen sword and board and dual wielding depending on the combat situation.

*Items:*

+2 dex item

*Feats:*

Two weapon fighting, improved two weapon fighting.

**Edited in Combining dual wield and sword and board**

An enchanted buckler can give quiet a bit of ac. With these two feats and a +2 buckler I would get +4 ac, while only taking -1 to hit with my buckler hand attacks.

*items:*

+2 buckler

*feats:*

Shield Focus, Unhindering Shield 

**Thrown weapon**

It is often good to have a backup ranged weapon, but being able to do ranged damagde might also increase the paladins damagde in some situation where he would instead have to move over to his enemies and thus can't full attack.

*Items:*

Blinkback Belt(2500 gold)

*Feats:*

Quick draw, Point blank shoot, Precise Shot, Rapid shot.

**Animal companion**

Temepered chamion doesn't get a mount and animal companions are always great. It owuld be nice to get an ape or something that the paladin can ride inside a dungeon, but the only feat I know that give an animal companion is Animal ally.

*Feats:*

Nature soul, Animal ally

**Other good feats:**

Extra lay on hands, for more healing and to power divine bond.

**Other good items:**

Mithrial full plate, to make full use of the high dex.

Are there other great items, feats, feat lines or traits that I should be aware off?",Pathfinder_RPG,E6 Starknife paladin

All of these messages are written as though they occur over the course of a night at most with the final message occurring as they leave. Additionally the conclusion of the section of the book describes the events as though the PCs emerge in early morning.

0,0,11,17,"#[Psychic Lich](https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Psychic%20Lich)  
####Appearance  


This gaunt, ghoulish figure’s skin is inscribed with faintly glowing runes. Short-lived afterimages trail behind it.

####CR   12
#####Alignment:  LE
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Special Attacks: A psychic lich gains the special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the lich’s HD + the lich’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.

Bewildering Touch (Su): Any living creature a psychic lich hits with its touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently confused as its nervous system continuously sends false signals. The creature doesn’t automatically attack the psychic lich if it is targeted by further attacks. Calm emotions or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description) with a DC equal to the bewildering touch’s save DC. As a full-round action, a creature that rolls a result of “act normally” can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect.

Psychic Feast (Ex): If a psychic lich succeeds at a Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, it instead avoids the effect entirely. If the effect was a spell with the mind-affecting descriptor, the psychic lich also heals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus the spell’s caster level if it succeeds at its save. A psychic lich may automatically succeed on any Will save against a spell it casts that targets only itself.

Rejuvenation (Su): When a psychic lich is destroyed, its body reforms near its astral memoir 10d10 days later. If a creature reads the psychic lich’s memoir, the total time is reduced to one tenth the original result, which could result in the psychic lich’s immediate restoration in a new body. Once the time elapses, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body).

The only way to ensure that a psychic lich does not rejuvenate is to target its memoir with the spell instigate psychic duelOA or mindscape doorOA or use it as a special focus when casting plane shift or similar magic. This allows one creature to instigate a psychic duel (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 202) on a veiled, harmful mindscape with a self-contained shape inhabited by the lich’s astral legend. The legend has the statistics of the lich, can’t leave the mindscape by any means, and is permanently destroyed if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. An astral legend can’t be destroyed unless the psychic lich’s physical body has also been destroyed and has not yet rejuvenated.

Weaknesses: A psychic lich doesn’t gain immunity to mind-affecting effects as a result of becoming undead. If the base creature is immune to any mind-affecting effects, it loses those immunities and instead gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against such effects.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

To become a psychic lich, one must create and infuse a memoir, which serves a similar function to an ordinary lich’s phylactery. This memoir projects the lich’s personal legend into the Astral Plane, which is tethered through the planes to a physical object, typically a magically strengthened book or scroll (10 hit points, hardness 1, break DC 15). The only way to destroy the lich is to destroy his astral legend, which almost always requires the memoir as a special focus. Unless the astral legend is erased, the lich can rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Psychic Lich, below).

Each psychic lich must create its own memoir by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast psychic spells at a caster level of 11th or higher. The memoir costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.

If the physical memoir is destroyed while the psychic lich’s astral legend survives, the physical memoir gradually reforms over the course of 1d10 days at a site central to its creator’s history (such as the library where he first studied magic or the battlefield where he vanquished a powerful rival). It typically reappears hidden among other books or treasures, where an unwitting dupe might begin reading the text and hasten the psychic lich’s return.

0,0,4,27,"So, my main group is myself and some friends from university meeting up every few months for a whole weekend to do a marathon session. We have to do this as the group is pretty scattered (I'm in Northern England, one's in the far south, 3 in the Midlands but still in different counties). We entertained the idea of online play but we are kind of dragging our feet with that one at the moment for various reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last session we had was the end of the campaign I ran as DM and that was October 2018. 

I haven't played since then but then spent the next few months creating a new character with the help of many people from this sub in preparation for the next campaign (someone else is taking over as DM, we have been rotating). 

I was getting super anxious to start and I was curbing it by creating multiple back-up characters. Eventually, even that activity started to stale and so I resolved to start and GM my own group in my area so I can do shorter, more frequent sessions in between my main group's sessions. I was able to gather up a small group and I left them to plan their characters. Unfortunately, that's taken some time as well and so I again started getting anxious to play. 

&amp;#x200B;

I even bought a brand new set of dice, bought the beginner box for the group I'm running, and prepared various apps to use in both groups and I was really starting to get bummed out at the delays. But now, we are finally solidifying our plans and I'm getting so hyped!

&amp;#x200B;

My main group is starting a PFS adventure but not using PFS rules. Our current planned start date is first week of April and I'm finally gonna be able to use my Dhampir Investigator!

&amp;#x200B;

My new group will be starting next weekend and I plan to run them through the Beginner Box adventure and transition into Rise of the Rune Lords! The part currently consists of a Druid with a warcat companion, a warpriest, a sorcerer, and a wizard! I think the warpriest is concerned that they are all casters so he is thinking of changing his character.

0,0,14,3,"Essentially, looking to make a build, and looking for help/tips on optimizing it, but don't actually have a game in which to use the build. Thus, can't really rely on cheese strats, or interpreting things certain ways, or obscure unbalanced stuff. I'd like to build an [Eldritch Archer](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Magus%20Eldritch%20Archer) Magus, and while [Kurald's Guide to the Magus](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?423754-Myrrh-Frankincense-and-Steel-Kurald-Galain-s-Guide-to-the-Magus) is very nice, it doesn't elaborate much on how to build a bow or gun wielder (nor would i necessarily expect it to).

As a quick note, i'm spoilering my own extra comments/opinions to hopefully make the questions less, uh, full of tangents. i'm also fairly new to Pathfinder itself, having gone through chargen once or twice but never having the opportunity to actually play.

Edits: I'm in the middle of tossing useful links into the text. Though, as the post just got removed until i Flair it, it's not like you'll notice a difference :p

Edit 2: Done \^

So:

\-What feats/[Arcana](https://aonprd.com/MagusArcana.aspx) would be essential to an Eldritch Archer?

\-What order would i be looking to take them in?

\-[Hexcrafter](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Magus%20Hexcrafter), [BeastBlade](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Magus%20Beastblade), or neither? (They stack with Eld. Archer, but not eachother)

&amp;#x200B;

Eldritch Archers get a bonded item like Wizards do, albeit it can only be a ranged weapon.

\-Would a gun or a bow be better, and what unwritten limitations would there be to choosing my weapon? (For example, could i take a Composite Longbow with a full +5 strength modifier as my bonded weapon, assuming i had enough strength to wield it?)

\-It's Masterwork by default, but can it be upgraded into a Magic weapon later? What levels could i expect to start upgrading it, if so? I'd assume a Masterwork weapon would fall off in usefulness later, even with Magus's arcane pool and temporary weapon enchantments. &gt;!(which also seems quite inefficient on a Masterwork weapon, since there always needs to be that +1 enhancement bonus that doesn't stack with Masterwork's bonus, before you can actually start adding properties)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who doesn't mind trading a *bit* of optimization for crafting &gt;!(to make equipment optimization a bit less GM dependent, and to further support my party; the Magus seems pretty good at both debuffs and battlefield control, it's just a shame Eld. Archer can't make good use of Frostbite until 9th level where an Arcana finally lets me tack the Touch spells Magus is known for onto my ranged attacks)!&lt;, what should i look for in terms of Feats/Race/Etc, and when should i take them? &gt;!(The !&lt;[Aphorite](https://aonprd.com/RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aphorite)&gt;! race actually looks really, really nice for a Composite Bow based Eld. Archer Magus who does a bit of crafting on the side)!&lt;

0,0,36,17,"I've been DMing for almost a year now, and while I've got a decent grasp of the very intricate Pathfinder rules (or at least know how to look them up quickly) I feel like I'm missing some basics because I have only been playing tabletop RPGs for less than 2 years. So here are some more basic RPG questions that I hope you can help me with:

1. Situation: party is walking down a road, enemies are standing in the middle of the road. How do you determine if there is a surprise round? The enemy and the party are both not sneaking, but it could happen that the party or the enemy is very loud or has a bright light for example, meaning the other would get a chance to hide in real life. In the game, this means I would give either the party or the enemy a bonus to Perception, but the Perception skill mentions that it should be used against Stealth, which does not apply yet as they are not hiding yet. **How do you determine if someone gets the opportunity to hide? And also: how far away should the enemy be if no one is surprised?**
2. Flow between exploring and battle. Let's say I've planned an encounter while the party is travelling, for example: when the party arrives at river X they could notice the entrance to a dungeon on the river shore if they explore a bit. The party is doing their exploration stuff like buying gear in the town, getting their horses, etc., and then they start travelling. **Do I just fastforward until they are at the river? Do I describe the scenery along the whole way and wait for them to tell me if they want to take a closer look at something? Since most encounters are battles, if I 'stop the fastforward' they will usually prepare for battle, but is this something I should try to avoid?**
3. Traps. One of my players likes to roll perception everytime he enters a room, but does not tell me what his character is doing (just looking around for anything unusual I guess). Another player does the opposite, he describes that his character is looking around an area for anything unusual, but does not roll until I tell him to. **If the only thing they can find are traps, do I let them roll for Perception if they don't mention the traps? If they do mention they want to look for traps but there is only a secret door, do I let them roll for Perception to detect the door? If they don't mention anything but they do enter a room with a trap, do I give them a hint by saying 'the floor looks different here' or something like that?**
4. Sense motive. **Do I let the players roll Sense Motive if they ask for it but the NPC is actually not lying? And for the opposite case: the PC is not lying but the truth is very hard to believe, do I let the NPC roll for Sense Motive or not? And if an NPC is lying but the player does not suspect it, yet I feel the character might get a suspicion, do I help the player by telling them to roll for Sense Motive or do I give a hint like '\[character name\] finds this suspicious'?**
5. Knowledge checks. **If an unknown monster comes up, and the players tell me they want to figure out what it is, should I tell them 'roll for Knowledge Religion' if it is an undead monster but they don't know that it is and haven't told me they want to know whether it's undead?** Telling the players which Knowledge check to roll already gives a lot of information.

If you could only answer one question that would be great already. Thanks for your time.

0,0,194,949,"There is ages old argument that necromancers would be pretty much good choice of local lord. Basically, you live with all the comfort aviable, but your corpse is reanimated upon your death, and made to work the fields, clean the streets, or whatever necessary. I came across one of the reposts of this proposition recently, and thought..what about vampires?

Now, I know what you are thinking. Vampires are evil. They are parasites. There is no way for them to be redeemable.

So, give me a second.

In pseudo-medieval setting D&amp;D is designed around, taxes are mainly paid in form of food to the table of the lord. Either directly (i.e. you surrender part of your crops) or indirectly (you work on your lord's field, in addition to the field you own. What grows on your field goes to you, the lord's field produce goes to them). Or you could pay money to the lord instead, but most common folk didn't really have enough money to do that.

So, what happens when we change the lord with a vampire?

The lord needs common food no longer, hence all the crops fall to the peasants, making them better fed, and thus healthier. The vampire needs blood. Now, since MM doesn't specify how much or how frequently, I'm going to go with 1 human worth of blood per month in total (i.e. multiple people can be sucked for less, but still the same grand total), minimum. That leaves us with about 5 liters (or about 1.2 gallons) of blood.

With 30 villages, this gives us less then a glass of blood per village. So, each month, instead of crops, each village will send a single member to the vampire. The vampire takes bit of blood, leaving the villager bit dizzy, but otherwise ok. Given each village has around 100 people, or more, each donor will only have to go once in few years. And they will recover much sooner, thanks to being well fed.

In addition to decrease in the costs to maintain a lord, i bumps up the defensibility of the domain., given all the vampire abilities. And if army is needed, the soldiers recruited from the area will be better fed, healthier, and possibly better equiped thanks to surplus, then any invading army.

The vampire gets voluntary donors of blood, meaning higher survivability for him as well. They might be evil by nature of the curse, but they are lawful evil. And thus will uphold his promise to not take more then necessary.

Granted, it's not really that great of a model for larger realms, but for a small mountain county? Seems good to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDITS AND CLARIFICATIONS:**

1) Many of you pointed out that taxes are here to pay for more then lord's sustenance. To answer the most commonly brought up topics:

* **Army:** Some point out that money are needed to maintain an army. What they seem to forget is medieval lords didn't maintain large standing army. Maybe 1 guard per 500 peasants, if that. If army was needed, peasants were rounded up and armed by simple weaponary. One vampire is combat force equivalent of at least 10 trained soldiers, with fraction of the cost to sustain them. 
* **Upkeep of roads:** That is something the peasants are expected to do for free. Alternatively, if our vampire lord is coupled with necromancer, it could be done by zombies.
* **Trade:** In medieval times, trade was fully withing the rights of the serfs. Lords just collected taxes from the trade.
* **Law&amp; order**: see first bullet point.

2) ""Vampires are evil. If one got to rule country, they wouldn't restrain themselves to eat just once a month. ""

Vampires are *Lawful* evil. They can make bargains, and will hold to them. And then can restrain themselves, if it's more beneficial for them then not restraining. And, the strategy mentioned above is more beneficial to them then sucking people dry.

3) ""Vampires are dark and twisted, and the land they dwell in rots and is infested with wolves and plague""

Vampires are obsessive over the topic they lived for. While Strahd was all about causing suffering to others, and finding the girl again and again, he was kinda asshole in his life. A peaceful bookworm type noble would probably just turn into very obsessive book collector, that need to have copy of every book in his library, and won't allow anybody to go inside the library. In essence, he will become the librarian from  *The Name of the Rose* .  Paladin that always did the best for the people will still do *what's best for the people*.

As far as regional effects go..plants wither and die, sure, but only in 100 ft around the lair of the vampire. Not the whole region. Just 100 ft. around the lair. In other words, it won't even cross the lord's castle's walls. Not a word about plague. There is bit more rodents in the are, true, but that just means more cats will be bred. 

4) I fully acknowledge it wouldn't really work with larger country, like, let's say Roman Empire. That being said, smaller country, like barony, or county at most, especially on the outskirts of civilization, or in mountains, shouldn't really have be that much of a problem.",dndnext_test,Why vampire overlord is preferable alternative to taxes

0,0,85,94,"So I've wanted to make a berserker character that fights with two handaxes (basically, Olaf from League of Legends). However, I realized when reading the description of Frenzy that they are incompatible:

&gt; Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack ***as a bonus action*** on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

The extra attack requires a bonus action, which means dual wielding is essentially pointless while in a frenzy. The thing is, I have no idea why it's worded the way it is. A 2 handed weapon like a greatsword benefits MUCH more from the second attack than a light weapon like a handaxe (+7 compared to +3.5), so it's not like two weapon fighting while frenzied would be stronger - it'd actually be significantly weaker.

I've been talking to my DM about changing Frenzy to something like the following to permit a two weapon fighting barbarian:
 
&gt; Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single ***additional melee weapon attack when you take the attack action, once*** on each of your turns after this one.

So I'm sitting here at work the day after my group's weekly session, and I can't stop thinking about how amazing the showdown with Acerak was last night, and we haven't finished it yet!

First, our party consists of a Human Grave Domain Cleric, a Gnome Evocation Wizard, a Tabaxi Shadow Monk, and me, a Human Bear Totem Barbarian. We had a near TPK at the beginning that only my Barb survived, but this party has made it through Omu and the Tomb together without any casualties on our end. All this to say that we as players and characters are very invested in stopping the Soul Monger and Acerak.

Now the actual encounter was very well constructed, and I'm not sure if that is more to WoTC or our DM's credit. Either way, it was hands down the best encounter I've ever played.  The arena is great. There's a huge pit of lava you have to deal with, or, as in our case, use to your advantage. There's also several platforms and struts that you can jump to or move across in case you lose flight, as we did. There are minions and waves to the encounter, at least that's how it played for us.

The Atropal went down fairly quickly, but its Wail was super scary. Exhaustion is such an underused mechanic and gaining a level each round was terrifying. Our Cleric had to Greater Restoration herself to avoid the disadvantage on Saves.  We also managed to Fear the Sewn Sisters away, so we had a bit of a premature celebration. Then Acerak arrived for our mostly full capacity group of level 12 adventurers. He was a bastard. 

Acerak was a great final confrontation. Our strategy broke down to me grappling him and tossing him into the lava, and when he teleported out our Monk beat the snot out of him with her Staff of Striking. Our Wizard kept Counterspelling whatever spells she could while trying to crowd control the room. She cast Scatter for the first time in what was one of the best moments of the fight getting our Cleric away from a Giant-Ape-Polymorphed Night Hag and a Specter. 

Our Grave Cleric kept canceling Crits and using Mass Healing Word in the last stage of the fight. She also used a Path to the Grave on the Atropal which is what allowed us to finish it off so quickly.

It was an intense fight, and it lasted for **SEVEN** rounds before we finished Acerak, which is crazy since most fights, in my experience at least, last 3-4 rounds at most. I started worrying, before I clotheslined Acerak into the lava for the last time, that my Rage would end leaving me defenseless for a round. 

We finally called it a night after Acerak died, and the Monk got the Wizard back up with a healing potion. However, the hags finally made their Wis save against the Wand of Fear and are heading back. We took stock last night after the session, and our Cleric is at 1hp, I'm at 3, the Wizard has 8 from the potion, and our Monk is almost out of Ki and barely in the double digits HPwise. 

We killed the ancient Lich Acerak, but we may fall to the Sewn Sisters as they're still Polymorphed into Giant Apes. Our fate will be decided next Wednesday at 6:45 CST, and I can't wait!

My one player, a Tiefling Warlock searching for his lost brother, came across his powers through a pact with Baphomet. Baphomet has now come back to him, explaining that the powers aren't for free and that he needs to start fulfilling his end of the bargain.   


My player loved the idea. My thought process is that Baphomet hands him ""side quests"" or objectives that can be completed within the confines of the session being played; if the player completes said side quest, he is reward with a bit of bonus XP, whereas if he fails... well - I haven't figured that out yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I built it as if I was starting a campaign with a level 11 character so he has 2 rare magic items and 1 uncommon magic item. Longsword+2, Studded leather+1 and stone of good luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so the breakdown of what I built and why I chose certain things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Race, Scourge Aasimar - Maia are about as close to angels/devils as you get in the TOlkien universe, you see that represented most clearly by Balrogs and Sauron who all are Maiar. I picked scourge because of the racial feat. Radiant Consumption sounds a lot like some of the things Gandalf did to use light to harm Orcs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Class - Storm Sorcerer 5/Hexblade Warlock 5.  - Hexblade is self explanatory. Storm sorcerer was where I struggled. Metagaming Dragon ancestry would be the way to go because of that boost to AC and HP. But Gandalf showed no elemental resistance. Wild Magic works to a point but it's more Tom Bombadil. Storm and Divine were where I settled. I went with storm to use that gust of wind escape as a flourish. Bummer is that he gains elemental protection later but I just kind of live with it. 

  
Hexblade took pact of the blade, again for more thematic than anything. Pact of the Tome also would work really well. I did this for thirsting blade though. Invocations are Agonizing blast (attack from afar) Misty Visions, and Thirsting blade. This character has a lot of spells, For cantrips I mainly went with thematic ones. EB for damage of course.

Lots of great opportunities for damage. I thought about instead of Warlock going Paladin. But I think for flavor in this build I wanted to go Warlock for a more potent caster. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some other stats 

&amp;#x200B;

Stats - STR 7 (woo bad roll) Dex 18 CON 18 INT 14 WIS 15 CHR 20

AC 17

Proficiency in Arcana, Intimidation, Insight, and Perception. WIsh he had performance as well but it's ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I said I also worked on a Paladin/Sorcerer build, it's actually mostly the same build, thematic difference is dump in Dex for STR which means I require a slight tweak where he needs some mithril chain or something instead. But I prefer this build for thematic purposes. 4 times quicken fireball baybeee (convert 3 1st level spell slots to Sorcery points, or to be mean, convert both your pact slots into SP then short rest) Can you imagine the carnage of having your Radiant Consumption  active hexblade's curse you get 2 attacks (+11 to hit 1d10+7) so assume both hit you're looking at a decent amount of damage (add 4 damage per attack plus 10 once) so you're looking at 12.5+12.5+8+10 so 43 damage which is pretty healthy. But then hey look a horde of enemies somewhere over there, Boom Quicken spell fireball or boom quicken Scorcher, or when you hit level 7 as a sorcerer, boom blight. So assume you have a group of enemies you can deal some damage to say a group of 4, you're looking at dealing 100+damage in a round. ",dndnext_test,Build idea for a Gandalf type of character

After the Revised Artificer from WotC came out some time ago and didn't quite deliver on what I hoped for, I saw this Homebrew op up quite often. So after some reluctancy (25 pages?!) I looked into it a bit and was pleasantly suprised. It has a whole lot of possibilities without stepping on the toes of the DM with magical Items. That was what I disliked most about the UA-Artificer.

Now after taking some days to read all of it, I am considering to allow it in my campaigns as well, if it comes up. But it is a whole lot of work to balance check it all, which is why I wanted to ask for the opinion of the hive mind:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a DM who is a real stickler for the rules, but a fantastic DM. I am currently a level 4 wizard with a rat familiar (named Gerald, he's great) and I am facing the problem of AOE spells. Burning hands drops and my rat on my shoulder instantly dies. I want to stop that. Obviously there is the option to dismiss him as an action, but I would rather not spend my first round of combat doing that. Further the rat isn't always capable of running away and hiding on his own. Talking to DM is also obviously an option, but if there was a Rules based way of doing it I know he'd be much happier!

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to keep the rat on my person and safe?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I put him in my backpack or bag of holding for the fight, would he be safe from AOE's there? I know that AOE's like burning hands don't ignite items which are worn but would that protect the rat from AOE?

So after...5 months?  Jesus that took forever.  Whatever, the point is we finally wrapped that side story up so I figured I'd give you all some closure.  I recommend reading the previous story because there's going to be a lot of context I'm not going to go over because I'm lazy.  But to sum it up, the party went bar hopping with the Imperial Family of the largest empire on the planet and the family's kickass bodyguards.  This lead to some romantic tensions, wacky hijinks, bar fights, and one bodyguard getting arrested for allegedly committing murder.  Here we go.

The story picks up right where we left off: the party and the Imperial Family book it to the prison to learn about what happened to their good friend Rowena.  Rowena reveals that thanks to all the booze she had the previous night she can barely remember what happened after the bar brawl.  All she remembers is standing in an alley over a halfling corpse, her axe coated in blood as the City Watch arrested her.  The emperor wants to simply pardon her right there and then but Rowena refuses because 1). That would be an admission of guilt and she doesn't know if she did or not and, if she did she wants to face the consequences, and 2). The halfling was a respected defense attorney named Harmon Longfoot.  If the emperor pardons her for the crime, then he admits Rowena murdered a respectable man.  And in a time of war, having a ruler do such blatant power abuse wouldn't sit well with the populace.  So the imperial family begin to make preparations for the trial set to happen in a few days, which I don't think is how law works but this is medieval times and everything I know about law comes from Phoenix Wright so y'all gotta learn to deal.

The party had about three days before the trial so they had time to investigate matters themselves.  They also learned that Rasha had been put on probation thanks to her actions the previous night so she decided to help with the investigation.  I had like two weeks between the last session and this one so I managed to prep a ton of locations each with one or two clues to move the investigation along.  I tried to make it so it could be done in any order and I feel I more or less succeeded.  I also wrote up a trial scene in the style of Phoenix Wright with witnesses and testimonies.  I had a plan and like all plans they failed after contact with the enemy- I mean players.

**Investigations**

First, our furry arcane trickster Wyld went to go talk with a contact of his in the city, a spy running a carpenter's guild to gain intel on the city.  The contact told Wyld about the various criminal factions, mentioning a new one that had popped up a few months back- an individual known only as the Blackguard.  Not much was known about them other than they operated in the poorer districts of the city.   Meanwhile the rest of the party met up at the city library to meet the lawyer and work out a defense for Rowena's trial.  Back with Wyld, the rogue investigated the crime scene.  He had to do so in secret since the Watch didn't want civilians at the scene.  His good Perception check helped him see a woman looking down at the scene from a nearby apartment before closing the curtains.  Sneaking past guards, Wyld found the woman and interrogated her.  Turns out she had witnessed the entire scene- two cloaked men had attacked Harmon in the alley when Rowena appeared to try and save him.  She slashed one of the men (explaining the blood on her axe) but the assailants slipped away right before the Watch came and arrested her.  The witness wanted to confess what she saw but the Watch members that arrested Rowena threatened the witness to keep her silence.  Wyld promised her a safehouse in exchange for her testimony and managed to get her to his spy contact safely, avoiding some not-so-conspicuous tails along the way.

Wyld returned to the library and reported his findings.  The party decided that they needed to investigate Harmon's death further while keeping their witness safe.  So they split into two groups: one group (Thurmiir, Doc, and Emil) would take Rowena's lawyer to the Watch HQ to investigate Harmon's corpse and cast *speak with dead* on it while the other group (Foster, Wyld, and Vette) would keep the witness safe until they were sure they could trust the Watch.  Rasha elected to escort the imperial family back to the palace and, after disguising themselves with *seeming*, the groups set off.

**The Watch Conspiracy**

Group 1 headed to Watch HQ.  They were told that *speak with dead* had already been cast and thus couldn't be cast for another 10 days but they were welcome to have their lawyer examine the body as this was within her legal right, something I learned that very session because I don't watch Law and Order.  The moment the party stepped into the body storage, the Watch cleric cast *silence* on the room and the lawyer was shot in the head, killing her instantly.  

At the exact same time, Group 2 made it to the safehouse easily and discovered that Vette's new beau Travis JUST SO HAPPENS to work there. And what do you know, Vette chose the SAME EXACT DISGUISE as last night, meaning Travis recognized her! HoW cRaZy!!! So after dealing with that awkwardness, group 2 kept the witness safe but were interrupted by a crossbow drive-by.  Thus, I ran two different fights at the same time.  Group 2 fireballed the crossbow assassins and killed them rather quick while Vette accidentally revealed her status as a Valkyrie to Travis, much to his bewilderment.  Group 1 meanwhile knocked out the guards (Emil chopped the captain's hand off with his ~~lightsaber~~ SUN BLADE) and the gang boarded up the room as more guards came to bust them.  Thurmiir cast *sending* to Rasha to bring reinforcements to Watch HQ and she quickly arrived.  They investigated Harmon's body and it was revealed that he died from small blade wounds, *not* a massive greataxe.  Coupled with the witness testimony Group 2 provided, the party had gathered enough evidence to exonerate Rowena, making all my trial prep work completely useless (it was gonna be so cool guys, there was gonna be false testimony and a paid off judge to rule Rowena guilty, you have no idea).  However, celebration was cut short.  Though Rowena didn't kill Harmon, someone with the connections to bribe a lot of Watch members did and no one knows why.  And to make matters worse, Rowena's magic axe, a legendary axe containing awesome power that was once wielded by a famous hero, has been stolen from the evidence locker.  The investigation has just started...

**Putting the Pieces Together**

Interrogating the corrupt Watch members revealed that they had been paid off by the mysterious Blackguard through their mysterious go-betweener, the Firebrand.  The Firebrand was an intimidating human whose description matched that of Vette's new boyfriend Travis, a red herring meant to sow mistrust but was never picked up on (my group has literally just learned this fact from this post most likely).  The Watch communicated with the Blackguard through magic paper that transferred the message to a different piece held by the Blackguard.  The party had found like 3 of these things and NEVER did anything with them.  I honestly don't know why.  

Anyway, the Watch had no idea where to find the Blackguard and didn't even know who or what they were.  Thus, the party went back to investigating.  After going to Harmon's estate and talking to his wife, they learned that Harmon liked to spend some nights at a noble friend's house for wild sex parties that can only be attended by invitation.  Luckily (?), the one-armed, 60 year-old wizard of the group, Doc, had received one not too long ago through carousing.  So he brought Foster as his plus one and they set out to work (in more ways than one).  Talking with the noble, the party uncovered that Harmon had been working on a top secret case of his own investigating a shifty prosecutor named Calser Vormop before Harmon's death.  And with the help of Not!Amy Santiago, the try-hard imperial palace guard with a massive girlcrush on Rasha (which is just like a *whole* other thing), the party found where Vormop works.  The gang (plus a now free Rowena and a jobless Rasha) tracked down the lawyer and learned the final pieces of the puzzle.

Vormop had been contacted by the Firebrand as well to falsify evidence in favor of their men.  When Harmon got wind of this, the Blackguard had him assassinated to silence him.  The Watch were supposed to stonewall the investigation and sweep it under the rug but when Rowena dashed on to the crime scene everything went to hell.  To save their own skin, the Blackguard had Rowena pinned for the crime in order to steal her axe.  Vormop, wanting to save his own skin, told them that while he didn't know the Blackguard's location, he knew another corrupt guard who did.  After some shenanigans with the dwarf cleirc Thurmiir (who had snuck off to find the guard first and decided to to try and solve the case himself because he's an asshole), the party plus Rowena and Rasha discovered the Blackguard's secret headquarters, hidden in the tunnels beneath the city.

**The Blackguard Revealed**

The party battled through some guard drakes, survived a booby trapped hallway, and fought some drunken Watch members in the hideout's brothel, and charged into the Blackguard's quarters.  There they discovered the Blackguard was a female red dragonborn named Kerrhylon Synthrin (god I hate dragonborn names).  Synthrin revealed that she was once a good paladin who was left behind as a POW by her fellow paladins and decided that being good had gotten her nowhere in life.  So she began worshiping Tiamat, called up her rich sorcerer brother Ghesh (who disguised himself as the human Firebrand) to help fund her operation, and became the Blackguard in an attempt to rule the criminal underground.  With her tale concluded, Ghesh appeared with reinforcements and Synthrin activated Rowena's axe to begin battle.  It was a hard fought battle, especially since Ghesh could Subtle Spell *counterspell* to secretly negate magic (as ""punishment"" for the party having two counterspellers.  Seriously guys, LET ME HAVE FUN BY FIREBALLING YOU TO DEATH IT'S NOT FAIR).  But then Wyld completely wrecked the encounter first by using a Wand of Wonder to turn Ghesh into a statue and then by knocking out Synthrin with a well place sneak attack *shadow blade*.  With that, the battle was won and the investigation was over.  Rasha was knocked unconscious in the fight but everyone agreed not to talk about that ~~for their own safety~~ out of respect.

**Epilogue**

The Kerrhylon siblings, as well as everyone connected to them, were arrested and as thanks the party received all siblings magic swag- including the Headband of Intellect that made Ghesh a genius instead of the blithering idiot he secretly was.  Rowena was sent home a free woman and the party convinced the prince to take her on a Not!Date to lift her spirits.  Vette has decided to try and pursue Travis and see where things go and be honest about who she is (which Foster has begrudgingly blessed).  Rash took to heart what everyone said about letting herself be happy and we ended last session with her knocking on Emil's door to talk about what happened.  And the party got a whole bunch of swag and gold and will soon be heading out to the magic capital of the world to deal with a warforged uprising, magical shenanigans, and to buy magic trading cards.  Also they made a customizable weapon with basically Materia slots and a shield that catapults alchemist fire.  Because why not I guess.

Thanks to these sessions, I learned a lot about prepping a mystery adventure, the Three Clues Rule (always have at least three clues because the party will either ignore or misinterpret the firs two clues), that sometimes you do a lot of work that never gets used, and that the Wand of Wonder is a FUCKING STUPID ITEM THAT COMPLETELY RUINS THE BALANCE OF THE GAME AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE BECAUSE IT'S SO FUCKING DUMB.",dndnext_test,How My Campaign Became a Soap Opera Part 2: Turnabout Valkyrie

0,0,28,20,"Hear me out. I got to thinking about this because the PHB makes stealth and perception overly complicated, especially when it comes to defining perception checks made with specific senses.

Rolling for stealth doesn't do anything to make you unseen. You have to be obscured by some other means *first*, before you can even roll for stealth (such as hiding in darkness or fog). What stealth **does do** is allow you to move undetected by making your movements *quiet*. Things that make you noisy (heavy armors) give you stealth penalties. Things that make you quieter (boots of elvenkind, pass without trace) give you stealth bonuses.

On the other hand, when enemies try to perceive you they supposedly use ***all*** their senses to do so, *right?* Well, not really. Sniffing out enemies with the sense of smell only make sense for some beasts, especially those with keen senses of smell. What's more, smell contests seem somewhat arbitrary as there are no game mechanics to mask your scent. Feeling the vibrations of hidden creatures with an acute sense of touch already has a specific name: tremorsense. And it's only available to a few creatures. Enemies should be looking for you too with their sense of sight. But being heavily obscured causes any sight-based check to fail automatically, including perception checks. The same argument could be made that sight-based checks wont work if you are completely concealed by physical cover, such as being behind a bend in the cave or a building. No special sense can detect a stealthed creature through solid walls, [even tremorsense.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2018/01/22/can-a-creature-with-tremorsense-locate-player-while-he-is-moving-in-stealth/)

That leaves hearing as the main means of detecting a hidden creature.

Now I know Stealth is left largely in the DM's hand, and when a hidden creature is detected you can roll-play the discovery as coming about by whatever means is most entertaining.

But in a purely *mechanical* sense, thinking of stealth/perception as primarily an auditory contest helps keeps things straight in my mind. It also opens up some interesting realizations:

* Dim light's perception penalties don't really help you hide, as those penalties apply only to sight-based checks and you are already obscured or concealed by full cover. Or just invisible.
* Keen Sight in a creature's stat block won't help them detect you either... but most creatures with keen sight also come equipped with keen hearing or smell so that they still retain their perception bonuses even when they can't see you.
* Environmental effects that create *noise* should do as much, or more, to hinder enemy perception as any effect involving light and darkness.
* All creatures in 5e possess a sense of hearing. So weird overlapping sensory rules involving sight/smell/hearing/blindness basically fall away. If they can hear you clearly, then their perception rolls and passive perception act as normal.
* Sight based perception bonuses and penalties do have a use: observing objects and environmental features.
* This helps keep clear in player's minds that stealth rolls are only about sound. Staying out of sight is a totally different responsibility that isn't covered by the roll.

Anyway, this is something I was mulling over while writing a stealth guide. If there are any glaring holes in this, or of this is glaringly obvious to you all, let me know. It will help with the guide.

8 18 13 16 12 10 AC 19 (Studded Leather and +1 shield) Dueling Fighting Style

I'm in a campaign right now with a giant table. We have about eight people on any given night. However, the only tanks are myself and a barbarian. I've gone for the Dex build because I thought of him as an all-rounder initially, but it's become clear over the last two or three levels that the party needs me to be front-line. Pretty much every character is either a caster, an archer, or a squishy rogue/monk, and I'm now regretting not going with a different class. My only effective melee weapon is a rapier, so I pray that my enemies don't have resistance to piercing weapons. I don't love that my only move is ""casting stab,"" (I was hoping that an EK would have spells that would be pretty damaging) but I get a good chunk of RP action thanks to my sage background and my inability to keep secrets.

I've come to terms with my spells and my DM has been helpful in allowing me to switch spells that aren't working. I mostly only use them for reactions and for a familiar. We're going to be hitting 6th level soon, and I'll stay in EK so that I can get the ASI, but I'm thinking about multiclassing afterwards because of how lackluster War Magic seems to be without the SCAG cantrips (which I did not take). I'll ask my DM about using Shocking Grasp with a shield or switching it out for Booming Blade, but I'm not sure I'm invested in it. I definitely don't want to have to take a feat (War Caster) because I ""built the character incorrectly.""

Should I just stick with EK until 10, and multiclass at 11 or should I find another class to get into? If I do mutliclass after 6 levels, what class could I multi into? We have four spellcasters already and we have six if you include the rogue and myself. It seems like Swashbuckler might be ok, but I have 0 Cha so it won't be super helpful for anything other than having advantage more often.

A barbarian without rage still hits like a truck, a base rogue doesn't really have any limited abilities and dishes out crazy damage and a fighter without action surge... is actually fair. 

Obviously monks have their place on the battlefield, they are extremely mobile and have great CC and can dps race with the best of them... with ki points.

A monk without ki points is a depressingly bad fighter and with how few you get it feels like you'd be asking for a short rest after every single combat or never ever using ki points until you fight a boss. This is too bad, because monks are certainly cool and can out-mobility pretty much any class, but their entire offensive (and cc) power is tied to ki points.

Even warlocks with no spell slots have eldritch blast or in the case of hexblade, bashing people in the face with charisma (or both). Warlocks also get really cool invovations, some of which can be used at will, and monks... get some passives that just sort of help them not die.

I don't want to say that monks are weak, because from what I've seen they can be total monsters... with ki points. Once they run out though it seems like your only option is short rest or be gimped.

When she returns home, she is pissed, and tracks them down one by one, tearing them to pieces.

From a lore standpoint, the bard is supposed to be a master of the senses and many of the spells back this up and give it the uniqueness that makes sense but, others contradict this. Looking at the bard's cantrips, we see that of the 9 official spells, 7 are purely sensory based and, one could argue that, through the power of suggestion, a bard can make these ""magical"" feats possible.

We were playing Rise of Tiamat. The party reached the Tomb of Diderius. On the way, we've met some locals who've warned us about ""snake men"" killing and kidnapping people. Long story short, we've discovered a yuan-ti hideout in the caves below the tomb. The entrance was guarded by some lizardfolk. They've attacked us, but were defeated... and spared, because a couple of sessions ago the party had helped another lizardfolk tribe free themselves from the enslavement by the Cult of the Dragon and by a black dragon. So, we've spared those lizardfolk, too. The creatures told us about being enslaved by the yuan-ti and even being occasionally fed to the yuan-ti young. We've promised to free them, and we did.

Skip forward a couple of battles, and we have the yuan-ti high priestess as our prisoner. She begs for mercy and gives up all the hidden treasure. At first, my character (a lawful-good wizard) and another character intend to let her go. Others are  largely indifferent. But then...

I remembered that this nest has been murdering the (innocent) locals and feeding then to the brood. That they've enslaved a tribe of lizardfolk. That they've worshipped Seth, an evil god. That they were yuan-ti, and in the world of Forgotten Realms this race is inherently evil, by its very nature. Because, unlike in Eberron, in Toril mortal races are under strong influence of the gods, and the gods made all the races a certain way, and constantly push them towards certain behaviour. Basically, evil races are evil not because they choose to be, but because of the power of the gods. So they can't choose to stop being evil.

Basically, my character saw that if he'd let the priestess go she would just nurture the baby snakes into new yuan-ti army (feeding many villagers to them in the process) and then resume her worship of Seth, which would inevitably lead to yuan-ti emerging from below and tearing their way through the countryside, killing and enslaving ""worm-bloods"".

So my wizard told the others to execute the priestess and burn the younglings. He chose a coward's way out, too, not participating in the slaughter. He told himself that the little snakes were still non-sapient creatures (which is true), and that this decision would save many innocent lives (which it most likely would).

0,0,61,28,"So, Last night we started up a text based D&amp;D game. There was on point that the GM messages me and told me that due to my background/history, I got to know something the rest of the party didn't and I could explain. I said awesome, made a post where my character reacted, and than was going to explain everything but due to the details and the fact that it was our first interaction with the person, I was going to use a new post to do it, so that way everyone gets to react to the person and my character made a clear she KNEW who the person was.   


One of the player a lvl 1 divine Rogue, asks why my character already knew, I said it was something about her background and she was going to let the group in on it. Next thing he's in the OOC channel saying he wants to do a history check to see if he knows anything. Because he's playing Kor, when he rolled 2, he used his lucky trait to reroll and got a 20 which meant he learned everything, and than GAVE All of the information to the party.   


When I messaged him about him, he informed me: ""Listen, it's not my fault because I didn't know your character came from this area or knows this person, maybe you shouldn't have held back information.""   


Now so far every part of this since this person has joined the moment someone goes to do something, he does it, between the lucky feat, and also the Reliable Talent trait that he has, essentally means the rest of the party is kind of turning pointless since he's all over the place and doing everything. Which I'm not sure if this just me over-reacting, or if this could actually be a possible problem in the future of the game, because like last night granted it was a small detail, it was extremely letting down of: ""Cool, my character knows this and-Or....never mind....""

# Viewers Questions

* Do you prefer watching people with or without face cameras?
* Does it matter what quality of camera they use?
* If someone is uncomfortable showing their face on camera, would it be acceptable if one of the players doesn't show their face?
* Does a professional stream overlay make a difference?
* What makes an overlay look good to you?
* What makes a stream worth watching to you?
* What annoys you or prevents you from watching a stream?
* What advice would you give to streamers that would make watching them entertaining to you?

**These Questions are specific to me**

* I have a person who uses facerig. Would you watch 4 face cameras and 1 facerig camera?
* How do you feel about watching people play D&amp;D in VR? Such as VRChat, where you see each player in an avatar sitting around a D&amp;D table.
* I can create custom worlds and avatars for VR that would allow me and my players to actually be their characters in VR and actually play through the dungeon i would create. That is a whole lot of prep work for a single session. Would that be something you would like to see happen? Or are you rather indifferent and I shouldn't waste my time?

Hence the undead rising from the graves and, the rift to the abyss. So the PC's will need to get rid off all the moon rock which is causing the rift to the abyss to open.

The danger of invading the resting place of a wizard is a deadly one. Glyphs of Warding, monsters, and many traps. On the other hand a Transmuter's Stone can do some cool stuff. Sure, once the 6th level wizard is dead the stone can't change it's effect, but I'm sure some rich snob would love to boast how the stone on their ring is a Transmuter's Stone. It means they have a 6th level Transmutation Wizard under their sway, or they were rich enough to buy one from an adventuring party.

The value wouldn't come from it's effects, but rather it's rarity. It's not something you can just find lying around. If you're in the middle of a gala and the stone on your bracelet disappears that could be a silent warning something's gone wrong to the extent your wizard needs their stone back.

A noble walking around with 5 transmuter's stones bought them, or has enough power that they command 5 Transmutation Wizards. Before you insult this person, ask yourself, is it worth the risk?

So my party will soon head for a Desert city that is highly technologically advanced (they created airships in my world) it is ruled by a Sorcerer-King in an Avatar like process that when one king dies it’s soul is reincarnated into a new body and new person. 

Passed down through generations of these Kings/Queens is the “Primordial Key” a key that connects their body to the elemental chaos and allows them to control the weather and do minor elemental miracles. (Only the Sorcerer-king/queen can attune to the stone and do these miracles)

This item also happens to be an item that can close rifts to the elemental chaos and banish elementals (without attunement) . Which is what the party needs to do for a few BBEGs 

However I’m planning on when they finally get an audience with this King, that it turns out one of the Kings advisors has been impersonating him to keep up charades because the real king has been kidnapped (along with the primordial key). 

Problem I’m having is how do I kidnap the king and create an interesting side adventure. I’ve wondered what creature might do that. 

It should be of note this city has an Oracle that is able to divine prophecies and such, she was able to get a small glimpse of the king before not being able to scry on him again this will give the party a lead to follow.

In the entry it speaks of a ritual that involves bathing in the blood of a dragon to become a Half-dragon. Well being the kind of person I am (the type that like crazy things happening in sessions) i really started to look into the lore behind this, and I found a few variations. 

The first is very bland, where one would bath in roughly 40 gallons of draconic blood (all from the same dragon obviously) for an hour and, poof, you're  a half dragon. Now idk about y'all but that just seems to boring to me.

Now there was another that was similar but you had to remain submerged in the blood fully for that hour, which generally would say that you would need some magic, or an item, or another person who is magic, to pull this one off. 

And the last one was basically putting said pool of blood inside a pentagram. Seems a bit edgy.

I had one idea myself where on top of submerging oneself inside the blood for an hour you would also need to ingest a very certain mixture of ingredients just before entering the pool for the magic to truly take hold.

Currently looking at the following subclasses - the Dreams or Shepherd circle druids and the Archfey warlock. Glamor bard exists but my DM and I have had difficulty navigating an agreement on what would be considered a harmful action for charm and suggestion effects, so unfortunately my original idea of a Wild Sorcerer/Glamor Bard is out the window. So this character, instead of focusing on the glamour-like aspects that figures like Galadriel and Pan have, will instead be focusing on Dryad or Nymph-like qualities of seeming, shapeshifting and a natural/nurturing connection.

So far, my DM has allowed:

* The ability to keep Wild Magic surges, because nothing screams feywild like unpredictable magic. We're both just looking for a decent table to use, if anyone has any suggestions.
* The ability to encounter creatures I could entice into my service with Pact of the Chain, like a faerie dragon instead of a pseudodragon.
* One magic item (with approval) - our rogue, for example, got themselves a set of Bracers of Protection.

&amp;#x200B;

Mechanically I'm kind of struggling to figure out how to build this character. Our party so far consists of a Bladelock, a Sorlock, a Necromancy Wizard, a OoA paladin and a swashbuckler. I'm the only dedicated support our party has, which puts me in a bind for action economy and action efficacy. This leads me to the main deal here - what are the advantages of dream vs shepherd circle? 

Would I be mistaken in saying that dream's advantage being spell conservation and action efficiency through the use of its circle features to replicate spell-like effects (healing word, leomund's, misty step, etc)? As opposed to Shepherd's strategy of overwhelming or controlling the action economy balance through numbers/grappling/damage, etc. with durable, threatening minions? Even faithful summons seems useful when you realize you could potentially Gandalf out of a bad situation with a bunch of giant eagles (or quetzacoatl) to bear you to safer ground.

Shepherd is solid in both theme and crunch, but I feel like summons and playing mechanically well might overwhelm my DM, who is still new to DM'ing and seems scared of his PC's being too powerful, despite throwing several homebrew monsters at us that left us inches from TPK. I've discussed with him the goodberry/unicorn spirit tactic along with the life domain cleric bonuses and he's nix'd it, ruling that it wouldn't work according to the sage advice rulings. Kind of unhappy about that, considering how close we are to dying every single time, but it is what it is.

I really like the theme of the Dreams druid, since I feel like it would fit my intended character's concept more. But when it comes to actually being supportive, and not just healing throughput, how does the Dreams druid really shine? I'm trying to justify a reason to take this circle when shepherd just seems more useful in terms of group healing (where most healers really struggle) and battle control through their summons as effective THP for the party if nothing else.

Blur is great.  It's issues is its a second level spell slot (competing for shadowblade /web/misty step etc) and our paladin has a home brewed version of the protection fighting style where he can mark a target.  It gets disadvantage attacking anyone but him during this and if the target attacks someone else he gets an aoo on that target (still only one aoo per turn).  Result is like a localized blur effect.

Blink is nice but it's issues is it sometimes does nothing.  And I have the mobile feat as it is so I'm often sifting in and out of melee.

0,0,34,34,"TL;DR: PBP game. Players never fully investigated the mystery despite multiple NPCs subtly telling them what to investigate, and are following something down a dead end instead. Give them more hints, let them hit the dead end, rewrite the story, or something else?

I'm a pretty experienced player, but I'm little more than a novice DM.

I ran a kidnapping story in a play-by-post game which was to be the start of a story arc. The PCs found the victim and easily killed the mini-boss, but got distracted and failed to investigate the lair. After walking away from my clues (and some undiscovered loot) there, they returned the victim to the town watch, but never investigated her story much (missing more clues there). The contact at the watch asked pointed questions about these things, but they didn't take the hint to go find the answers.

OK, they're not real into the mystery. But no - they did want to follow up on this one object they recovered, which I hadn't intended as a clue.

So I made it a little clue. An NPC discussed the object with them, gave them a little info, and *twice* said that he would really like to know more about the kidnapping victim and the lair. They ignored that completely and stayed focused on this object. That's partially my fault; I had the object stolen for reasons related to the larger story, and now they've clearly gotten the idea that this little plot is all about the theft. The nature of the theft makes it unlikely that they'll get anywhere investigating it.

So...do I give them more IC hints on where to investigate? Do I tell them OOC to re-read the NPC interactions for ideas? Do I let them bang their heads against this wall until they're forced to rethink things? Do I rewrite things to make it more productive for them to investigate the theft?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The responses seemed to really run the gamut here; appreciate all the (constructive) input. I'm opting for an NPC to find the clues for them if necessary.

0,0,73,14,"I'm curious how people are running the various summon spells, because the RAW method has a number of aspects I consider cumbersome or unintuitive, especially for new players. To review:

- RAW, when you cast any of the ""Conjure ____"" type spells, it gives you a choice between various CR ""tiers"". While this is not stated outright, apparently this means the player/PC picks the CR tier, but the DM picks the actual monster(s) that appear using that tier as a guide.

- Initiative is rolled for whatever is summoned as a group, possibly differing from the caster PC's initiative. If it's higher, the summons will sit around until they go on the next initiative turn.

This is weird and unsatisfying to me for a few reasons:

- The player does not get to experience any of the satisfaction of choosing their own monsters, either for tactical usefulness for the situation at hand, or just if they have a favorite type they want to summon (or even roleplay as if they're summoning the same one each time to interact with).

- Having the monsters roll their own initiative is awkward, random, and slows down the game. Sometimes they'll go right after you for maximal effectiveness, sometimes they'll sit around getting pot-shotted or dispelled or whatever till it's nearly your turn again. Also it's an extra initiative the caster has to roll and keep track of, in addition to the extra set of actions, hp, conditions, etc. they're already going to bookkeep. I know many DMs who just have familiars go on their master's turn for the same reason.

- All together it makes these spells some of the least consistent and trustworthy spells in the book. Which is fine and cool in the case of, say, Conjure Elemental, where when you lose concentration it becomes uncontrollable, displaying the risky nature of summoning rituals! But this is a purely mechanical annoyance.

However, simply removing these restrictions has its own problems. The spells are mad _powerful_ when the player gets to choose and/or when they go on the player's turn right after them. A group of charging elk, pack tactics wolves, or especially the dreaded pixie swarm can obliterate at-level encounters if these restrictions are lifted.

But leaving them in place just feels...bad and dumb. I've had a player retire their PC (a druid) once already because I was running it RAW, and honestly I couldn't blame them. Not getting to pick what you summon is lame. Not getting to use what you summon till almost a full turn later (when it happens) is lame. Taking up even more game time on these rolls and bookkeeping, when summon spells already add more by their very nature, is lame.

item rarity: Rare

Requires attunment, proficency carpenters/shipbuilders tools, &amp; proficiency is vehicle being bound

An old rum bottle aproximately 1ft long and 6in diamiter. Floating inside is a ship that looks worn and weathered. Can only be attuned by the riteful captain. When the cork is pulled a message on damp pachment comes out that has a ritual written on it. The ritual is an 8 hour ordeal requiring it be performed on the deck of the owned ship by the Captain, First mate, and Quartermaster (all are optional except the captain). Those who participate in the ritual are bound to the item and can use its powers (only the captain is attuned though).  When the ritual is completed the ship inside looks identical to the vessal bound. Once per day can cast mend via the bottle and will repair all minor damge to the ship, cannot not repair holes larger that 1ft, repair any mast larger than 1ft in thickness, or any other repairs exceeding the peramiters of the mend spell. Any time the captain acquires a new vessal the ritual can be preformed again to bind the new ship or to absorb the new ship into the old binding the 2 ships together. The captain can choose the new layout of the ship based on the 2 ships combined (if a 2 mast 3 deck ship and a 3 mast 3 deck ship are combined then the captain can choose any number of masts and decks up to the total of both combined. This does not change the needed number of crew to sail the ship, so increaseing a ship size increases the needed crew to sail it efficiently), the captain can choose to rework any part of the ship in any dimenstions or artistic design as long as it doesn't exceed the cost of the 2 vessels used. All weapons, personal efects and things not part of the ship are moved to the equivilent room in the new vessel or to the hold if not specified.

It says, that it takes x workweeks to make an item.

One of my players, says that the Item Value, is the base market price, given on the books.  
Other one, says that it would be stupid that one armorer, would take 150 days (30 workweeks) to craft an full plate armor alone and that the GP price that should be used to determine the amount of Workweeks, should be the material costs.  
So, for the Full Plate, there would be 750 PO. Hence 15 Workweeks or 75 Days.

Cleric: I use Detect Good and Evil.

DM: you sense a hell of a ton of undead.

Cleric: is the ground hallowed or desecrated?

DM: uh, yeah it’s desecrated.

Cleric: I will use Detect Magic to discover the spell, am I familiar with it?

DM: You can tel it’s a Hallow spell.

Cleric: a hallow spell you say? 

Dm: yes, but you get a sense that it is far too powerful to dispel.

Cleric: oh, I’m not gonna try to dispel it. Guys, I have a plan. Do you think you could watch my back for a little under half an hour?

Party: yeah sure

DM: what are you trying to do? You’re outside the dungeon gates so you have time to cast something in preparation without attracting any attention. 

The cleric, smiling, takes out a vial of very expensive powered ruby he bought at the last major town.

Cleric: I’m going to cast Forbiddance.

DM: could you please post it in the chat?

The Cleric posts the spell and the DM realizes he’s made a terrible mistake.

DM: well, it can’t be that bad. You used your only 6th level spell slot for the day.

Cleric: it’s a ritual, my dude.

The DM realizes it’s too late to renege and the cleric finishes casting.

Suddenly, every single undead in that dungeon starts to get seared with radiant magic every 6 seconds, completely oblivious to the intruders outside.

The smarter creatures teleport out before being completely torn apart, in an attempt to summon reinforcements, unaware that they can’t return to the dungeon after leaving for the next 24 hours, and by that time, the adventurers are far gone.

The party then proceeds to go through the dungeon to the McGuffin, avoiding any encounters as bodies of undead litter the ground. The DM strongly regrets making all the dungeon’s inhabitants undead.

Obviously, this scenario is probably never going to happen the way this played out, but the point stands that with it’s huge area, it can completely obliterate every Fiend/Elemental/Undead/Fey that’s already inside of the area before they have a chance to react. Heck, even Celestials would be affected, they’d just die slower. There is only one creature in the official sources that is downright immune to radiant damage, and that’s the Skulk which is a CR 1/2 humanoid, which wouldn’t be affected by the spell regardless.

Flying creatures can escape it as it only effects up to 30 feet in the air, but inside a dungeon environment creatures won’t have that liberty.

A very easy way to counter this is by stating that 
there already is a Forbiddance spell in the area, but if the DM doesn’t think to explicitly state there is one, it means that the damage can be catastrophic. 

Other counters include spell-casters with 6th level Dispel Magic in the area. However, if there aren’t any, unless the DM pulls stuff out of thin air, this can completely bypass a big portion of an adventure. 

The fact that the materials aren’t consumed upon use and it’s a ritual also increase its potential use. Also, since it’s a Cleric spell, all they need to do is prepare it, since unlike Arcane spell casters, they have access to every single spell on their list that they can swap around each long rest.",dndnext_test,Forbiddance is an incredibly underrated and potentially game breaking spell.

My idea for Warforged is they were created centuries ago by dwarven smiths to contain a great red wyrm truly massive and ancient, a son of Tiamat. This wyrm was burrowing into their mountain fortress and the dwarves forged massive adamantine chains to trap and imprison this beast. The Warforged were to hold the chains eternally and prevent the destruction of the dwarven city-state. Crafted from the souls of volunteers on a divine forge these Warforged would be eternal guardians. These initial chains were not enough however and more had to be crafted and more Warforged. When there were no more volunteers the old and the sick were conscripted and bound into these bodies slaved to the will of the crown. As chained snapped or Warforged destroyed more and more citizens were taken men and women all in the name of protecting the city until even the children began to be taken and forged into these eternal sentinels. As the last chains were wrapped around the dragon pinning him in place for eternity the city has been emptied almost every single citizen taken and enslaved. 
The Warforged would all have a different emblem engraved upon their chest depending on their class volunteer conscript or child.

I’m starting to plan a campaign that I’d like to run from 1-20 and recently I’ve been wondering how to solve the “problem” of death for higher-level characters being nearly negligible as soon as they have a level 5 Cleric (or access to one). Barring restricting the amount of diamonds/diamond dust available to the players, I feel like the overall threat level to the characters drops significantly once they cross the resurrection power threshold into Tier 2.

Does the following system sound too restrictive, or like I’m adding too much of a punishment for dying? Basically, I figure that every time a character dies and is resurrected, one of their death saves is permanently filled in. After their first resurrection it only takes 2 failed saves to die. After a 2nd time, only a single failed death save will kill them. Then finally, after a 3rd resurrection, they’ll die permanently if they even hit 0 HP. 

Basically, every time they die, they leave a little piece of themselves behind and fate won’t let them escape death forever. It’s also a good reason for adventurer NPCs to have retired before they themselves reached the absolute height of power.

Finally, I’m also wondering if it would be more interesting to tell this to the players at session 0, or to just tell them that I have homebrewed rules for death and resurrection and that they’ll find out what the rules are after someone’s resurrected.

Kobolds I personally see as different, since most humanoids think of them as weak, and Volo’s Guide states that in their ideal world, they’d just be left alone to do their own thing. However, they still *are* monsters, so I imagine people would have a similar wariness of them as they would Tieflings.
As for other ministers, I imagine Hobgoblins could be recognized by common races such as humans as master strategests, and Hobgoblins would in turn recognize the versatility of humans, leading to possible wary alliances against a common foe, or if there’s a clear mutual benefit.

Of course, there’s no real answer, since every DM does things differently, but I’d like to hear your thoughts on how various monstrous races would fit into your world. Are they all shunned?

0,0,35,13,"I'd like to know if the following house-rule is fair and not broken or exploitable somehow.

Currently, rules-as-written, if you are concentrating on Spell A and casting Spell B, if Spell B requires concentration, then you immediately lose Spell A.

This is frustrating if you only wanted to cast Spell B for its ""instant"" effect (usually damage), and not to keep it active afterwards. So it seems like losing the concentration on Spell A is too high of a price to pay, considering you almost certainly won't get the full effect of Spell B anyways.

For example: Let's say that your druid is currently concentrating on [Barkskin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/barkskin), a buff spell that they want to keep focusing on. They are in combat and they want to cast a damaging spell on an enemy, but the highest-damage spell they have is [Wall of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire).

Under my suggested houserule, the druid could cast Wall of Fire ""momentarily"", dealing 5d8 fire damage to anyone inside it and then removing it right away (and not keeping it on the battlefield to deal any more damage), while still keeping their Barkskin. It doesn't make sense that the Druid has to resort to Cantrips even though they clearly have a more powerful spell to cast, just because it's a spell that only in other situations would have been useful to keep concentrating on.

My reasoning for this is that, as far as I've seen, all Concentration spells either have no immediate effect or a weak immediate effect (for example, compare [Wall of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire) to [Fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball), which is 1 spell-level lower yet deals more damage (5.5 extra, on average).

Thoughts? Is there some Concentration spell with instant effects that are too good for this to be allowed to happen?

(Clarification - by ""immediate effect"" I only mean the effects that happen right as you cast the spell. If the effect only happens when you spend a bonus action, or on your next attack, or ""for the spell's duration"" - it's not immediate)",dndnext_test,"Houserule advice - Casting Concentration spells ""momentarily"" without breaking Concentration"

0,0,6,1,"I know I can ask my DM. He made a ruling and we went with it. All is well. Just curious about the groupthink of all the RAWyers out here.

In general: if a creature is affected by prone but no other condition, does inflicting forced movement cancel the prone condition?

Specifically, we were fighting gargoyles in a room such that they are standing inactive next to a big hole and we have devised from the room how to activate them one by one. For each gargoyle, we set up a plan for everybody to do damage as an opening volley as we activate the gargoyle, then before it gets its first turn off our two frontliners use their last few attacks to knock the gargoyle prone (so its speed is 0 and it can’t fly) and shove it into the hole. Does the gargoyle get to start flying as it is shoved over the hole, or does it fall? The two competing theories were:

(A) the prone condition is a condition, and its mechanical effects do not end unless something happens that explicitly says they do (such as the garg spending half its movement to get up). Therefore, it would fall and be subject to fall damage.

(B) The gargoyle was prone on the floor, but since it was pushed off the floor that instance of the prone condition no longer applies. The gargoyle can then begin flying and requires a separate prone application to cause it to fall.

(C) It’s not realistic that the gargoyle would automatically have no chance to right itself before it hit the ground (I’m not sure how far the fall was), so it can have a dex save to see whether it can right itself and, if so, how far it falls before that happens.

I’m aware that for both B and C, we can (and indeed, we did!) just reverse the order of our shove/prone attacks. Still curious what others think about this in theory, and if there is any obvious rule I have missed in my own consideration.

So...what do y’all think?",dndnext_test,Does forced movement cancel prone?

0,0,4,0,"  

I’m looking for some help turning a character concept I have into a viable build. It’s an interesting concept, but I am having trouble nailing down class and build. Or… more specifically a class and build most DMs will go for. 

Concept: A Chimera. A creature made by a mad scientist that is the distillation of many different animals. Normally, they look like a small fox, but they are sentient and can morph their body to adapt to different situations. I would like the build to focus around this ability.

Now, the perfect class for this is a Mystic that only focuses on the Immortal order. With its disciplines, you can have the character morph their body to have gills, larger, eyes, tougher skin, or larger claws. They can increase their strength, speed, or size, and spit venom or even have acidic blood. Every skill would focus on changing or adapting the body in a verity of ways. You would have to ignore almost all of the other Mystic orders as calling fourth walls of fire, or teleportation don’t really fit the theme of this build. The problem is, as many of you know, many DMs will not touch a Mystic with a 10 foot poll. I would also hesitate to let a player at my table build an unrestricted Mystic because of their insane versatility and a few broken combos (Anyone ever shrink down to the size of a gnat and then mind blast villains silently, so they have no chance of even knowing where to retaliate?) While I think restricting the Mystic to just one order like my proposed build solves most of the issues with a Mystic, a lot of DMs still would not green light it. So! I need other options!

One obvious class would be the Moon Circle druid. If you focus on wild shaping, you can pretty much achieve the same concept, except it is less about adapting your body and more about straight turning into other animals. However, there are a few issues with this type of build some of you may be able to offer insight on.  
 The animal cannot talk in the normal way. Being a ghostwise gnome for the base race would at least allow it to communicate with the other players though telepathy, but spell casting would be almost impossible. A Druid that can’t cast spells, even a Moon circle sub class, is shooting themselves in the foot. To be honest, even if the DM allowed the animal to cast spells, it doesn’t really fit the theme. The focus should be on morphing the body, not casting sun beam. You can use your spell slots to heal animal forms, and that’s nifty, but still makes for a far weaker druid than one that casts spells. Maybe multiclass? Barbarian for rage? How would you build a wild shaping druid who does not cast spells?

Are there any other classes/multiclasses, that are not straight homebrew, that could work? I am no power gamer, and I do not mind bringing a character to the table that is far from optimized. However, I do not want to bring a character that is so hamstrung it brings the rest of the party down.

I am looking for advice on how to use the Couatl intelligently. It will be used to overthrow and replace the crime syndicates of a major city while my character is off adventuring. I can obtain it through Planar Binding + Conjure Celestial. (I am currently deciding my 14th level Magical Secrets for my Bard. The purpose of this post is to help me see how effective the Couatl can be. *Please dont worry about the alignment of the Couatl or its willingness to participate.*)

The Couatl is immune to damage from non magical weapons, meaning that it can easily defeat most henchmen. It can scry, detect thoughts, and shape change making it perfect for subterfuge. It can assassinate people through Dream should it so choose, and it can use that same spell to send me updates while my PC sleeps. It can play very similarly to Lazav from MtG, if anyone is aware of him and his stat block from GGtR.

0,0,17,3,"Have to preface this by saying that [JC](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/10/15/how-would-reliable-talent-work-with-a-roguebard-and-their-jack-of-all-trades/) and [Sage Advice](http://www.enworld.org/forum/content.php?6011-Official-D-D-Sage-Advice-Compendium-Updated&amp;page=5) have clarified that the relevant abilities I'm going to talk about don't interact with eachother, so RAI this doesn't work, and here's probably why he ruled as such:

Bard's *Jack of all Trades* lets you **add** half of your proficiency bonus to any ability check that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus, such as Initiative (Dexterity) checks, and Counterspell.

Rogue's *Reliable Talent* essentially means when you make an ability check that ""lets you **add** your proficiency bonus"", you can't roll lower than a 10 on the d20.

Say you took Arcane Trickster as your Roguish Archetype, and at 14th Level (or 13th if you swap out your 8th level spell), you took Counterspell. You then take two levels in Bard to get Jack of All Trades.

RAW is weird about it, because the two features have opposing triggers: Reliable Talent triggers for ability checks you are proficient with, Jack of All Trades triggers for ability checks you are NOT proficient with, but the latter lets you add half your proficiency bonus, seemingly triggering Reliable Talent via the wording in Reliable Talent (hence quotation marks).

I'm all for things being broken, but just for the lulz, here's how **hilarious** this is:

A level 15-16 Rogue (Arcane Trickster) / Bard, that knows Counterspell, with an Intelligence of 20 (+5), **cannot roll lower than a 17 on a Counterspell check**, if these two abilities stack. Spells of 7th level or lower are automatically Counterspelled even if you were to cast Counterspell at its lowest level. When you reach 17th level and your proficiency bonus goes up, this now applies to spells of 8th level or lower, meaning that the only spells you would have to roll for are 9th level spells.

(You would also achieve roughly the same thing at level 17 but with more slots with a level division of Bard 6/Rogue 11 if you choose Lore Bard and Arcane Trickster as your archetypes, but the former division gives you the crazy counterspell check sooner so either one has pros/cons.)

More so than mundane skill checks (because never rolling lower than a 13 on any skill check isn't really that big of a deal at level 17 anyway i mean really), this is probably why JC clarified that the two abilities DON'T interact. If they did, Bard/Rogue would Counter virtually any spell thrown its way, unless Counterspelled itself. A smart caster would know to Counterspell the Counterspell IMO, and an Arcane Trickster/Bard doesn't have that many 3rd level slots, so it's not completely broken, but it's pretty ding dang close.

Personally, I'm all about players being awesome, and Spellcasting BBEG's get all the love. Why not a Monk BBEG, or a Barbarian BBEG? Martial classes can be nasty too, and you don't need spells to be threatening. If your party Counterspeller is locking down your spellcasters, either throw more spellcasters at them or hit them with something that doesn't cast spells. alternatively, the player spent 16 levels building up to this cool idea, let them be cool. 

I get that JC recently clarified the two abilities don't work together, but it's your game and if you like it that they do then that's rad and you're a nice person &lt;3. So your party has a skill monkey with a ridiculous Counterspell, so what? You, the DM, have the ability to change literally anything and everything about the game to make it more challenging without taking stuff away from the players. You could just give your god-tier Vecna-like multiple reactions to Counterspell the Counterspell with, or the ability to cast a spell as a legendary action to force your Counterspeller to choose its moment, just a few examples off the top of my head.

Plus it gives you an opportunity to think outside the box with your Big Bads. I mean, you can't exactly Counterspell Tiamat, but I had this cool idea about an insane gnomish inventor who built a giant clockwork mecha and goes on a rampage.

Bit of backstory, The Legend of Dragoon was a bad ass game released back on the PS1. If you haven't heard of it or played it I would highly recommend it. I wouldn't say it is ground breaking or award winning, but it is a good game, you will probably like it, and I am adapting it to D&amp;D 5e. I have played the game dozens of times. I know the whole game like the back of my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

For those that know of the game and are excited to read that someone is adapting it to D&amp;D here are some of the key points

Dragoons as a bonus class are a thing.

Dragoon spirits, while not necessarily awakened when found will give bonus damage of their element for 1 min to the user of said Dragoon Spirit. This will hopefully entice the players not to forget/sell/give away a Dragoon Spirit before it is revealed what they can do

Since Dart doesn't exist in the campaign as his role is being played out by the player party. I figure I can have Fire Bird watch over the Red Eye Dragoon Spirit, and hopefully some player will be happy to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the skills are a bit overpowered, so I am tweaking the class a bit, but overall a lot is going to be left unchanged.

2 things off the top of my head that will change is, the player will expend exhaustion points to gain SP, however they are not affected by exhaustion while in dragoon form. This can create a dynamic where a player can decide to dump a ton of points into SP to transform and save the party, but at the cost of his own life when the transformation expires. This also may mean there are 6 total SP available not the recommended 4. Although powerful transformations lasting up to 1 min is pretty standard for DnD so I like it. The second change is that, rather than summoning your dragon type to your aid for the durration your SP allows, it will simply act as another spell, much like the playstation game did. Your dragon type shows up, does a thing, and leaves.

I plan to have 4 players in the party as this will be first time as a DM and more will be crazy.

I plan to have Lavitz, Albert, Rose, and Shana, as re-occurring characters that join the party, just to nudge them in the right direction. This may change as things progress.

Lavitz may never actually become a dragoon, simply because I don't want the players to get pissed when they slay a dragon and a DM-PC gets the reward. Shana is special in her own way, Rose is already a dragoon, Lavitz...well. And Albert may not join the party at all, he may just stay a king of newly united Serdio

&amp;#x200B;

Rose will be a Hexblade Warlock

Lavitz/Albert a polearm wielding paladin

Shana a ranger

&amp;#x200B;

Dart and his quest for the black monster does not exist, but the phantom ship will, so Rose will still be the black monster in the end. But no PC will be directly affected by it, unless their backstory deems it so. The town of Neet and the Phantom ship will still be products of Roses work, and she may be in the party during those times to give a bit of foreshadowing.

Obviously one of the biggest choices for most gishes is what you spend your concentration on. Now given the level range we tend to play in (around 5-10), I reckon there are three compelling choices (though obviously I would be interested to hear more)

&amp;#x200B;

* Shadow blade. Pro: nice damage boost, especially upcast; advantage on attacks in dim light is widely applicable. Con: doesn't work with magic weapons (which is obviously campaign dependent); bonus action set-up conflicts with bladesong.
* Haste. Pro: a slew of useful side-benefits, +AC is great in particular given how high you can push it with bladesong. Con: worse damage than shadow blade; loss of concentration is punishing.
* Greater Invisibility: amazing benefits, disadvantage to be attacked in particular reduces the number of crits which are a bladesinger's bane. Con: completely shut down by true sight; lower damage (I think?) but more consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in the game I was playing I went for haste but that was mainly because my character was fluffed as a time mage (loosely based on Nox from Wakfu).

0,0,97,23,"A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b7zx2j/am_i_off_my_nut_or_are_intimidation_and/) (which got mostly downvoted into obscurity) asked if Persuasion and Intimidation were basically the same thing. Other posters also included Deception into this discussion. 

I want to talk about this, but also touch on player agency and the granularity of 5e in general. 

The short version is that I agree with that post: these skills are very, very similar. I also find it strange that in 5e's very simplified environment, that they're separate. 

Consider that History, Arcana, and Medicine are one skill each. A historian is equally versed in military history, elven history, political history, trivia, and seafarer legends. An expert on Arcana is versed in the magic of all classes, of all schools, even if they personally specialize in only one. A sawbones in Forgotten Realms knows how to work on every race, every animal, and knows all the remedies for every ailment (though not how to make them, that's herbalist). 

But if you're a con man or a politician, you need to have three seperate skills, all of which produce the same result, but differ only in their approach. 

A doctor needs one skill. A fast talking merchant needs to invest 3 slots.

For a game that has as stripped down mechanics as 5e and also has very large umbrella skills that seems a little incongruous with design principles. 

This is before we get into the fact that social skills in D&amp;D are basically what the GM lets them be. Every skill is like that, to some extent, but some less so. Medicine, again, has a very specific effect: it allows you to stabilize a character who is making death saves. Persuasion allows you to influence a character. And that's far more tricky and nebulous. 

Say you have a prison guard. It's really, really unlikely that you're going to talk him into just letting you go. You could, however, convince him to come closer so you could get in an attack or to start slipping you contraband in the long game, but even the latter is only if he's inclined to be immoral. All of that may actually be better accomplished, from a fun factor, via role play in any case. 

Spells like Friends or Dominate Person are very cut an dry in what they do. What you can lie, threaten, or sweet talk someone into doing, though, is entirely up to the gm. I've seen GM's just straight up say ""no"" to even simple fast talk possibilities, under the reasoning that the request is simply beyond the NPC's set of desires.

EDIT: This also doesn't include that there is a lot of overlap in concept which leads to some strange mechanical interaction. If a person using Persuasion uses an implied threat while being mostly positive, is it also intimidation? If omits a bit of the truth, is it also Deception? If I make an empty threat, do I effectively give the player disadvantage by making them roll both Intimidate and Deception? 

I get that a single roll shouldn't wreck the story, but if the system is going to require a heavy skill investment to be effective, then it seems that when the opportunity arises to employ that skillset, a flat refusal or negligible effect might invalidate an entire character concept. 

Now part of that is knowing the kind of game your GM runs and remembering that social skills aren't, in fact, mind control. They're about turning something from red to orange, not white to black, so to speak. But still, if social interaction is part of the scenario, the person playing the face should have some reasonable expectation that they have a chance of affecting the outcome of events, especially if they're good at all of the things required. 

The only other place in the game that I see this kind of over granular approach to a feature is splitting up the Herablist Kit, Alchemist's Supplies, and the Poisoner's Kit into three separate proficiencies when each item only really makes one or three things practically (counting poisons as one option), which again is strange for the design concepts of 5e. 

This is not to say that persuasion, intimidation, and deception aren't three different things or that being good at one means you're likely good at the other two, only that for as general as most 5e skills are, the scope of the three social skills seems really narrow.

I think we could probably roll either Deception or Intimidation into Persuasion and that would be in improvement (and a small boon to Bards and Rogues). I understand I am in the minority on this opinion, but it would at least make things more consistent.

0,0,19,8,"Hi community,

I've just started GMing my first ever campaign and am having a great time creating a detailed homebrew with lots of great history, cultures, NPCs, and an intricate overarching plot of evil forces seeking world domination.

I am playing with three close friends, one I've played with many times, one has played lots but not with us, and one new player.

From the beginning I encouraged them to come up with very detailed backstories and character choices that we could discuss and fit into the fabric of my universe. They did a great job with this, but I'm afraid their deep-rooted character motives are not allowing them to gel as a party and work as a team to combat the primary evil.

The new player is playing an old stubborn Dwarf Monk, lawful good and righteously so, who pictures himself as the leader as he has a large reputation in several cities and his home city was the epicenter for the campaign.

The second player who I've played with before decided to roll an evil Tiefling Warlock who is involved with shady business and often sees fit to murder those in her way. The first time she has played an evil character and the first time I've seen one in a party.

The third player who is quite experienced created a Halfling bard who is a bit of a wild card, and whose humorous behavior sometimes smooths over tense interactions.

Though I've tried to give each character a strong  personal connection to the plot, I'm not succeeding at having them overcome their inherent differences and work together. They are all proud and unyielding in their personalities. They've tried snatching things out of each others' hands, deceiving one another, etc. and it feels bad letting your PCs roll against eachother when you want them to be working as a team.

Last night the party was spending time in a large city full of corruption and hints about the evils at large. The bard was taking her time, as she often does, having long conversations with numerous NPCs in persuit of her own artistic aspirations. I enjoy improvising these interactions and allowing her to speak to whomever she would like, whether or not I already had an NPC in mind, but perhaps there is a way to limit the time we spend on these side conversations without stifling her curious play style too much... That's more of a side thought!

The real trouble last night was when the Warlock and the Monk were questioning a shady NPC for information. The NPC was rude, threatened the two PCs, and was generally unpleasant, but did cough up the information for them. He then proceeded to do a line of cackle powder that the Warlock gave him (a narcotic I invented) and when he passed out the Warlock mercy killed him in front of the Monk. The Monk thought for a moment and then said to the Warlock ""You're no longer part of the mission."" They then, once again, went their separate ways and continued hacking at the plot by themselves.

I had a chance to speak with the player of the Warlock afterwards and she, rightfully so, felt pretty hurt about how it all went down. She tried to stay true to her character and now believes the best option is to have this character leave the ""party"" and to roll an new more agreeable character.  

From my perspective I feel I have totally failed as a GM to facilitate an enjoyable group dynamic and a game wherein the characters all feel safe to be themselves and at least tolerate the idea of working together in this campaign.

I'm pretty beat up about it as I have put so much work and love into the world and feel it's my fault for letting this happen.

Any and all words of wisdom would be appreciated!

Thanks,

BnF

But it feels like there's quite a trade-off -- for one, I'd love to play a Half-elf, for darkvision and an extra skill along with the more substantial stat increases. Or maybe I should be focusing on more battle-ready feats from the get-go, like Sentinel or Shield Mastery. And is one use of Disguise Self enough per day when it really comes down to it?

Pretty new to the game, and I can safely say I'd like to stick with utility unless there's a powerful reason to take something else -- javelins can work fine for ranged attacks it feels, and it'd be great to have a weightier role outside of combat. My other idea was to take a fighter with the same feat, but that ultimately felt like it wasn't capitalizing on their strengths. Also not really into multiclassing -- give me those sweet, sweet capstone wings of destructive glory.

0,0,9,5,"Relatively soon, my party will be exploring a dungeon that I want to make particularly interesting and I could use some help. Its background is fairly simple: the dungeon is a military keep that was ""lost"" during an extraplanar event and now exists in both the Ethereal and Shadow planes. From a mapping standpoint, I am essentially using [Pillar of Eternity's Raedric's Hold](https://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Raedric%27s_Hold), with some [minor modifications](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon). The party is entering the keep in search of an artifact and they know there is some powerful evil entity trapped within the keep. In order to navigate the keep's two versions, they will be given one or more items to allow them to swap back and forth.

The version in the Ethereal is as the keep was just before this event shunted it out of the Material. There are ghosts of former occupants in this version, as well as traps that were set by people trying to prevent the great evil from escaping. Enemies in this version are relatively easy to deal with. The catch is that this version regenerates after a short period of time. Enemies will respawn, traps will reset, doors will relock, and any damage done to the environment will repair.

The version in the Shadow is a dark mirror of the original keep that has been subjected to magical entropic effects. Some walls are missing segments or are damaged while previously permanent magical effects are often suppressed or unreliable. This side is more easily traversible, but dangerous denizens of the plane have taken up residence within, making the combat more hazardous than the other side. Things here do not respawn or reset.

The goal with these two versions is to create an experience where the players need to swap back and forth between the Ethereal and the Shadow to fully navigate the keep, akin to [Titanfall 2's Effect and Cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KntBgBOdeU) and [Dishonored 2's A Crack in the Slab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_JKT2rHg50), just without actual time travel. A Crack in the Slab, in particular, provides something I want to focus on: player agency. Dishonored 2, in general, allows the player to decide how they want to overcome obstacles put before them. I want to replicate that kind of approach with this dungeon instead of requiring only specific solutions (but having one or two specific solutions is not out of the question if enough information can be provided to make it a puzzle of sorts).

So here's the kind of help I'm looking for:

1. What sorts of obstacles can I place that would allow for *multiple* kinds of solutions?

2. What sort of [systemic design choices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpAAX9CkIc) can I make to enable sandbox-style problem solving?

3. How should the plane shifting ability work? For instance, can only one person use it at a time? Does it have a cooldown before it can be activated again?

4. What are some rules abuses you can think of that might trivialize this dungeon and how would you patch those holes?

5. Have I already mentioned anything you feel is problematic? How might you fix such a problem?

6. What other cool things can you think of that might make this dungeon memorable?",dndnext_test,Designing a Dungeon Mirrored in Two Planes?

We're starting at level 3, so going monk 1 / druid 2 also means I won't have 2nd level spells, and this is one campaign where I know the super healing from Healing Spirit is probably going to be a requirement because we played through the first book once in Pathfinder and got roflstomp tpk'd no less than three times.

0,0,3,2,"*Precautionary Warning*

I've been away doing Army stuff for the last 4 months with no one to talk about D&amp;D with, so this may be a bunch of rambling and over thinking... You've been warned.

It's been a very long time since I've been able to play as a character in D&amp;D, as I am always the DM, and I've chosen to play the almighty Bard.  Our party consists of me on bard (undecided), rogue (assassin), druid (moon druid), paladin (undecided tank), cleric (life), and ranger (undecided) and we will be starting at level 5 tomorrow.  I can't see playing any other archetype besides lore because it's so damn good, but two features of College of Glamour caught my eye.  

The Mantle of Inspiration feature for your bonus action not only gives you temporary HP, but also gives you the ability to reposition via a reaction to move your full movement speed and not take attacks of opportunity for all the ranged (Currently me, rogue, and ranger countering disadvantage on attacks for being within 5 feet of creature).  If you get to take a short rest twice a day you get 15 uses of inspiration which is the equivalent of 600 temporary HP (5 targets, 8 temp hp, 15 times) (1050 at level 15) this is not including the spell catnap which lets you take a short rest in 10 minutes.  I know all of that temporary hp won't be used and it will be overlapped for some characters, but reducing incoming damage by mitigation is far more effective then using a spell slot to try and heal the damage taken.  It also allows for any melee that are getting destroyed to back up from a situation and get healed or be able to re-engage a threat that got past them.  I think this has to be one of the most powerful uses for inspiration in the game it eliminates one of the biggest mechanics in D&amp;D that stop people from moving during combat which is actually part of a feat called mobile and could come in clutch in so many situations. 

The second feature is Unbreakable Majesty seems like an incredible way to burn an enemies legendary resistances and avoid the massive late game damage creatures can do for the price of a single bonus action.  They have to make a save before they can even hit you, much like the spell sanctuary, and if they do manage to hit you they have disadvantage on any saving throw they make against your spells on your next turn.  I can only think of one other feature off the top of my head that gives disadvantage against spells and it's the shadow magic sorcerers Hound of Ill Omen which costs 3 sorcery points, a bonus action, and is very easy to kill with 37 hp and 14 ac as it doesn't scale well at all.  

Now I know cutting words is amazing mitigation because it can cause a hit to miss, but Mantle of Inspiration is mitigation for the entire team not just one attack on one party member.  Additional magic secrets at level 6 for counterspell (I also take healing spirit because it's really good) and then being able to use the level 14 feature peerless skill to add inspiration dice to the counterspell check is a ridiculous combo that makes it so you don't have to up cast counterspell ever in fear of wasting 3rd level spell slot or above.  

I also can't decide if riding bard to level 20 is the right call or multiclassing a single level into hexblade warlock, or fighter.  Either one gives access to a shield, medium, armor and all martial weapons which will beef up my bard and open the option for bow use.  Valor bard doesn't have enough in it for me to justify picking it over the other two archetypes mentioned above (unless someone else has a different experience?) so multi-classing is my only way to access the features I want.  

Hexblade warlock seems like a very overpowered level 1 dip, letting you make attacks with the charisma stat, access to the hex blade curse (absolutely amazing feature that comes back on short rest),  eldritch blast arguably the best cantrip in the game, gives you shield and wrathful smite spells, and a 1st level spell slot that recharges every short rest.  It has very good synergy with short rests which ties in very well with the bards inspiration and the use of the catnap spell.  I would almost consider a second level dip into this class just for the two eldritch invocations specifically agonizing blast and devils sight.  

The other choice is fighter for the fighting style (+1 ac or +2 to hit with bow) and second wind.  +2 to hit with the bow is like finding a +2 weapon to me and you can also find bracers of archery to really get a solid +2 and it energizes well with swift quiver allowing you to cast a spell with your action and attack twice as a bonus action effectively making you a better ranger then the ranger is.  

**TLDR**:  Which bard archetype College of Lore or College of Glamour and why.  Also would you take Bard straight to level 20 or dip one to two levels into figher or hexblade warlock.

Class plan: Bard 6+/Hexblade 3+ -- this is where I want some insight. I can't figure out how much of a dip I should do into Warlock, or when to do them. I was thinking of taking a one-level dip straight out of the gate, and then getting to Bard 6 for the extra attack before dipping back to Warlock for Pact of the Blade.

In 3/3.5 (as well as Pathfinder, IIRC?) you literally had to choose between a couple of free Archery feats, or a couple of free dual wielding feats. If you wanted to use a spear or an axe, you were just hamstringing yourself.

In 4e it was pretty much the same; two weapon ranger, archery ranger, or beast ranger.  (No thinking for yourself allowed!) 

5e got a *little* more freeing with ""Fighting Style"", giving you the option of archery, two weapon, defensive (+1 to AC while wearing armor), or dueling (1h only or 1h+shield). But there's no two hand option in that list, which is strange for 2 reasons:   
1) The ""Fighting Style"" feat is shared by Paladins and Fighters as well, and both of them get a ""Great Weapon"" (really  2 handed or versatile weapons of any flavor), but the Ranger simply doesn't have that option.   
2) This might be a personal hang-up, but I find a shield or thick armor to be much more egregious to the concept of a swift woodland scout than I do a two-handed weapon. (*Especially a spear!*) 

Now, I can understand in 5e where two-weapon fighting might appeal from a min/maxing stand point since it would allow you to dump your Strength score and focus on dex, but I still kinda want my ""Aragorn"" ranger with his longsword held in both hands. (Since, you know, you GET a longsword in the starting EQ.) 

So what gives? Is there a reason for this predisposition buried in the older rules somewhere? Is this, like so many things, Drizzt's fault? Anyone got any ideas? ",dndnext_test,Why is D&amp;D always trying to make Rangers dual wield?
0,0,12,4,"I've been pondering artificer builds lately, and while the obvious builds, as far as dealing damage goes, are spells and ranged weapons, I'm wondering what a Strength-based melee artificer would look like. The artificer has some nifty features that could make for an interesting melee combatant. To wit:

* At level 1, artificers have proficiency with simple weapons, medium armour, and shields, plus all crossbows. Nothing too fancy, but it's a darn sight better than being a wizard. Do whatever you can at this level with the gear you can afford.
* At level 2, you get infusions. One very interesting feature of infusions is that you can use any infused item as a spellcasting focus for artificer spells, and you *must* have a focus for all artificer spells you cast, therefore, you can cast spells while both hands are holding items, as long as at least one of them is an infused item. This opens up the weapon-and-shield option, which is normally tricky for spellcasters.
   * One of the infusions you can get at level 2 is Returning Weapon, which means that the weapon (which must have the thrown property) returns to your hand immediately after each attack, as well as being a +1 magic weapon. That's pretty cool for level 2! Put that on a javelin, and now you have a +1 weapon that does 1d6 damage (plus another 1d6 from Arcane Weapon if you cast that), adding your Strength bonus to attack and damage, which can be used to make melee attacks at 5' or ranged attacks at 30' (120' with disadvantage), and acts as a spellcasting focus. Use your second infusion slot on making your shield or armour +1, if you want.
* At level 3, you choose your specialty and hence your pet type. Both are good, but if you're going to spend most of your combats making attacks and casting spells, you probably want the homunculus, which you can summon in the morning and stays around all day, rather than the turret, which only lasts for 10 minutes and takes an action to summon (and another action for the second one at level 14).
   * The turret, while good in and of itself, doesn't really have any synergy with your combat tactics, either, while the homunculus opens up some interesting options. It can hang out next to you and use Help to give you advantage on one attack roll per round, at the cost of your bonus action. The salves it produces can give you temporary hit points for extra tankiness, or give you advantage on ability checks, such as the checks to perform or resist grapple and shove maneuvers. The temporary hit points last until expended, and the inspiration can last up to an hour, so either or both could be applied long before combat starts.
* At level 4, you can think about taking a feat, if you don't just want to buff your Strength or Intelligence.
   * If you take Polearm Master, you can switch from a javelin to a spear, reducing your throwing range to 20/80, but giving you an opportunity attack on anyone who gets in your face. (Oh, and if you thought that the bonus attack from Polearm Master when using a spear one-handed was silly, *technically* you get the bonus attack if you *throw* the spear at someone and it returns. It's a bad strategy, because if there's somebody within range of your melee attack, why are you making a ranged attack, but hey.)
   * If you take Shield Master, you can use an infusion to make your shield +1, so you get +3 to your Dexterity saves (against single target effects, sadly) instead of +2. The bonus action shove is a bit awkward if you wanted to use that bonus action to command your homunculus, but you can use its Inspiration ability to give you advantage on the Athletics check for the shove.
   * Fell Handed, maybe? Use a returning handaxe instead of a spear or javelin.
   * You could go for Great Weapon Master instead of using a shield, but for that, you'd need to multiclass, take the Weapon Master feat, or be a hobgoblin. A greatsword-wielding muscle artificer would also be pretty nifty, and you'd have the advantage of having a guaranteed +1 weapon early on, making you more likely to hit with GWM. No throwing weapon shenanigans here, though.
* Level 5 gets you two attacks, of course, so that's nice.

While you're building up your melee and throwing capabilities, you're using a shield and medium armour, while having medium spellcasting progression, including some healing and damaging spells and some nice utility spells, and you're not burning spell slots on smites like a paladin. It's not the best way to do melee combat, and it's probably not the best way to be an artificer, but I think it has potential.",dndnext_test,Muscle Artificer Casts Spear

The Del Harun are from our Homebrew worlds, The Idea of Samsarras. We have a podcast set there of the same name. My Fiance plays Afsana in this game, who was the first Del Harun character. I have her the think for a lot of this. I'd love to know what you think, especially about the stats. 


Del Harun claim to have ancient dragon blood in their veins. While there are none who can prove or disprove this, it is obvious to those who travel with them for any amount of time that they are not mere humans. These desert nomads ride their horses across the burning sands of Qua’Lorn, resting each night to dream. They carry what they see at night into the day. 

Riders of the Sands, Riders of the Dahlen

To the Del Harun, dreaming life is just as important as waking life. They call the dream realm The Dahlen, and consider their experiences there every bit as real as their waking ones. Although every Del Harun takes their dreams very seriously, they know better than to blindly follow the lessons learned in the Dahlen.

According to the Wise People of the Del Harun, the demons of Samsarras live in the Dahlen. There, they propagate nightmares and false dreams, meant to harm and confuse. This is why the nomads can not believe just any dream they have. If a Del harun has a particularly troublesome dream and wishes to know the validity of it, they go to one of their shamans to have the vision interpreted as to its truth and meaning. 

Blood of the First Dragon

While most cultures see Luln as an evil demon, the Del Harun see things differently. According to them, Luln was the first dragon and he created the Dahlen, as well as the part of it that would be known as Samsarras. His loneliness led to him creating the rest of demon kind, though he would soon find that was a mistake. His progeny were evil and forever hounded the first dragon. Luln took human form and created a horse, endlessly fleeing before the demons. 

Creating the demons did not solve Luln’s loneliness, however. Slicing his torso with the curved blade of his Khopesh, he used his blood droplets to create the Del Harun. Together they rode across the sands of the world he created, battling the demons and finding companionship in each other.  The Del Harun loved Luln and wanted nothing more than to be closer to him. Ironically, this would lead to their separation. 

The Del Harun watched Luln shape reality and they desired the same. They wanted to be like their draconic father. Luln offered them a choice: they could continue to ride by his side for an eternity and live forever, or he would give them what they wanted.  If he allowed them to create as he did without restraint, they would be as powerful as their lord. They would be able to shape the Dahlen in their dreams. 

There would be a price, however. If they would wield those forces,  he would make them mortal so that one day they might die even as he lived on. The Del Harun accepted the offer, throwing away immortality so that they may be visitors and architects in the Dahlen. They believe this is why Elves do not die of old age as they do, for they do not truly slumber. They never accepted Luln’s deal. 

Home is in the Saddle

The Del Harun construct no villages and never stay in one place for too long. Their nomadic lifestyle often puts them in the role of merchants in eastern Qua’Lorn, trading goods from one city to the next for supplies and wealth. They must carry whatever they own, however, so they do not acquire material possessions just for the sake of ownership.

Horses are an important source of pride in their culture, and many can trace the lineage of their animals better than they can trace their own. It is an honor to own a horse from the bloodline of a mythic beast of times past. Such things are often used as rewards for service to the tribe. It is one of the highest honors to receive a foal from the Chief’s own horse. 

Their ability to ride their horses is known throughout Samsarras. There is no other group that may claim a greater proficiency. The best among them have performed incredible stunts for the nobles of Qua’Lorn, earning some amount of gold in the process. It is a rare individual who would call the horsemanship of the Del Harun into question. 

Del Harun Names and Conventions

The Del Harun claim to be descended from bronze dragons, and point to their golden brown skin and green eyes as proof of this. Their hair ranges from dark brown to blonde. The nomadic lifestyle of the Del harun often leads them to have weathered looks, as the desert sun, wind, and sand toughen the skin. 

The majority of Del Harun tribes are patriarchal, with the position of Chief being passed down to the eldest son along blood lines. Each tribe also has a War Chief who is expected to take over in times of physical strife. Traditionally, the Chief verbally hands over control to the War Chief, who then returns the tribe to the Chief after the tribe is safe. This is not always the way of things, however. 

Aside from the Chief and War Chief, each tribe also has a shaman who is well versed in the Dahlen. It is left to them to interpret the important dreams of the tribe, as well as administer healing and herbs to aid in sleeping and dreaming. Some few have even possessed magical abilities, though that is the exception and not the norm. The shaman will generally train their successor, taking on an apprentice when they recognize someone has the aptitude. While the shamans are mostly women, it is not a gendered position in any official capacity.     

The Raven’s Claw tribe has inverted the usual structure of Del Harun tribes, with women taking on all of the leadership roles. Because of this, women from other tribes of Del Harun have been known to leave their people to join the Raven’s Claw. The men of the tribe ride, fight, and live alongside the women. While recognized and celebrated for their contributions, they are never given positions of prominence.  

Most tribes see heterosexual monogamy as a default, though all orientations are accepted. The exception again is The Raven’s Claw, where homosexual polyamory is the norm, especially among those of the tribe that identify as women. None of these cultural norms are law, however.

0,0,20,1,"Hi All,

TL/DR:  I see a lot of compelling reasons to take a Padlock to Warlock 2, but don't see much return in Warlock investment beyond that.

Currently slugging through CoS as a 6/1 Vengeance Pally/Hexblade.  I should hit my next level within the next couple sessions if XP progression remains relatively consistent, and I've been wanting to start mapping out character progression over the next 5 levels or so.  In doing so, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to justify taking anything more than 1 more level in Warlock.  I wanted to get some feedback on this, make sure I'm not missing something.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Case for Warlock 2**

Why go to 2 at all?  Why not just take the single level dip? Eldritch Blast Invocations.  And no, not even Agonizing Blast.  I mean Repelling Blast and Grasp of Hadar.  I'm relatively surprised I don't see this discussed more often, but the ability to move an enemy around the battlefield against their will, and with no save or recourse of any kind, I find to be extremely powerful and strangely underrated.  There have been so many occasions in this campaign alone where I would've killed to have the ability to throw someone back 20 feet, or drag them in 10.  Blasting enemies out of windows to thin the numbers, utilizing environmental features and effects for fun and profit, synergistic shenanigans with other party members (my druid pal's Wall of Fire comes to mind pretty readily).  I find the utility of forced movement to be hard to overstate.

&amp;#x200B;

Compounding this usefulness is the natural mobility of the Vengeance Paladin.  Presumably you have your Found Steed active at all times (I do).  That's 120' of movement, requiring precisely none of your own action economy, per turn.  You ought to be able to line up about any kind of shot you could need to with that kind of mobility.  Indoors?  Mount died?  You still have Misty Step.  Not nearly as far, true, and resource intensive, but if you can take that pesky caster out of the fight by blasting him off that precipice it's probably money well spent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also of note is the fact that all of this movement occurs *on your turn.*  So unless the target has some spell or ability they can activate as a reaction, they're going to go wherever you put them and there isn't a lick they can do about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the case of repelling blast, the movement utility of the invocation continues to scale with character level so you see a continual payout.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple all that with one more short-rest spell slot and one more Warlock spell, and I think there's a very solid case to be made for 2 levels in Warlock. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Case Against Anything More**

&amp;#x200B;

Quite simply it comes down to resources.  It goes without saying that Paladins depend heavily on their spell slots.  An investment beyond Warlock 2 simply doesn't provide enough of them to justify the level progression IMHO.  Consider, if you choose to go Pally 6/Warlock X, you will have a total of 8 spell slots *from character level 8 all the way to character level 17*.  And you will never see any more than 9, provided you character arc even takes you that far.  And yes, you have some short rest slots, *but it's only 2 of them* for the bulk of your playing career.

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, if you go Warlock 2/Pally X, you'll hit 9 spell slots at character level 9, 11 at CL 11, etc.  By the time your Warlock X hits 9 total spell slots, Pally X has 14.  So he has 5 more spell slots and 2 of them are still on short rest.  

&amp;#x200B;

And all of that is to say nothing about Pally 6/ Warlock 2/ Sorcerer 9 (the most logical choice in my mind).  That beast has 18 (!) spell slots, access to 6th level spells without being restricted to one, and all the fun of meta magic to go with it at the same CL the Warlock from above gets his 3rd spell slot.  

&amp;#x200B;

So what else are you getting for all that investment in Warlock levels?  Invocations, largely.  Invocations are cool.  They add a lot of utility and versatility to the Warlock class.  Barring the 2 discussed above, however, I'm not sure that they add a lot to the Padlock multi-class.  Consider that a lot of the more interesting ones for a melee-focused, in your face build don't really come online until Warlock 5 (CL 11 in this example).  Are any of them more valuable than the 3 more spell slots the Pally X has at this CL?  Or the access to meta-magic that a Sorc 3 could get here?  I'm not convinced that they are. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not to take anything away from the idea of Invocations.  Again, for a pure Warlock, they add a lot of versatility.  But as a Padlock, I don't need to speak with beasts, or disguise myself, or create illusions.  Those are other people's jobs, and they are going to be much better at those jobs that I would be.  My job is party face, primary or secondary tank, and boss killer.  There just isn't a whole lot in the Invocation tool kit, in my opinion, that makes me that much better at my job that it would entice me to give up the advantages other character progression paths provide.

We'll be posting a new issue every month  from January to June.

You can find the third issue, *Sourceseekers*, on [DriveThruRPG.com](https://drivethrurpg.com/) right now, introducing the **Way of the Third Eye** for monks and **Ancestral Magic** for wizards.

*Way of the Third Eye:* Meditating  deeply and mastering mind over matter, monks who train in the Way of the Third Eye gain extra-sensory perception, telekinetic prowess, and  incredibly resilient bodies. They eschew physical combat techniques, but they are rarely outmatched in the ring thanks to their enhanced mental state. 

*Ancestral Magic:* Wizards who study Ancestral Magic learn magic the old-fashioned way, favoring patient rituals over flash  and spark. Their spellbooks are filled with curious glyphs and long-forgotten seals, and they can eventually blur the barrier between arcane and divine magic.

We're really proud of the work and would be delighted if you checked it out and let us know what you thought! There's a full preview at the link above so you can read over the archetypes, and enjoy the awesome art our friend Frank ([@gaugex](https://www.instagram.com/gaugex/)) did.

Big picture: Be the most versatile unit on and off the battlefield. The number of things one can do in this game is in the same ballpark as real life. This build wants to capitalize on the ""do almost anything (within reason)"" mechanic that's very much present in the game. In my last campaign, I don't think I got clever enough with everything I could do in a given situation, especially pre- and mid-combat strategy. Now I want to run a build that's all about that.

""Why necromancy?"" One of the easiest ways to die in this game appears to be getting outnumbered in units (and in damage, obviously).  The Necromancer portion of this build is meant to either turn the numbers in my favor, or see to it they don't shift out of favor (more numbers = more tactical advantage). Besides, the spell targets were already dead. They didn't need those bodies anymore, right? The Necromancer sub-class also patches the E. Knight's abysmal slot count, dumping 1,000,000 spells into my pool in the process that I can swap out when I level in Fighter. 

Personal fighting habits:

· Aim to be keeping a distance by default. The spell selection is how I'm going to do this.

· If something gets too close, it's getting smacked. Hard. Great Weapon Fighting helps raise the odds of getting good rolls.

· Charge in when advantageous. If something sees me approach, it should expect to die.

· In relation to the above, I have the most important buff spells I could want: Longstrider, Haste, Jump, Featherfall, and should I ever need it, Greater Invisibility. The first two or three on that list alone with Action Surge and Multi-Attack (x2) make rush down strats early- and mid-combat 200% nuts (***slices in TORANZAMU***). Use GI for more unseen approaches, and Featherfall in tandem with the other buffs for when you want to achieve your dream of being a cyborg ninja who runs along walls and jumps on targets.

· To be clear, the previous point contradicts the first point a little in that being the first to dash into a space of enemies can be a great strat.

0,0,0,0,"So I took many of your suggestions into account and I think this is the game/rules were going with. Any other suggestions are still welcome!

Game
Your goal is to kill the enemy team. Each team has a dragon egg that hatches into a young dragon (young black dragon, but they’re black/white). One egg is black, one egg is white. The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.

4 Zones

Forest:
Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, creatures feel their brains begin to rot. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 INT save, take 4d6 necrotic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, they fall prone. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Caves
A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the caves. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 4d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, their movement speed is halved for the turn. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Rocks
This area has a rocky surface with massive boulders jutting up from the ground. When a 3 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, an image of the players worst fear appears hovering in the air above the zone. Creatures in the zone need to make a DC15 CHA saving throw, take 4d6 psychic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail they become frightened of the image. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Tower
The tower sits on a grassy surface, but the tower itself is 50 feet high and made of solid steel. The north and south sides of the tower have a hemp rope from top to bottom, and the east and west sides of the tower have metal chain ladders. A random level 6 spell scroll spawns at the top of the tower, and refreshes every three rounds. When a 4 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a lightning storm. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 4d6 lightning damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

~~~~~~~~

Fountains
In each forested area, there is a fountain of regeneration. It has a pool of 200 health it can restore to those who drink from it. You can only heal at the fountain on your original side. You can damage the fountain to drain the remaining pool of health it has left. Fountain is immune to psychic damage, and has resistance to all damage besides magical bludgeoning damage.

Flames
The entire back walls are magical fire. The team with the black egg has white fire, and the team with the white egg has black fire. This flame cannot be extinguished. Each player holds a magical bottle to capture some of this flame. When the flame is brought back to the egg of its respective color, it reduces the turns to hatch by 1. Players cannot hold more than one bottle at a time.

Death Slaad
The Death Slaad begins the game on top of the tower. It will begin the game pursuing the closest player it can see. The Death Slaad knows if someone is touching his tower, and will pursue them and ignore others for as long as they are touching it. It has 250 HP. The Death Slaad has a mind control gem implanted in its head and is being controlled by someone outside the arena who's spectating.

Other stuff
- Walls surround the arena with a ceiling 100 feet up.
- Players have x1.5 health.
- Each player has one legendary save die. Once during the game, players can use their reaction to roll a d12 and add it to a saving throw or your AC in response to failing a saving throw or taking a hit.
- If a player dies, they become a mummy.
- Your magical bottle to capture the flame can also hold 10 HP worth of healing water from your fountain. It cannot hold healing water and the flame at the same time.
- Hide and Readied actions are banned.

0,0,16,0,"I know, I know, rules for multiclass spellcasting are in Chapter 6, and the rules say you determine what spells you can cast based on the rules in the individual casting class. Bear with me here.  Chapter 6 brings up the possibility of multiple casting classes giving you spell slots “of a higher level than spells you know or can prepare.” The argument I would like to make in this post is that you actually satisfy both these conditions: You *know* the spell, since it’s in your spellbook, and you *can* prepare it, based on the particular wording of spell preparation in the Wizard class.

What wording am I talking about, specifically? In Chapter 3 the Wizard class gives the following guidelines for preparing spells.

1) They must be in your spellbook.

2) The spells must be a level for which you have spell slots.

That’s it. It seems to me, then, that a Wizard who had Fireball in his spellbook and had a 3rd-level slot to cast it with should always be able to prepare it.

The argument of general/specific might come up, so I will say this: The rule of “when in doubt, defer to the rules of the individual class” is a general rule. Furthermore, there is nothing in the Wizard class that forbids this interaction. So it seems to me to be a-go.

Hey guys, I tried this out with my group last night and they got a kick out of it and thought I should post it.

Basically as a DM, trying to speak for monsters, I could never come up with decent ""gibberish"" for the goblins, orcs, etc. to be saying. I wanted to make something that would fix my problem, and work quickly.

So here it is. Feel free to save as and make any changes you want. Simply input the phrase in common and what language you want and the 3rd cell will be the translation.

The second sheet has the simple excel code I used to accomplish this

Basically, I assigned each language a number and then to ""translate"" I had excel shift each letter back that number of letters in the alphabet (keeping vowels as vowels and consonants as consonants, I also changed Q's to Y's because they caused some issues)

I hope it helps someone! and all I ask is if you find something cool to add to it or something, post it on here so we can all use it!

For background, I’m a half-elf Circle of the Land (Forest) Druid. I have no plans of multiclassing. My WIS is currently 16 (+3 mod). I think I’m going to forego the ability score improvement and instead take a feat. I’ve been eyeing up the War Caster Feat, as I like the fact that I get advantage on concentration checks and I can cast a spell as an attack of opportunity when enemies flee. Only thing is, I typically don’t use weapons in battle, so my hands wouldn’t be full when using somatic aspect of spells.

If you're trying to scavenge for items and materials, and that's one of the center-focuses of the campaign, being able to shove a wooden chair into a magic bag removes that element of fun. Smash the chairs, place in bag, and now we have plenty of wood to survive the next winter. Instead of thinking, how are we going to bring back these two bears we just hunted, it's now cut'em up, place in bag, continue hunting.

If you don't have a sled, or a car, or some way of moving a large slab of meat, then you're forced to think.

Now, I understand one of the big upsides to a bag of holding is being able to store the party's dragon-hoard's worth of a gold, but if that's the only reason you're giving your party a bag of holding: Why not give them a ~~Bag of Coin Holding?~~ Coin Purse of Holding? Make it the same as a bag of holding, but only have it store coins. You could even specify further that it can only hold copper coins or gold coins.

The common joke of the players stealing everything that isn't nailed down like it's a video game is made 10x easier with a bag of holding... and there's nothing wrong with that. Your average game isn't going to end because the wizard carries around a library's worth of books.

There's plenty of ways to give your players a bag of holding without changing the game.

The players kill the dragon, but you want to have an excuse as to why they would stay in the lair for an extra few days? What if bag of holdings were *super* common? Imagine if everybody with money had a bag of holding because of how easy they are to make... but they only work on Sundays. Everybody's buying stuff like mad and the banks have a line leading down the block, because this is the one day out of the week when everybody's Bag of Holding works. Sure, you *can* make a bag of holding that works 24/7, but they're so expensive only the rich can afford it. That could be why the party has to guard the lair for two days. They're waiting for their bag to open.

There's a bunch of ways you could customize the Bag of Holding to fit your campaign world if the idea of the standard one seems too overpowered for you.

0,0,20,155,"I'll keep the backstory as short as possible, but I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.  Running a campaign for my kids and extended pseudo-kids and they released an evil possessing entity because kids are dumb (""The book is evil.  It will possess anyone that reads it. It has the potential to unleash something terrifying if the wrong person reads it. You should destroy it."" ... ""I'm going to read the book!"" ... ""Sigh. Make a new character, your old body is the big badguy for the rest of the campaign""). This thing is trying to turn them all evil for obscure reasons, and in a solo game convinced my daughter to murder a kid.  The line went something like, ""Hey see that kid in the cage?  If I hadn't brought you here and showed you the goblin camp they would have eaten her.  And look how many goblins there are!  They're going to attack the town, you know.  If you murder that kid, I'll totally take care of these goblins for you. And the kid was going to die anyway."" and after doing the deed when everything started swarming with goblins she tried to bust out her wings (Protector Aasimar) and I said, ""A dark energy flows over you as skeletal wings sprout from your back"" and she was very sad, pointing out that she had only killed the one child.  Sorry, guess one was your limit!

&amp;#x200B;

So now her and four of the others are on a malfunctioning planar craft turned laboratory turned evil monastery, floating hundreds of feet over a valley.  They charge into the prison area to liberate a few of the party that had been captured, she lets off a fireball that wipes out almost all the guards after confirming it wouldn't kill the prisoners, and the day is saved.  Then one of the NPCs they rescued says ""What about the ones out back?""  So she charges out back and finds all these prisoners on this platform over the void, some sort of loading dock thing, and it's all corroded and ready to collapse.  There are two fenced-in docks, and a conveyor is dropping crates onto the one because it's glitching out... because it's on fire.  Whoops, her fault.

&amp;#x200B;

So she runs to the other platform and the controls, which lock her in once they're activated.  She can switch which platform the stuff is being dropped onto but hers is, if anything, in worse shape.  I make it clear there are only two options because there's no time for anything else - leave the settings as they are and watch all the prisoners die, or switch it and she dies in their place.

&amp;#x200B;

So as I hit ""one"" on my countdown she switches it over and the big metal crate lands and smashes her platform, and she starts falling.  ""Anything to grab onto?""  ""Just stuff that's also falling.""  She looks at her character sheet, there are no spells that will help.  One of the other players asks if they can throw her a rope, but there's no way to throw it faster than she's falling.  She looks pretty distressed.  ""Damn it, if I had my wings... you know... I just saved a bunch of people... can I try?""

&amp;#x200B;

""A pair of radiant wings sprout from your back.""

She's SO excited.  She is thrilled that she's no longer a Fallen Aasimar, AND she gets her big hero moment of saving the prisoners and then flying up out of the void.

&amp;#x200B;

But of course, none of that was actually in the module we're doing.  And someone else could have been the first one to run out, or she might not have set off a fireball that could give me an excuse to have the device malfunctioning, or they could have thought of some other way to stop it, or she could have figured out what I was doing before making her choice (thereby making it meaningless), or a million other things.  But it worked out just like I planned.  Maybe next time she'll think twice about listening to evil soul-eating monsters wearing her friend's skin.  But honestly, probably not.

So this Thursday I have two games coming up.
That's nothing unusual, but through scheduling issues of some members cabt make the usual time.

So now both games start at 5.


You can probably see where this is going...

The first game has a very invested DM with a colourful homebrew world that is fun to explore. The players are great at their RP and interacting with every character is fulfilling and fun.
The actual mechanical aspect is a little lacking, fights are sometimes drawn out and some spells and abilities feel nerved to add realism.

The second game is a ToA campaign where the DM gives out magic items and XP like candy to kindergarden kids. The characters are a little cliché and rough around the edges. The players seem like they are not always on the same team but work well when we actually sit down to develop strategies and co-op moves.
Spells and abilities work exactly as written which leads to one or two cheese-strategies which the DM happily allows in this high magic setting.
Next session we are going to hit lvl6 and then jump straight into a heist sequence. Needless to say, I'm excited.

A spellcaster starts level 1 by choosing just one school of magic and only uses the spells from that one school. The homebrew is this.... 

I cut the spell list down to 24 spells for each school of magic. There is also the same number of spells at each spell level. So each school has the same power structure and number of spells. For example, each school has 2 cantrips, 3 spells at spell level 1, and 4 spells at spell level 2.

The number of spells and spell advancement are the same from school to school. That way, each school is as enticing as any other school. So no school of magic really has an advantage over another school by having more spells. The magic schools are all equal.

I'm looking at my options for a Chaotic Evil character, with the theme being ""will rip apart and eat slain humans with its bare teeth"" and similar. Lizardfolk is the first that immediately comes to mind, but I'd like to explore my options and make an informed decision. 


My initial thoughts are: 


- [Simic Hybrid, Orc, Minotaur, Hobgoblin, Goliath, Goblin] have that ""is human-like, but I could still see them being cannibals"" vibe. 


- [Shifter, Naga, Lizardfolk, Kobold, Khenra, Dragonborn, Bugbear] have that ""further from human-like, and I can see them eating people alive"" vibe. 


- [Kenku, Aven, Aarakocra] are bird-people, so they have their own flesh-tearing vibe. 


So I guess I'll try to briefly break-down my impression of each: 


---


Whole of first category: They're a step-up from Human, but none of them seem ""bitey"" enough. 


Bugbear: A bigger, more intense version of the goblinoids/orcs. I think they'd be better at tearing raw flesh off of freshly-slain enemies with their teeth better than any human could. 


Kobold: A smaller Dragonborn/Lizardfolk. 


Aarakocra/Aven/Kenku: Bird-humanoids with big beaks. A solid option, but I'm not feeling the beak theme right now. 


Shifter: Animal-themed humans. Hard to say they're be more bitey than a Bugbear, flavor-wise, but mechanically they're definitely an option. 


Naga: Snake-where-the-legs-normally-are. Mechanically a very cool option, but flavor-wise I'm honestly not sure. Depends on how snake-like they are, I guess. 


Khenra: Dog-people. Solid option for theme.


Lizardfolk/Dragonborn: They're different, but there's some overlap in theme. Especially considering the lore behind the Lizardfolk, these two are very solid options.

0,0,10,5,"I'm doing some pre-planning for a handful of adventures that:

* Start in Tier 2
* Last 12-15 hours (should be 3-4 sessions for most tables I'd think)
* begin in media res

A 3 - 4 session adventure that starts in Tier 2 isn't all that controversial and seems to be a bit of a hole in the market when it comes to published content. What I'm concerned about is the adventure starting mid-stream. 

The way I plan to execute it. The short premise surrounding your immediate situation is explained, where you are and what you've been through is briefly explained. And then the floor collapses (as an example) or, imagine Lost Mines of Phandelver but the first session opens with arrows flying through the air at the ambush scene.

The biggest downside I can think of is there isn't even a cursory chance to meet and establish a group, but if everyone at the table accepts the conceit that they're already a party, that can be handled. To further deal with this I've been considering a system where at certain points in the story a player or players get a ""Why are you here?"" or ""What have you been through on this adventure so far?"" moment where we pause for a moment, then the DM rolls on a specially authored table to feed the PC their improv hook.

0,0,6,1,"I would like some opinions on a half-orc monk if you have played them before. It's supposedly AL legal (point buy + restricted race and class) and we're starting at level 1. I want to see if I can make him stand out; he doesn't need to be optimized, but at least not falling behind by a mile. Right now I have two concepts for such builds.

The backstory is that a half-orc comes across a githzerai and sees parallel between the duality of the gith people (because I love the story from Dakkon in PST) and that of his own heritage, inspiring him to take the monastic tradition.

1. I was planning to go for a pure Str Based Open-handed monk but the errata last year made it obsolete. Since a stunned creature automatically fails all shovel or grapple check then there is absolutely no reason to rely on strength any more. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this, I would love to bring the concept back. Else I might as well run a pure Dex/Wis open hand Half-Orc monk (10, 15, 16, 8, 15, 8) with more rounded stat. It's not a bad idea but I can see myself struggling for the first 4 level because I lack that +3 for Dex and Wis.
2. The next concept is to multiclass; if I want to utilize the Str bonus and to stay at front line, I could dip barbarian for HP, rage and resistance, but I have no idea what to do after dipping so I'd like some opinions on how to do it.

My current thought process is 16, 14, 14, 8, 14, 9... Barbarian for the first two levels, then roided monk all the way through. It'll either be way of the kensei or shadow since my DC and Ki pool will be lower than monk of the same level. Kensei synergies well with Savage Attack and agile parry can help with the AC, but I will suffer Ki shortage due to the barbarian dip. Shadow is... nice if I'm planning to take on a mage. I can cast silence, jump through the shadow and get close then hammer them, but that seems very situation-specific and doesn't offer me anything else. The obvious downfall is that when every other class get a huge boon at level 5 (extra attack etc) I'll obviously get left behind.

0,0,5,0," DnD players of reddit, Do you have any stories of a session where you just weren't interested in something or just weren't feeling it and if so how did it go?

Context: I'm an older DM who is playing in a game with a bunch of people younger than I am by almost a decade. The DM of the group is a friend of mine who plays in a game I run and basically since my character is mostly there for fights he comes to me for advice on how to do certain things he wants to run in the game. He came up with the idea for a bar fight he wanted the characters to go through.

Fast forward a week or two and its game night. Instead of going to a bar, he's decided to do the whole thing in a flash back. I'm not crazy about flash backs because they tend to lack any sense of consequence since you're just going to fast forward back to the current time at the end. I decide to give it a chance and to my surprise the entire party is present (6 or so characters) except my pc.

My friend the DM then tells me he couldn't think of a way to get my PC in the flashback (Since he joined the group later) so he had a random NPC for me to play. At this point I wasn't interested at all in doing that. I don't like bar fights, I'm not a fan of flash backs, and I really had zero interest in playing a random NPC I had no attachment to.

I just flat out tell him to do his thing, not to dwell on it and to just get it over with. He tells me he doesn't want me to feel left out and I just blurted out ""Then why didn't you include my character? If you didn't want me left out you should have tried harder to find a reason for me to be here instead of handing me a random dwarf, hell you could have just said I was here getting a drink myself on a totally unrelated errand that would have been better than giving me a random NPC."" I'm pretty sure that upset him, and I just told him to drop it and carry on and that I'd wait for the bar fight to pass since we had a whole session ahead of us.

Well the bar fight goes on for two and a half hours, he's not letting guards get involved, he's not ending it any kind of quick even though some of the other players are trying to get it over with he's enjoying it, he's just dragging it out to the point that it's looking like the entire session will be a flash back bar fight and I just drop off discord without saying anything since they are all still playing I don't want to interrupt them and my character isn't there anyway. I messaged another player to tell him whats up so someone knows without me interrupting the game.

However, a small piece of Atropus' ""eyes"" (black stones that emanate negative energy) survived and was taken by a necromancer named Varkos.  Varkos used the shard of Atropus' eye to make himself an incredibly powerful lich, essentially an elder evil, capable of bringing an age of darkness and death upon the world.

0,0,21,1,"There are plenty of places online where you can find people asking about what spell slots actually are, which is to say, what they represent in game as an abstract mechanic. I’ve seen plenty of answers, but one thing I’m curious about never gets brought up: how do people justify the levels of spell slots?

If I’m playing a high level wizard, and spell slots are being treated as some kind of energy I’m expending (for example, as this is one of the many answers I’ve seen as to what they are), then spending most of my spell slots would render me weak in terms of that magic energy. However, the last spell slot I have available could be a ninth level spell. This would make the following statement entirely true: “with all that remains of my power, I feebly cast... the strongest mortal spell in existence, wish.” That just seems screwy to me.

Of course, it’s possible to expend high level slots casting lower level spells, and I’ve seen people integrate this into their answers. They say something like, “a ninth level slot is the same magic energy as a lower level slot, it just represents spending more of it to cast a more powerful spell.” Which is frankly bullshit, pardon my language. Maybe you could describe spell points like that, but slots are distinctly different. If that were the case, I should be able to spend part of a ninth level slot for a first level effect, and then perhaps end up with an eighth level slot remaining. But that isn’t how it works. Using a ninth level spell slot on any spell requires spending the whole “thing” at once, whatever it is that “thing” is.

I’m not exactly looking for an official game answer here. I don’t think one exists beyond setting specific vague lore I don’t find satisfying (if you think I’m wrong on this feel free to post examples). I’m mainly interested in seeing how other people have thought about this issue in their own games. What, to you, is the nature of a “spell slot” in your game? What kind of “thing” is it?

&gt;We want to inherit a monster slayer guild and get it up and running again. We also want this to be a railroad, not a sandbox. Please just throw interesting monsters at us and don't expect us to steer the game into unknown directions.

Well, then, okie dokie. As I was brainstorming the best format for framing the small excursion-style adventures that would comprise this escalating series of ""let's just kill stuff"" encounters, I still wanted to come up with a narrative that grounded the concept and helped make the threats of local monsters feel a bit more holistic than ""grr, arg, slay it."" Then it hit me--make the old monster slayer guild and nearby town like Sunnydale, California, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and slowly insinuate that there is some sort of ""hellmouth"" below the region which is constantly spitting out bad stuff or otherwise influencing the territory in warping, evil/chaotic ways. My thoughts then went to, say, an old cathedral or fortress buried underground following a \[reason\], which is now filled with alkiliths. Per MTF:

&gt;The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to that plane.

So, the hellmouth was easy enough to replicate in-game... basically, we've got some old ruin under the mountain whose windows and doors have been overtaken by fiends capable of opening steady portals to the Abyss. Cool. But so much about Buffy is not JUST the big bad plot, but also the wonderfully-flavorful monster-of-the-week episodes that churn up so many interesting baddies and the ways to resolve them. I've also been reading the wonderful Monster of the Week RPG out of the Apocalypse Engine, as the concept of cinematic hunters against the big bad world is captured very well there.

* What favorite Buffy-verse encounters should I include? How should I do it?
* What would be great cross-overs in terms of using D&amp;D monsters and plots as analogues for Buffy monsters and plots?

VAMPIRE
---

Vampires are not truly undead, though its quite easy to understand the misconception. Incredible lifespan, deathly pallor, unearthly features, sensitivity to sunlight, and a thirst for blood define the vampires of Szitensa. 

In their homelands, they operate with a hierarchical aristocracy, and cultivate a somewhat cult-like society within the populace of the ""lesser"" races of their lands. While the populace lives in fear of their wrath, it is considered a great honor to be chosen for your blood and welcomed into their luxurious court, and even greater still to be ""sired"". The vampires, for their part, adhere to a (somewhat twisted) code of actually maintain a fairly peaceful and secure rule, disliking outside disruptions to their ""cattle"", and rarely killing a good source of blood when they feed- at least not right away. 

Vampires divide into two major groups: Trueblood and Sired. Truebloods make up the aristocracy, and are born if union between two vampres; Sired vampires are former mortals (mainly humans, though others exist) turned by a vampire.

Lifespan: vampires live an extraordinarily long time, with the eldest among them being over 1000 years old.

Alignment: thanks to their rigid society and parasitic nature, vampires trend to lawful evil

Speed: 30 ft walking

Darkvision (the kind tieflings have)

Ability score increase: your charisma score increases by 2

Necrotic thirst: your fangs can serve as a melee weapon. They have the finesse property, and deal 1d4 necrotic damage. Additionally, a successful bite heals you equal to 1/2 your proficiency modifier. For each week you go without drinking blood, you suffer a point of exhaustion

Sunlight Sensitivity

Beguile: you can cast Charm Person once per day without expending a spell slot. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Languages: you speak common and 2 languages of your choice



TRUEBLOOD
---
ASI: your intelligence score increses by 1

Vampiric Flight: you have the ability to fly via a dark magic. You have a fly speed of 30ft as long as you are not wearing heavy armor and are not encumbered

Xxxxxx

Obviously it needs cleaning up and language brought in line with standards. I also need to figure out what Sired vampires do, to make them appealing against, yknow, flight. I know i want them to get their ASI bonus to strength. 

As for what i used as a guide for balancing this, i looked at Aaracockra. They get 50ft fly speed and a d4 natural weapon as well. I feel like the sunlight sensitivity (and the lesser fly speed) is enough of a downside that i could even add something else beyond the charm person, but iunno.

0,0,9,3,"I've recently been giving thought to running a game with a Combat as War and Old School mindset in 5e D&amp;D.  Giving players an open world and a goal of being capital A Adventures  exploring a fantasy world and being the best heroes they can be. I'm curious about people thoughts on the combat as war/old school mentality and there thoughts on a game like that.
-
-
-
-
To summarize the Combat as War philosophy: There is no assumption that combat will be balanced. If PCs aren't careful, they can easily find themselves outmatched and killed. If they prepare appropriately, they can evade combat completely, or turn it into a turkey shoot.
-
-
-

1.Encumbrance (PHB p176)
a)If your carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.
b)If your carry weight is in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

2.Rest Variants (DMG p267) Slow Natural Healing (DMG p267)
a)GRITTY REALISM This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to engage in too many battles in a row. and all adventuring requires careful planning. This approach encourages the characters to spend time out of the dungeon.

3.Training to Gain Levels (modified from DMG p131)
a)Characters must spend a long rest meditating, training, or studying to focus their gained experience into tangible growth and development. Doing so costs 20 GP per level in materials and training.

4.Visibility/Noticing Other Creatures (DMG 243)
a)While exploring, characters might encounter other creatures. An important question in such a situation is who notices whom. Indoors, whether the sides can see one another usually depends on the configuration of rooms and passageways. Vision might also be limited by light sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, weather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely to hear one another before they see anything. If neither side is being stealthy, creatures automatically notice each other once they are within sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, compare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as explained in the Player's Handbook.

5.NPC/Monster Loyalty/Morale rules 
a)Monsters and npc's may flee when the situation looks dire for them.
b)https://www.neuronphaser.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-morale/

6.Random Encounter Tables
a)If an area is likely patrolled, the party is being hunted, or if there is a chance for an encounter random tables will be rolled upon.

7.Researching Monsters and Challenges
a)In a game like this Information is much more valuable, and I’d rather make information more available than less.
b)Being able to research a dungeon, monster, or area is something that will readily available to your characters. That could mean a Wizard scrying or using a library, or a ranger scouting the woods and conversing with animals or people to gain useful information, or a barbarian intimidating a criminal for info on the bandit hideout, mix and match and find out what your enemy is.

8.Henchmen
a)Henchmen rules are too long to post but here is a link to the article i modified. Henchmen are player characters that cant be higher than 1/2 player level and you can have a minimum of 1 up to your Charisma mod henchmen.
b)http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?486788-5e-Henchmen-Rules

a)Players will be placed in a world for them to make there own. With a loose direction to bind them together. The ability to construct keeps, run businesses, sponsor other adventurers, and anything else your character can think to do is available to them.

10.Limited Resurrection
a)The resources necessary to resurrect someone are rare to the point where they are often the objective of entire adventures, player characters are limited to 1 resurrection in there lives.

11.Long term Injuries
a)When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright.

a)Building keeps, starting businesses, etc.
b)Buying magic a magic item
c)Crafting, Gambling, Pit Fighting, Relaxation, Research, Politics, Selling a magic item, Training a skill, Working a job, etc.

14.Strict Time Keeping
a)The DM will keep an accurate calendar and mark days as they pass.
b)The DM will do his best to mark the passing of the hours as well and keep track of the time of day. 

15.DM as a neutral judge of rules
a)This requires a bit of trust. I don’t want the adventurers to lose, I like it when you win in fact seeing players beat real challenges is fun for me. But the challenge comes from setting a real problem for the players to tackle and to do that I must remain an impartial rules arbiter.

16.Enemies will fight with strategy and tactics

To start of, my three players are all level 13, decked out in a fair amount of magic items and trinkets. At the start they were supposed to fight a bunch of cultists of demogorgon and a dragon fused with an ""eye of demogorgon"" a magical gem that had meshed two dragons into one (a blue and a brass), i used angry GMs [paragon](https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/) monsters for it, basically two adult brass dragons sharing one body with the only change that one could use a lightning breath to represent the blue side. 


But due to clever uses of silence, magic items and a few good deception rolls the cultists lair was taken apart easily and noone of the cultists had a chance to summon in any demons to help and they quickly fell to the players. After that they descended on the twoheaded dragon and quickly put that down too. After the fight was done the fighter had ~15 HP left and the monk and warlock was both above half, they then proceded to check out the rest of the lair for any magical trinkets and coins they missed. 


But when they went out of the lair the brass dragons mother, an ancient brass dragon, demanded the eye of demogorgon for safekeeping, shortly thereafter an ancient blue dragon showed up and did the same. 



Now here is where things went wrong i think, my assumption was that they would side with the blue since they had a ""you help me i help you"" relationship, they stole a book for her and in return she gave them safe passage through her domain or that they would just drop the eye and let the dragons fight over it while they ran away. But we all know that no plan survives contact with the players. 


A battle started, but the blue dragon that also is a high level spellcaster got the upper hand fast when she casted imprisonment on the brass dragon, she then took the gem and decided to teleport away. In that moment my players decided to run up and grab a hold of her. Through all of this she had basically ignored the players since her only goal was the eye. But once she was back in her lair with the players she gave them another option. Stand down, walk away and i will let you live, i just want the eye! 

My players decided to fight her some more. After a few turns with a breath attack, and some claw attacks and with the party still standing, she decided to end it. She cast meteor swarm, the warlock is down, the fighter falls down, the monk is still standing but is quickly killed of with a tail swipe. 

The part is dead, its a TPK, my first ever. 


At this point im frantically thinking of how to salvage the situation, this wasnt even supposed to be a battle, they had all the chances in the world to walk away. So i did something, i deus ex machinaed a solution. She dumps the bodies quite a bit outside her lair, they lay there for a day or two. And then one of the barbarian tribes that they saved previously finds them, resurrects them and thats where we ended the session. 

Was this a good way to handle it? They knew from the start that they were outmatched by any of the ancient dragons and that their best option would have been to run away. I talked it over with the warlock player on my way home and he agreed a bit. It was a very convenient thing to happen that the barbarians showed up, but he also voiced that he thought they should have fled the battle since they knew the blue dragon was powerful. 
We talked over it a bit and he said its nice to ""be alive"" and that he understood why the dragon killed them and also why i deus ex machinaed a resurrection since noone really wants to reroll a new character. But i dont know. It just feels a bit cheap somehow.

Unfortunately, the establishment was suffering a union riot.

After making it inside to the welcome desk, my players saw a plain, wooden obelisk next to the way towards the next room. The obelisk has a single circular hole big enough for an arm. The obelisk also has writing around it saying things like ""Bet you're too scared to stick your arm in!"" or ""Only REAL adventurers are brave enough to stick their hands in!"" They also heard the odd sound of ""Cheep cheep cheep"" like a chicken calling out to them from some unseen shadow.

We went several sessions and he was not able to retrieve a viable sample of a powerful enemies blood. But he had some extra money that fellow adventurers in his party needed. 
That's when he started to pay characters for their blood when they needed extra money to buy items. 
So far he's acquired the blood of a few other players including a human paladin's blood and a wood elf sorcerer's blood. 
Is there anything rule wise or any fun ideas of what another players blood could be used for involving magic, flavor, or even ritually concerning the archfey?
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I should note that using the blood is just a flavor thing and shows a genuine misunderstanding my character has involving the medallion but now that I have all these vials of other player blood what else can I do with it?",dndnext_test,"Concerning blood, magic, and rituals"

I would like your advice on a problem I'm considering  


Sounds like it would be a good idea to not allow dragonborn as a race. Yet I don't want to limit the freedom of my players so much. How would you implement a dragonborn PC considering the presence of a dragon worshipping kobold tribe?  
I mean the RP potential is great, but how will Yusdrayl, the kobold leader, react to a dragonborn? Will they be simply frendlier or will they submit to their new overlord? The more I think about it the more I feel like the problem might be in my head alone. Surely Yusdrayl has seen dragonborn adventurers before and knows well that not all of them are to be trusted.  


She could interpret the presence of a dragonborn as a godly envoyee to rescue the dragon Calcryx and help the tribe to take finally over the whole citadel. As much as she could smartly doubt them and treat them not differently from other adventurers.  


How would you deal with this situation?

Thank you very much!

I'm playing a game this coming Saturday with a group of four starting at level two. Two of the other players decided to play casters, a wizard and a warlock. The third player is thinking of either paladin or rogue.  Since that covers damage, I was thinking I should play something that forms a front line and provides healing. 

I'm planning to play a variant human and picking up the healer feat. Besides that, I thought a heavy armor cleric would fill the support/healing and ""stop the bad men from hitting my friends that wear dresses"" role. 

The tempest cleric seemed really good, but I wanted to motivate enemies to hit me and not my allies, so the thorns damage seemed counter productive. I chose War then because I only have the PHB and that's the other one that wears heavy armor. I decide to wield a shield and hammer because defense seems good and the mages should cover the damage. 

I plan to mostly cast support spells (bless) and melee in combat, relying on the healer feat before spells for healing. 

Are my basic assumptions of the group needing more people in the front and needing healing correct?  Would a different role/class/domain suit the party's needs better?  Also, can I even cast and use the healer feat action if both my hands are occupied?",dndnext_test,Is a war cleric the right fit for this group?

0,0,7,0,"Hi all,

First time playing dnd (or any rpg with an emphasis on the rp) and could use some advice. 

Recently one of my friends (TG) got seven of us together for a campaign. We're all fairly new to dnd - TG has played in a campaign and has a set of the rulebooks, DM vaguely knows about the premise and is a first time DM, I have wargaming experience so I'm familiar with mechanics but less familiar with rp, and the rest are fresh newbies who were hooked more by rp than mechanics (they were introduced by naddpod, a comedy dnd podcast).

TG is super helpful with getting everything set up and helping everyone with stat sheets, as well as helping the DM get oriented. TG plays a CN rogue. First few sessions go really well - we're all friends so we're all having fun stumbling our way through rp and combat; TG does typical CN stuff like trying to hide gold he found from the party (he didn't manage to hide it; we all give him shit for it, hilarity ensues). 

Last session, we started after we killed our first named boss atop a tower (fairly easy, TG and I both have relatively min maxed characters and DM is still tuning challenge ratings for our group) and finished a long rest. TG resummons his owl familiar, which our bard immediately grabs and chucks off the tower, presumably as a joke. TG declares pvp and stabs the bard for more than half his hp in one hit. Luckily, we rp'd our way to deescalation and headed back to town. 

This is worrying to me - when I asked why he didn't just have his familiar take a dump on the bard's head, he said ""it's what my character would do - actually, I should have just kept attacking until the bard was incapacitated"". TG has a fairly min maxed character, a half elf rogue with an owl familiar from a feat (we all got free feats at lv 1 at his suggestion so he wouldn't be forced into variant human for his build), and he put his half elf ""+1 to two other abilities"" both into dex (despite what sage advice says, I know, but when I brought that up, he said ""Mike Mearls isn't the rules guy, I would only agree if Crawford said that""). Sure, when it comes down to it it can always be homebrew, but when it's being used to allow someone to overpower a newbie's pc then that seems problematic. 

Anyway, anyone got any advice on dealing with (preferably with rp methods) this sort of thing? I'd rather not have things going down the ""pissed off CN becomes loner"" path as at the end of the day, we all just want to hang out and have fun (also we actually like TG). On the other hand, I'd also not want a game where everyone is afraid of defying the CN in case they get 2-shot by a min maxed pc.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently decided to give my hand at D&amp;D

&amp;#x200B;

 \-Awhile back, I had a very very brief introduction after being invited to a party of some online friends; which quickly went sour immediately following the first session..unfortunate 

&amp;#x200B;

Skip forward to the present... I jump on the DM bandwagon, and got some coworkers in on the action! At first, I was appointed to try DM'ing a few dungeons, and maybe some small home-brew quests to get my 'sea' legs so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately for me, our first session day happened to be on the same day I got paid! Dropped over to my local hobby shop - looked around, and picked up some extra die, vinyl grid mat, and the D&amp;D 5e Starter Kit... last moment, decided to run the Lost Mine of Phandelver adventure. Everyone was pretty stoked to play, myself included to DM it! All has been going prettttyy well, having 2 sessions in one week, and will most likely be 2 this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

There were a couple times where reading, and making notes were a little tasking - usually only when my players were deep in discussion, and I could listen in, making notes about what they could decide, and what their choice could do to the adventure; rather, where I'd end up in the book. (I originally looked at it too linearly, and now just keep it on the side, flipping from part2 to part4...part3, back to part2 as story, or the Players call it - though always trying to nudge in the right direction if I think they might miss something they'd enjoy/benefit from)

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------&gt;As a bonus read - one of my favorite parts was a Short Rest I made them take...wasn't written in the story, but I felt it necessary to get their RP'ing ball rolling. 

4 of the 5 are completely new, one of my players having already played a few times, just for reference. 

One of my PCs wanted to go hunting...rolled really well for his hunt, got a clean kill, which I described to be what seems a very large Rodent (think wombat) - He then passed it over to our Rogue for a skinning (he being Half-Orc) .. she rolled a CLEAN 20 +4 (survival used for roll as a quick ""too drunk, roll for this to see how clean the skinning is)... skinned this creature like never before and got everyone a healthy 8oz cut, which she then rolled survival again for stewing the meat up instead, and rolled a nice 18 +4. 

After everyone had 'eaten' I gave the table an inspiration point for awesome role-play...INSANE rolls for a nice hunt/meal... and even added on top what I called a Status; ""Full"" which equaled 4 hours (in game travel/fight time etc) of +1 to STR rolls. 

\----------&gt;Continued funny story (I'll make it brief)

I threw in a little perception/stealth situation for them near their area of short rest 

\- they all unfortunately very badly bombed the Stealth rolls (checking some clearings in the woods), I then just threw in that one of our PC's, on her terrible roll of 2 (and mod) caused her to trip and hit her head on a small rock - 'roll your d4 for damage please' &lt; instant sadness with howling, and laughing from the rest of the table... 

Thankfully she only grazed the rock, taking a small goose-egg on the back of her head, dazed but no worse for ware. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: DM'ing is fucking great - hilarious - engaging (for me and my players &lt; naturally pretty creative and inspired) I'm looking forward to continuing our wild ever more confusing, and fun Campaign. (also helped me get away from my PC gaming habit...still there albeit very seldom..)

.....everyone is getting along wonderfully...though a few too many brews can bring some very deep, arduous discussion..fun none the less lol.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW - I'd like to ask....any tips/tricks/explanations on some maybe tricky mechanics I might eventually encounter? For instance, saving throws fucking wrecked my brain trying to understand exactly WHAT kind of spells/poison situations/etc etc.... Anything and everything you've got to offer is great, and much appreciated.

I  described the ritual with some fanfare, but since I have a lot of players, I didn't give it a huge lead up. It happened, my SO was excited, I read out their new abilities.

Last session my group had involved us fighting a big general-type character whose armor gave him resistance against physical attacks (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing). The barbarian in our party has a magic axe that does fire damage on top of obviously being a magical weapon. 

My question is this: Do the resistances from the bad guy’s armor still apply to the magic weapon attacks made by our barb? Our table was a bit confused because although this situation had happened before, we had never really discussed it. 

Side note: The Fandom Wiki (which I think is fairly reliable) says this: 

“Typically, if a creature is resistant to a weapon damage type unless it is silvered or adamantine, they are also not resistant to the normal damage from magic weapons.”

Druids would be much more popular if in the class features it listed them as knowing the spells ""summon wolf pack"", ""summon frenzy of sharks"" and ""summon swarm of giant bats"".  

Then the subclass is named ""shepherd"".   I assumed from the name it was the healing subclass,  shepherds take care of things. 

Rename the subclass beastmaster or packmaster or king of the beasts, then you would have people lining up to play it. 

Mechanically shepherd druids are amazing,  but their marketing is terrible and you have to read a class,  subclass, spell list, spell, beast list, and beast stats to discover this. ",dndnext_test,The problem with druids - specifically shepherd druids

I ran a session today where, at the end of the session, I felt kind of like I'd simply run the PCs through a series of events that moved the plot forward, but didn't give them real options aside from what they did within the several encounters.  

Here's what happened:

1. They started fighting a Morkoth from their ship. Due to heavy story reasons, their actions caused a rift in the Material Plane about 40 feet above the ocean's surface and the Plane of Water started spilling out into the ocean, complete with Sea Serpents. A trusted NPC said ""Let's get out of here!"" and they did... 
2. They arrived at a familiar city, and were being led through the city streets by a guard to see the City Council (expected) when a strange monster was seen attacking a woman in an alleyway. They fought it and defeated it. Again, this was an important story point (that these kinds of monsters have made it into the city). But it felt a little hand-holding.
3. They went to see the City Council and were scolded (as expected), then sent away. 
4. They then ran into an important NPC who was shot by an assassin when he was talking to them. They located and took down the assassin, and learned more information from both the assassin and his NPC target.

  
So my concern is that they didn't have a lot of agency during the session. Once we rolled Initiative for each encounter, they could choose how to use their combat and other skills to fight the Morkoth or the Lost or the Assassin, but the rest felt like I was simply shepherding them through the events in order to have those encounters. In other words, I felt like stuff kept happening TO them rather than by them.  
Does anyone else have this problem? Or this concern? Or advice for how to avoid this?

0,0,14,0,"So I'm currently playing a lvl 6 Aasimar ghostslayer bloodhunter in a group of 5, and despite only playing a few sessions I'm rapidly losing interest in the character and having very little fun.

First of all, the rest of the team is comprised of a cleric, wizard, ranger, and warlock. Essentially everybody but myself is either a caster or at least a half-hour, which is why we felt that I should opt for a martial clase despite initially being hesitant as I very much dislike martial classes and especially martial melee classes.

One of the reasons I was hesitant to play martial was becuse I always liked the idea of each character having a particular skillset they could lean into and have time to shine with, but given the setup of the team and the choice of races and classes, pretty much every skill was covered. Hopeful I'd find my own in combat and be able to lean into that and RP, I built the character and got into it.

After 5 sessions, I'm finding myself more and more disappointed each time I play. Because of a series of comparatively poor stat rolls, the rest of the group is sporting 18 in their main stats while I'm still sitting at 16's, with some others not even being too far behind my scores in my main stats  So in combat, I find myself struggling to find a use  The cleric is both a better frontliner than me with their plate, and a better pair against undead which I feel as supposed to be my specialty. The Ranger and Warlock hit just as hard as me with Hunter's Mark/Hex, far more reliably, and with range to boot. Of the entire group, my character is the only one that's gone unconcious, and numerous times to boot.

It's gotten so bad that the DM has been not so discreetly dropping Homebrew items tailor-made for my character: a weapon of speed so I can use my bonus action for something .ore often, and chain that gives melee attacks a 30ft range to let me stay out of the Frontline, bloodhunter armor that let's me cast haste on myself. I know she means well, but every time we get out of a fight with everybody looking fine and my character stumbling out only to receive a consolation prize, i just feel like my pride and the entire concept of this grizzly seen-everything warrior takes a punch to the gut 

Normally I'd try to lean on RP here, but as luck would have it everything I was hoping to evoke with my backstory has also been overshadowed. The ranger is a far older, far more veteran warrior. The celestial warlock has a far deeper connection to the gods. The teifling wizard has a far more fleshed out connection with the dark forces of the eorld.

Combine this with the fact that my characters skills are always overshadowed because there's always somebody better at all of his skills in the party, and the fact that all of his story is just a lesser version of other players stories, I get less and less invested in the RP as time goes on. It got to a point last session where I lost all track of pacing and blurted out my entire characters backstory before it's had a chance to come up, effectively killing the last remaining shreds of interest I had in continuing to RP that character.

I keep thinking of bringing this up with the DM, b cause I'm just not having fun even though I really am trying, but it's gotten to the point where my character has just devolved into something I'm not proud of, don't like, and don't enjoy playing: a joke. Ii want to stress that the DM and the players are all great people and great friends of mine, and none of this was their intention but moreso poor planning on my part. This is why I'm so hesitant to bring it up - I don't want to cause problems for the DM and the other players by inconveniencing them, I just want to be able to enjoy playing with them and I currently don't.",dndnext_test,"I feel inferior and useless in my party and don't want to seem like a powergamer or diva by bringing it directly up with the DM, what should I do?"

0,0,216,242,"I was reading I think the Alexandrian and came across a bit about why rolling 3d6 (or even 4d6 drop lowest) was an ideal way for players to discover their character. As usual I recoiled viscerally at rolling for stats. At my tables we always use point buy or standard arrays. It got me thinking, why do I feel so emotionally upset at the prospect of rolling stats (especially in order)?

I realized because that’s what life did to me and I play DnD to experience a simulation of a life more exciting and just downright better than real life. 

Life rolled 3d6 in order for me and everyone else. Im blessed it gave me an 11 or 12 or something in Intelligence. But the 5 or whatever it gave me in Constitution and all my chronic illnesses? Fuck that. Especially when, I selfishly and enviously, see people who rolled 18s or what have you in their stats. 

Life is unfair. I hope that I can make efforts to make it more fair for the people around me, but I know life is capricious and random. DnD is random. It literally involves rolling dice. But when it comes to who I am in this fantasy world, that randomness hurts. Just for this fleeting moment, it’s beautiful that my hero and my friends’ heroes all have the same array/point buy. We are all different. I am a nimble charming rogue whilst my friend is a powerful and wise healer. But in our differences we are equal. 

DnD is a fantasy. I want it to involve challenge and even heartbreak. But to roll 3d6 in order? Fuck that. I live in a world that does that and I hate it. 

EDIT:

to be clear:

I understand the value of 3d6 in order and that for some games/tables it is a good idea. 

It’s just that I have such a visceral reaction to it and I had an epiphany of sorts of why.

As our characters level, how do we thematically explain how our characters obtain these new fancy skills and abilities?

In regards to divine casters I think its a bit easier, for example:

You awake the next morning after a dream of your god (or what may have you) coming to you and blah blah you realize you have access to this new spell with the ability to know the somatic and verbal parts needed to cast it.

In regards to my future Kensei monk however, how would I explain that after X amount of weeks traveling with this group of people, he wakes up the next day and realizes he can speak and understand all spoken languages (Tongue of sun and moon)? Or the fighter realizing he can shoot an arrow that literally banishes the creature to another plan of existence (Banishing Arrow)?

0,0,5,1,"Hi

This is my first post here but I thought I'd ask the internet for advice. I plan to run a home brew 8-10 session adventure starting level 6. This is when 9 classes have subclass features for extra flavour and because we've never managed to get beyond level 5 before GM fatigue sets in.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting equipment is an issue, especially as magic items which influence build decisions. There is also the whole artificial ""you found the perfect item to fit your character"" issue that happens which can be bypassed to some extent by starting with it (if it's uncommon).  The DMG seems rather stingy and whilst I don't want magic items to be commonplace, it's nice to provide mini power-up rewards mid-level (which will be milestone-based, none of this ""we better solve this by fighting for the XP"").

&amp;#x200B;

Below is what I came up with and I would really like the experts to pick holes in it, find broken builds etc. I have avoided uncommon items that I think should be rare like Winged Boots, Broom of Flying and Helm of Telepathy, as well as more situational items unless there is synergy/thematic resonance with the class (e.g. Monk and Water Walk). I have also used the common items in XGE to simplify purchasing high ticket items (200gp+) so that spending budgets are less onerous.

&amp;#x200B;

My main worry is some of the items are simply my evaluations - very few people will have encountered all these items in 5E versions. So there may be items that are just too powerful that have found themselves onto the list. Most classes get 1 really good item to attract that kind of player. Want to be a Blaster? Go Sorcerer with Wand of War Mage +1. Want to be a Controller? Go Wizard with Wand of Webs! That's why I simplified some of the choices to ensure players don't turn down the obvious item in that class list. I also wanted Weapon of Warning to be rare, for 2 weapon fighting or Bladesingers (and you can always use a Moon-Touched Shortsword in the off-hand as a magical weapon attack).

I will explain to players they need to ensure they have a magic weapon or damage cantrip to bypass numerous monsters with non-magic weapon resistance (there are also lycanthropes and golems with their immunity). And this helps explain why the general populace need their help. It helps that Monks &amp; Moon Druids also gain magical natural attacks at level 6.

&amp;#x200B;

Having no multi-class helps (a ranger, the weakest level 6 feature, will be given the ideal favoured enemies and terrain for this one-shot adventure). I dislike abusing front-loaded features via multi-classing (envoy war-forged war wizard 5 forge cleric 1, yuanti vengeance paladin 5 hexblade warlock 1, all exercises in ""how optimised can I build""?). And I've taken into account Hexblade or Valour Bard + Heavy Armour feat etc. But not every eclectic build is catered for. The idea was more to focus on a really strong theme for each class and ideally a few of players will take the fluff common items for RP fun.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my questions:

* Are there any items above that can be abused?
* Are there any items above that are trap choices? Replace with what?
* Have I missed out items (max. uncommon) that open up level 6 builds?

My group had been playing Storm King's Thunder for almost a year and a half now, and after some crazy shenanigans we fought the last battle today against Iymrith, her two kids, and a bunch of purple wormlings today.  

Before the final battle, we got the Wyrm Claw and a potion of Giant Size.  Our leader, the Druid, got the Claw and my Sun Soul Monk, who does the most damage in melee, got the Potion of Giant Size.  So my DM really hates the Sun Soul Monk class.  He loves Monks, but the Sun Soul makes him angry because it can be a ranged monk, keeping the monk out of front line combat.

He played the Way of the Fist Monk in another campaign and he loved that character in combat.   He said it was high risk but high reward.

So, I'm pretty sure he did things to persuade me to go up and punch shit instead of spaming Hadoukens from 30 feet away.  Things like my character finding the Ilde Rune and him ruling I could add that extra D6 of fire damage to my punches (but specifically not the Hadoukens) and the Charm of the Slayer to my punches as well. I'm pretty sure that was because that feature annoyed of the class annoyed him so much.

Because of this, with Flurry of Blows, my damage was averaging about 45 per turn, out damaging the casters, fighter, rogue, and ranger at level 12 because it was consistent damage (20 points automatically if I make all four punches didn't hurt and my rolls are generally pretty decent). 

Now back to the Potion of Giant Size.  Normally it increases Strength, but he changed it due to my character being a petite wood elf, upping her Dex to 25 instead as well as tripling the amount of dice for each strike.

We got an army together and Harshnag (my monk's buddy - she was one of two people in the party who could speak giant, she actually knew what Force Gray was due to a good roll, was the one to first approach him to talk to him, and probably had the most interactions with him) to fight the dragons.

It was suggested that I didn't just gulp the potion right away (which in hind sight I should have, it would have made the entire battle easier).  So we killed the two adult blue dragons.  It was a fairly easy fight considering we were fighting two dragons (and I happened to double crit on a round of Flurry of Blows, which didn't hurt either).

Then of course Iymrith is pissed because we killed her kids, bursts out of the ground, and wrecks the party, knocking us back.  Poor Harshnag falls underground with the wormlings and we can't get within 20 feet of her because the ground around her is pretty much gone from her bursting out of it.  My now Giant Sized Wood Elf Monk has to throw some hadoukens, which was kind of hilarious when you think about it because they still did the normal amount of damage.

However, our druid leader had a great plan and managed to give us ground underneath the dragon again, bringing Harshnag into the fray once again as well.  Iymrith is still wrecking shit.  She kills our sorcerer to the point where he's failed two death saving throws.

Finally it's my turn again and Harshnag, our Fighter/Bard, an NPC Ranger (who is the GREATEST, but that's a story for another time), and I have flanked her, and our table has ruled that gives us Advantage if we're flanking an enemy (also gives enemies the same advantage as well).  I do Flurry of Blows with advantage on each of the four strikes.

Every one of them hits.

After I roll a lot of fucking dice I end up doing 141 points of damage, which was enough to finish the dragon.

But holy fucking shit, 141 points of damage as a giant elf literally beating a dragon to death with her fists.

I don't know if I'm ever going to top that in combat again.  I might have to retire as a melee player and switch to casters for a while, because holy shit I had a Kaiju Battle with a Dragon And Kicked Her Fucking Ass.

And, even more hilarious, my elf is super young.  She is literally just 18 years old.  Everything else is just going to be downhill from that. 

She is totally making a cape out of Iymrith's scales though to wear.

I basically so far made him a Variant Human with Magic Initiate (for Guidance cantrip and Shield of Faith spell). With sword, shield and heavy armor, I have base AC of 18. Originally I had planned on picking the Protection fighting style, but I realized that with the build I was going for once I hit levels 3 and 4 I would have too many spells fighting over that one reaction.

Once I reach level 3 I'm picking up Shield, Absorb Elements and possibly Blade Ward. The entire playstyle I wanted to have was of a defensive/utility oriented character. But with so many abilities fighting over that reaction, I thought maybe I should switch to the Defense fighting style instead for that +1AC. If I do so, my concern becomes another one: What if the DM starts to make monster just ignore me since my AC is so obscenely high? (If I'm casting Blade Ward on myself or using cantrips during my actions, I will likely have my sword sheathed so the somatic components of spells isn't an issue even pre-War Caster). Then sure, I would have 19 base AC which could go up to 21 with Magic Initiate's Shield of Faith and then 26 with Shield of Faith + Shield.

However, he had a DMPC, our rogue, whom he had wanted to kill for months. So his set piece cinematic involved this rogue selling his soul to the goddess of luck for a stacked Deck of Many Things. He divined the nature of the lich's phylactery, spawned an amulet of planes to allow the rest of the party to escape, then destroyed the deck and himself at the same time. We were all very moved by his heroic sacrifice. After being transported to Bytopia, the god Garl Glittergold granted us a spelljammer ship to return home, as a sympathy gift.

0,0,12,12,"So I took many of your suggestions into account and I think this is the game/rules were going with. Any other suggestions are still welcome!

Game
Your goal is to kill the enemy team. Each team has a dragon egg that hatches into a young dragon (young black dragon, but they’re black/white). One egg is black, one egg is white. The egg hatches after 10 rounds. The egg is the size of a basketball, and gives off a high pitch screeching noise that’s audible within 50 feet. The noise cannot be suppressed. Each team can hide their egg on their side before the game starts. The egg can be destroyed with 10 hits from a weapon. While attempting to complete these objectives, a neutral Death Slaad will be hunting down the players.

4 Zones

Forest:
Very dense vegetation, paths have been cut through. You cannot see through or see out of the vegetation, but you can move through it like difficult terrain. When a 1 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, creatures feel their brains begin to rot. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 INT save, take 4d6 necrotic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, they fall prone. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Caves
A wall of stone shoots up to the ceiling 100 feet up. Tunnels are carved through it. There is no light in the tunnels. When a 2 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, arctic wind blasts through the caves. Any non-magical flames are extinguished. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 CON save, take 4d6 cold damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail, their movement speed is halved for the turn. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Rocks
This area has a rocky surface with massive boulders jutting up from the ground. When a 3 is rolled in a d4 at the beginning of the round, an image of the players worst fear appears hovering in the air above the zone. Creatures in the zone need to make a DC15 CHA saving throw, take 4d6 psychic damage on a fail or half if they succeed. If they fail they become frightened of the image. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

Tower
The tower sits on a grassy surface, but the tower itself is 50 feet high and made of solid steel. The north and south sides of the tower have a hemp rope from top to bottom, and the east and west sides of the tower have metal chain ladders. A random level 6 spell scroll spawns at the top of the tower, and refreshes every three rounds. When a 4 is rolled on a d4 at the beginning of the round, the entire area is bombarded by a lightning storm. Creatures that begin their turn in the area must make a DC15 DEX save, take 4d6 lightning damage on a fail or half if they succeed. This lasts until the beginning of the next round.

~~~~~~~~

Fountains
In each forested area, there is a fountain of regeneration. It has a pool of 200 health it can restore to those who drink from it. You can only heal at the fountain on your original side. You can damage the fountain to drain the remaining pool of health it has left. Fountain is immune to psychic damage, and has resistance to all damage besides magical bludgeoning damage.

Flames
The entire back walls are magical fire. The team with the black egg has white fire, and the team with the white egg has black fire. This flame cannot be extinguished. Each player holds a magical bottle to capture some of this flame. When the flame is brought back to the egg of its respective color, it reduces the turns to hatch by 1. Players cannot hold more than one bottle at a time.

Death Slaad
The Death Slaad begins the game on top of the tower. It will begin the game pursuing the closest player it can see. The Death Slaad knows if someone is touching his tower, and will pursue them and ignore others for as long as they are touching it. It has 250 HP. The Death Slaad has a mind control gem implanted in its head and is being controlled by someone outside the arena who's spectating.

Other stuff
- Walls surround the arena with a ceiling 100 feet up.
- Players have x1.5 health.
- Each player has one legendary save die. Once during the game, players can use their reaction to roll a d12 and add it to a saving throw or your AC in response to failing a saving throw or taking a hit.
- If a player dies, they become a mummy.
- Your magical bottle to capture the flame can also hold 10 HP worth of healing water from your fountain. It cannot hold healing water and the flame at the same time.
- Hide and Readied actions are banned.

When I got a 5e starter set as a Christmas gift three or four years ago, I had the idea that I could DM a game for my kids by just staying a few paragraphs ahead of them in the adventure. (I had a REALLY good DM back in the day, who made it LOOK easy.) Between my utter lack of prep and trying to apply old school rules to a 5e set (""wait, what? Your cleric can use a pointed weapon?"") you can imagine why we didn't make it past our first afternoon.

We've played a lot as players in a campaign in the last year, so now that I have a feel for 5e I thought I'd take out the boxed set and try to DM again. I've done a LOT more prep, including reading lots of amazing posts on running LMoP here on Reddit and I think we're ready to go. I figured I probably put in six hours of reading and prep for the first section, which should probably take the players two to three hours to get through (to the end of the Cragmaw hideout.)  I'm assuming DMing gets a little easier as you go, but would you say that's about right? A couple of hours of DM prep for every hour of player game time?  I think I might be a little over-prepared, actually - I wrote up combat blocks with key stats and spots to track initiative and hit points for all the expected encounters, plus a bunch of other cribbed notes from various posts I read. Then again, I don't know anything about the spells my wizard and ranger players can cast, so I'll have to be looking them up on the fly.

The party got the Black Dragon Mask away from the Cult during Hoard, which if I’m reading the text right means that Tiamat CANT come through because Severin doesn’t have the completed mask. But that seems kind of anti climactic...

(Leaning towards taking 14th level Rogue for the Blind sense, but I don't know if it would be good spell slot-wise, and if it's needed since I may take 'Alert' as a feat instead of an Ability Score increase)

**3rd question:** Should I start as a Bard, reach 6th or 7th level, then switch to Arcane Trickster for the remaining 13 or 14 levels? Should I do the reverse?

**4th question:** Are my priorities stat-wise correct? What about which Features and Ability Score increase I should take? Which chosen Proficiencies and Expertise? (Definitely taking Stealth Expertise)

0,0,15,0,"Druids get a lot of hate from people. They regularly appear low on everyone's tier list, and they are empirically the least played class. But they are fantastic. There are 3 reasons for this.

1. Wild shape is incredible. As a Moon druid it makes you the best tank and disabler in the game, edging out barbarian depending on opinion, and definitely at level 20. For any other circle it gives you an insane amount of flexibility anyway. You are now the best scout in the party, you now have every movement option (burrow, climb, fly, swim), you now have possibly the best disguise in the game outside a shapeshifter, you have an escape skill, you can break into places by turning into a spider without even needing to pick locks, and you can do it all twice on a short rest. Your very existence invalidates the party role of half the other classes. It is also the reason that Druids are probably the best one man party.
2. You are a full caster with a solid spell list for support.
3. Depending on DM ruling/on how kind your DM is in letting you influence, they have access to probably the two best spells in the entire game: Conjure animals (for 8 stags) and Conjure Woodland beings (for 8 pixies). This is a bit questionable, but even if your DM gives you other animals this can still be incredible, particularly as a circle of the Shepard giving them magic attacks and tripling their health with bear spirit.  


The only thing that they aren't good at is blasting. Their damage is fine (almost on par with fighters at low levels minus action surge) but not phenomenal (unless your DM is kind with animal selection for summon animals). But almost every other class does that to some degree. Further, I would encourage you to consider damage not in terms of damage/turn but rather in terms of damage before you die. Druids win the second hands down, even if their nova isn't so good.

In terms of subclasses, Moon and Sheperd are incredible. Moon makes you a godly tank. Shepherd makes everyone a godly tank, including the 8 minions you summoned at level 5 (looking at you bear spirit).  

Some of you are probably thinking ""derr druids are great this is such a pointless post."" This post isn't about you. This is just a post for anyone who hasn't played druid or who thinks they are bad. They are not. They are fantastic, and you should try one.",dndnext_test,Druids are Top Tier

0,0,4,0,"I want to beef up Nezznar to make the final battle a bit more memorable as I've been dorking with some of the rest of LMoP (one of my players has played it before) and I want to make sure that I'm not cranking up the volume too much on the final fight.

I've googled around a bit and saw a couple other people have subbed in a drider and messed with other things as well to make the Nezznar fight less underwhelming. I've decided to make this a two-stage fight with Nezznar transforming into a magic-enabled Drider after he and his spiders (making this a phase spider and giant spider instead of 4x Giant Spider) are killed.

The party consists of 5 players who will likely be level 5 by this fight. If they're level 4 I'll tone down the fight a bit

### Phase 1:

Nezznar (CR 2)

Phase spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/phase-spider) (CR 3)

Giant spider [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider) (CR 1)

Quasit Familiar (still debating whether or not to have this, might be a bit tricky) [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit) (CR 1)

If I do include the quasit I'd have it disguised as a tarantula tracking the party throughout the dungeon with a couple opportunities to spot it and eliminate it for this fight. Additionally, it will void the contract with Nezznar as soon as he goes down (doesn't matter if the spiders are still up).

### Phase 2:

Magic-enabled Drider [stat block](https://i.imgur.com/QE2ZT39.png)

Any spell slots spent in previous stage remain spent. Kept his ""mental"" stats the same as the previous stage.  I've been debating nerfing the HP, or possibly keeping him at lvl 4 spellcasting instead of upping it to 5 (a little worried about vampiric touch, but counterspell would be fun). I'll probably give the party a very brief respite between the two phases (not a short rest but the cleric *could* cast cure wounds once or twice).

My players have also been both a bit loose with their resources and quick to flee and rest so I imagine they'll find a way to get to this fight with either much more or much less resources than expected of the fight.

### DMG CR Estimate for drider vs modified drider

Drider:  
Defense CR: 10 (19 AC: 17, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (28.5/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13: 0)  
Overall CR: 6  

Magic-enabled Drider:  
Defense CR: 7 (17 AC: 10, 123 HP: 4)  
Offense CR: 4 (21-32/round: 4, Bonus +6: 5, DC: &lt;= 13 &amp; concentration: 0)  
Overall CR: 5 (maybe a bit lower because of the lack of spellslots from the first wave and dependence on keeping vampiric touch concentration up for the higher damage output)

Nezznar could put out 32 damage per round if he can keep concentration on vampiric touch, but damage falls pretty quickly without that (down to offensive CR 3). I'm not too worried about it being too easy because they'll have just survived the previous fight so they should be pretty haggard by this point.

So that leaves me with one CR 6 (maybe 7) and one CR 5ish encounter right after the other with very little downtime. Is this okay? Any advice? Am I going to kill my party with this or is it relatively balanced?

&amp;#x200B;

In my upcoming campaign the party is investigating the underground depths of a massive superstructure known as the Citadel. After grinding through a planned 5-floor-deep dungeon, they will end up triggering an eldritch seal on the Citadel that causes them to be transported into a different realm. There, they will meet an ancient warrior who essentially guards this primordial force of death, a mass of the souls of everything that has died in this world, keeping it trapped underground beneath the Citadel, and that their breaking of this seal will cause this primordial force of death to eventually break free and wreak havoc on the world (dun dun DUN!).

In short, they learn of a ritual where those who trigger this seal are able to get a shot at taking the power of this force of death for themselves if they manage to get their hands on sacred artifacts held by the previous adventurers who broke the seal. However, as punishment for breaking the seal, the party members are also branded by a curse that grants them immortality, at a cost. Every time they die, they resurrect after 1d8 + (number of deaths) hours. However, each time they come back they suffer a temporary stat penalty which can be cleared by taking a long rest, though with enough deaths these penalties become permanent, with the seventh and final death causing them to go permanently insane and die for good. 

I'm wondering if anyone's tried a mechanic like this in the past.

Soulbound 
These weapons are soulbound to you during a ritual cast by an other worldly being. To work; this ritual requires the sacrifice of two magic weapons and the owners soul. As a result the magical weapons are destroyed and the owners soul is scarred, reducing one of their stats by 1.
Once complete the weapon's binding will leave a bonding point (rune/mark), with no fixed point, on the character's body as proof of the ritual. The weapon will be made of soul stone after this point, consisting of any color, texture and shape the owner wishes. All magic imbued into the original weapon is carried over to the soul-bound form.
Any Soul-bound weapon can be summoned instantaneously, in hand, as a Reaction, at the will of the owner. The owner may disband the item and have it return instantaneously to the void or bonding point where it's rune/mark is left on the owner. The weapons may be any distance from the owner and still respond to their call. They must remain on the same plane as the owner or they will be returned to the bonding point. Soul-bound weapons can never damage their owner, if such an opportunity occurs the weapon returns to the bonding point.While you wield this weapon, you also have resistance to the relevant damage type.

While wielding one dagger, the user may throw the other as a bonus action, after which the user will instantly teleport to its location, catch it, and attack the nearest creature. If you hit with this attack, the dagger deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage. A flurry of raven feathers are left at the previous location.

Dragons Breath
You imbue yourself with the power to spew magical energy from your mouth twice a day(once fire once cold). Until the spell ends, you can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

I was reading some of the D&amp;D Beyond Encounters of the Week, and found one I rather liked; [A Tale Too Far] (https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/419-encounter-of-the-week-a-tale-too-far). Basically, an NPC ""holds the party prisoner until they entertain him"", and they get a reward for it.

I like this, and sort of want to use it as a possible option for an NPC encounter in my upcoming campaign. In my scenario, the party finds an archmage who used their magic to create a sauna, and is enjoying lounging around. They aren't too pleased to entertain visitors, and as an Neutral Evil Evoker, a certain fondness for watching people crumble to ash is present. Still, the party catches our master-evoker on a ""good day"", and they are given a chance to earn their safety. Play a song, do some tricks, whatever, just entertain their ""host"" (three successful DC 25 (expected level 13+) skill checks before three failed checks), and be allowed to leave, without getting incinerated.

The catch here is I assume that *just* getting their safety is sort of jerkish of me, so I think if they did well, said wizard should maybe actually REWARD them for their efforts. Here's where we come to my problem; I can't hink of anything. ;) 

If you were a powerful wizard fond of blowing things up, but your guests actually entertained you, what might you give them to praise their success, apart from their skins?

0,0,7,7,"I've just created a level 1 artificer for a new game, and I've noticed that they're really, *really* dependent on their tools to use their class features. Specifically:

* Magical Tinkering: Requires thieves' tools or artisan tools.
* Spellcasting: Requires a focus. In particular, ""You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some  kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature."" This is stronger than the language requiring other spellcasters to have a focus if they want to avoid needing other material components: an artificer *needs* a focus for *all* spells, even ones that don't have a material component, and including cantrips. Also, ""After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.""
* Infuse Item: No tools required, but you need a target: ""Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.""
* Tool Expertise: Useless without tools.
* Arcane Armament: Requires a magic weapon.
* The Right Cantrip for the Job: Useless if you can't cast cantrips because you have no tools.
* Spell-Storing Item: Requires either a weapon or a spellcasting focus.
* Soul of Artifice: Relies on magic items.
* Alchemist:
   * Alchemical Homunculus: Requires alchemist's supplies to summon or revive.
   * Alchemical Mastery: Requires alchemist's supplies.
   * Chemical Savant: Resistance always works. *Greater restoration* requires alchemist's supplies.
* Artillerist: Note that you can now use rods, staffs and wands as spellcasting focuses.
   * Arcane Turret: Requires smith's tools.
   * Wand Prototype: Requires woodcarver's tools to imbue a wand.
   * Fortified Position: Enhances Arcane Turret.

Now, I actually think that this is a good thing. If any class is going to be in trouble without their equipment, it's the artificer. I think it's interesting that they're even worse off than a wizard if they get thrown in a dungeon without their stuff.

Anyway, this has some interesting tactical implications. Firstly, it removes one of my usual reasons for taking an attack cantrip, that being ""I want to be able to fight even if I lose all my stuff"". Very few attack cantrips have material components, the exceptions being Infestation, Thorn Whip and Word of Radiance. But as an artificer, I can't cast anything at all without my tools, and if I still have my tools, I probably still have my crossbow, so attack cantrips lose some of their utility there.

Secondly, it behooves an artificer to have some kind of recovery strategy for if they lose their gear. One approach is to make sure you choose an infusion that works on a common item, since infusions don't require tools, and an infused item can be used as a spellcasting focus. The obvious way is to choose Enhanced Weapon, which many artificers will do regardless. Then, if you lose everything, you can bootstrap your way back to spellcasting by finding or making a weapon - even if that means turning a tree branch into a club - and then taking a long rest, then imbuing the weapon and using it as a focus to prepare and cast your spells. That won't let you use Magical Tinkering or any of your specialty abilities, though.

Another approach is to be proficient with a tool kit that is easily obtainable. I recommend Cook's Utensils - you can find cooking supplies in the kitchen of the nastiest orc fortress or kobold warren, and they cost one whole gold piece in the marketplace. It won't be enough for your specialty abilities, but you'll get your spellcasting back immediately.

In theory, at high levels, you could get hold of a focus (cheap tools or an imbued weapon) and then use Fabricate to create whatever tools you want, as long as you have the right proficiency to make the tools. That's probably a better bet for the Artillerist, since smith's tools would be the proficiency to make most tool kits, including more smith's tools. I can't think of any other way to obtain tools magically *ex nihilo* \- Leomund's Secret Chest requires you to have the replica chest on hand. Maybe your GM will let you use the Many-Handed Pouch infusion to add a new pouch (looted from your goblin jailer) to an existing pouch network, in which you've stored the LSC replica chest, allowing you to summon your chest which contains backup tools and other emergency supplies, but I don't think that's quite RAW.

Anyway, I just think the tool aspect of the artificer is interesting, and makes for an entertaining and intriguing new approach to spellcasting and other class features. Any thoughts?",dndnext_test,What is an Artificier without his tools?

For one of my most recent characters, Joe Greenglow (Enchantment Wizard) hates the Invisibility spell. This isn't because he faced invisible enemies, but because of an event in his past.

After a particular deal goes wrong (he is a charlatan), his master (uncle training him wizardry) casts the spell Invisibility on Joe, and tells him to head home. Once he made it to the front door, he spent a frustrating half hour trying to find the key he left in his pocket (it was caught on something), then another 5 minutes trying to open the door with said key.

He mostly just finds the spell inconvenient, and would just rather turn his clothing inside out and cast Alter Self. Later on, if he comes across the Invisibility spell, he would probably still record it, and maybe even prepare it, just in case. That still doesn't mean he likes it.",dndnext_test,What kind of spells do your PCs hate?

0,0,4,8,"First of all, we would like to apologise for the chaos brought about by our April Fool's alternative flairs. It was fun while it lasted, but we understand that we should really get back into the swing of things. 

I'm sure that you've heard the mods mention some changes are afoot with regards to the sub. Implementation of these changes are off to a slow start at the moment and we can only again apologise that we are not working as quickly as we intended. 

That being said, I am pleased to inform everyone that one of our planned changes is coming into effect as of this moment.

Our mischief in tampering with the flairs list during April Fool's Day was the starting point for the mods to actually update our official flairs. The list is now a little more streamlined and we hope this simplifies things a little bit for you all.

With the updating of the flairs list of course comes the updating of the flairs explanation post. That's what this post essentially is. You will find a quick breakdown of the flairs below which we hope would be helpful to you in utilising this sub.

As before, we require everyone to please flair their posts appropriately. 

This post will be temporarily stickied for visibility and eventually moved to the sidebar when we get to updating that as well! Apologies for any inconvenience and we really appreciate everyone's patience thus far.

**How to flair a post:**

It's really easy. Once your post is submitted, right above the comments there should be a line of commands for your post. One of these is Flair. Click that and it will open up a list of flairs for you to select. Click on the most appropriate one and then select ""save.""

On mobile, you should have the option to flair posts as well. Some reddit apps are different than others, but usually in the upper right-hand corner there will be a menu from which you can edit your post flair.

**What our flairs mean:**

* **As a Player (1e or 2e)**: Anything regarding being a player for a specific edition. Character talk, build advice and all other topics relating to the Pathfinder experience **as a player on the table** falls under this category

* **As a GM (1e or 2e)**: Anything regarding running a game from behind the GM screen for a specific edition. Discussing subsystems, rules interactions, encounter building, and all other topics relating to the Pathfinder experience **as the GM of the table** falls under this category.

* **Resources (1e or 2e)**: Submission or discussion of character sheets, tools, generators, and 
general utilities that make gaming easier. Apps and guides that directly assist in enhancing the Pathfinder experience fall under this category.

* **Shameless self-promo**: Use this to promote your Pathfinder-specific activities, products, and original contributions. Please note that our subreddit rules for self-promotion applies. Podcasts, original art commissions, funding requests, and all other posts with the intent to monetize or provide exposure to your specific Pathfinder experience and Pathfinder-related skills fall under this category.

As a first time group of Pathfinder players, we're still getting used to the flow of combat calculations, so to help the barbarian player I developed this sliding summary sheet. Whats different about it is that all of the small boxes are cut out, and a second sheet is placed behind it, so as he shifts from normal mode into Rage (and then to Fatigued or even Exhausted), his numbers shift automatically, so he doesn't need to flip through 2-3 sheets to calculate his ARs and Damage on the fly. I know it will need adjustments to make it scalable (so I don't have to redo it each time he levels), and its completely out the window if he takes ability damage, but its a start!

####Ecology  

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is hatched with conventional horse colors and markings.

The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the company of a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one—before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle’s straps interfere with the creature’s wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Ride check each round merely to control his mount.

Pegasi lay eggs—they are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies.

Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.

A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds.

In some pegasi, the blood of a mighty heroic stallion ancestor runs strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, the advanced template, perfect flight maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no training to fly with a rider, but only allow themselves to be ridden by great heroes.

I'm reasonably sure that all of us are up to the challenge, but I want to get my 25% done with in the flashiest and most spectacular way possible!

I'm also tempted to go against the mold and use Shapechange to turn into a Gorgon and petrify everything, although I probably won't get a chance to go this ham for a long time afterwards.

I've been a GM for a close group of friends for about a year.

0,0,8,4,"One of my players is wanting to play as a skeleton this campaign. They have specified that they would not be an evil undead since the rest of the players have expressed that they want to be primarily good characters this campaign. While I have no problem with this we have struggled to write their backstory into the world due to the lack of non-evil undead in the pathfinder lore.

I’ve heard before that there may be some good liches in the pathfinders lore but I haven’t really been able to find anything on them. Besides this I’m trying to think of a situation in which a creature would be raised from the dead with free will and just left to do whatever it wants.

The player suggested perhaps they were raised by a necromancer but were unable to get out of their grave for a considerable amount of time and were left behind. Though I very much like this idea and don’t want to step on my players character I was under the impression that undead raised by necromancers were mindless and bound to the necromancers will. Though the bound part could be worked in sort of like an evil patron and add some interesting character development the mindless angle is slightly more problematic for a pc.

0,0,8,2,"So the other day my players were fighting a Nightwing after using up a lot of their resources adventuring. After the party took some serious damage the witch decided to try a Baleful Polymorph, and through some lucky rolls managed to turn it into a frog, however it retained it's mental ability scores. (It turns out transforming a huge undead into a tiny animal is fairly complex, like does it now have a constitution score? I decided against that). This transformation removed a lot of the creatures abilities but as a final middle finger it used a finger of death to kill the witch in revenge before it was finished off by the rest of the team taking turns to whack it over the head and fill it with arrows.

After the fight the team realised to get the witch back on her feet they needed to get into town, however none of them have access to any teleportation magic and they were currently stuck in a Demiplane. They had some scrolls of plane shift, however the only person with any ranks in user magic device was... the witch. This is where the witches familiar comes in, the witches player remembered that familiars get every skill rank that their master gets and familiars actually get pretty smart as they level up (also it put on the witches headband), so I said why not and the party had a scorpion plane shift them back to (120miles off the coast of (but that's ok because the druid wild shaped into a whale)) the big city.

This seems really punishing since their spell can now be interrupted. Since damage increases a lot faster than your concentration check it seems like a caster being hit will definitely lose their spell at higher levels. Now any competent sorcerer (or what have you) should have defenses up so they aren't easy to hit, but by the same token any competent archer should still be able to peg them at least once with their full round action.

0,0,4,2,"I'm working on a region for my campaign that's filled with inanimate dangers (largely mirroring the zone from S.T.A.L.K.E.R.), the most prevalent of which I was hoping would be radiation. I was targeting a system that would make radiation less lethal for low level players that bumble into it, but still devastating should one decide to linger, I also wanted a system that allows me to give items that aid radiation sickness as well as magic items with drawbacks that induce radiation sickness. I'm looking for feedback, so here's what I have:

Radiation: The degree of how much radiation a creature has absorbed is represented by the number of Radiation Points a creature has. Radiation Points gained from environmental radiation are gained depending on the degree of severity of radiation in the area, which is detailed below. The number of Radiation Points a creature can gain before increasing is equal to the creature's Base Constitution Score (this is equal to their Constitution Score without any damage or drain accounted for). While affected by radiation, the creature must succeed a Fortitude Saving Throw equal to the DC listed in the table at each frequency interval to negate the listed effects. Once the creature is no longer being irradiated, Radiation Points can be removed naturally at a rate of 1 per hour with a successful saving throw, for every 5 by which the save exceeds the DC, an additional Radiation Point is removed. The minimum Radiation Points a creature can have is zero, the maximum is equal to five times the creature's Base Constitution Score, every Radiation Point gained beyond that number is taken instead as Constitution Damage without a save.

Rad. Level | Rad. per Rnd | Rad. Pts. Range | Fort DC | Dam. per Rnd | Dam. per Hr. | Drain per Day
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Inert | 0 | 1 to BCS | 10 | -- | -- | 1 CON
Low | 1 | BCS+1 to 2xBCS | 13 | 1 CON | 1 STR | 1d4 CON
Moderate | 2 | 2xBCS+1 to 3xBCS | 17 | 1d4 CON | 1d4 STR | 2d4 CON
High | 3 | 3xBCS+1 to 4xBCS | 22 | 2d4 CON | 1d6 STR | 4d6 CON
Severe | 4 | 4xBCS+1 to 5xBCS | 30 | 4d6 CON | 2d6 STR | 6d8 CON

I loosely framed it off the existing Radiation table, but added the Inert category, where a creature is slowly succumbing to CON Drain, but with plenty of hours to overcome the Radiation Points through natural saves, this will hopefully be where most people ""bumble into"" and survive to talk about it.

Below are a couple of mundane items I've drafted up to help combat environmental radiation. I'm planning on introducing items that are similar to Ioun Stones, but irradiate the user slowly (closer to a rate of 1 per minute).

&gt;Podtat Extract: *Drinking this liter of clear fluid forces the imbiber's body to metabolize radiation faster.*

&gt;The imbiber removes 1 Radiation Point by drinking the entire contents of the bottle (an action requiring 1 round to complete), becomes sickened for 1 hour, and makes a DC 5 Fortitude save to avoid falling unconscious for 1d4 hours and nauseated for 1 day. The DC of additional uses of Podtat Extract are increased by 3 for 1 day (this increase stacks). If the imbiber cannot be sickened or nauseated, they gain no benefit from Podtat Extract.

This is intended as cheap solution to irradiation that won't do well halfway through a fight.

&gt;AntiRadioactive: *This syringe is filled with a dubious mix of chemicals made to stabilize radioactive elements in the recipient's body.*

&gt;Administering this requires a Trained DC 10 Heal check as a full-round action, failing this check does not prevent additional checks, but wastes the dosage of AntiRadioactive. The recipient receives an additional save to remove Radiation Points with a +2 bonus. If successful, they remove an additional 2d6 Radiation Points, if unsuccessful they still remove 1 Radiation Point. A single creature can only receive this treatment every 10 minutes. Special: a character with 5 ranks in Heal may increase the DC by 10 to reduce the time between dosages on the target creature to 1 minute.

This is intended as a quick shot for emergencies. Much more expensive than Podtat Extract, but also much more effective.

&gt;Leadweave Suit: *This light armor is interwoven with lead fibers, which prove heavy but offer some protection in hazardous environments.*

&gt;Light Armor, +1 AC, +6 Max DEX, -2 ACP, 10% Spell Failure, 25 lbs

&gt;The lead fibers in this full-body suit allow the wearer to resist environmental radiation. Each suit is made with a rating corresponding to a level of environmental radiation (Low, Moderate, High, or Severe). Against this level or lower, the suit reduces the rate of Radiation Point gain from per Round to per Minute. The suit has no effect against higher radiation levels than its rating and non-environmental radiation sources. The suit can also only absorb a limited amount of radiation before its usefulness is spent. Any given suit can only function for one hour under any amount of environmental radiation (calculated in increments of one minute).

This should offer players protection against radiation, at a potentially hefty cost for more advanced suits. I'm altering how a handful of spells interact with radiation to remove some of the ""instant solutions"" and such. Additionally, I'm adding the following alternative for any Cure spell:

&gt;Any Cure spell can be cast to remove Radiation Points. When cast in this way, no hit points are regained, but instead the target removes a number of Radiation Points equal to twice the spell's level.

0,0,22,51,"I've been looking into the various ways of moving through soil and rock for my wizard. Among other things, I saw the spell Earth Glide and really liked it. Much later in my research, I also noticed the spell Burrow, which also looks good. I've been keeping these in mind and weighing them against other options (such as the Oread feat chain Stony Step -&gt; Oread Burrower -&gt; Oread Earth Glider). 

However, once I started comparing the two spells, I started getting very confused. This is what I've read on them so far, and I was hoping someone could maybe explain if I'm missing something in my reasoning. 

Burrow is a **3rd** level spell and gives you a 15 foot burrow speed through loose soil, dirt, sand, and similar (reduced to 10 feet if you're wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying beyond a light load). It also gives you 5 feet burrowing speed through stone, and it lasts 1 **minute**/level. 

Earth Glide is a **4th** level spell that gives you just a flat 5 foot movement speed through dirt, rock, sand, etc.  It also only lasts 1 **round**/level. The only added bonus this spell has that is apparent to me is that it lets you move through lava if you have a way to deal with fire damage. 

Both spells have the clauses about not granting the ability to breathe underground, the user not being able to charge or run, and the user being able to still cast spells and attack. As far as drawbacks, Earth Glide mentions being susceptible to the Move Earth spell and Burrow does not (though I personally think it would apply in both cases anyway). 

The only other difference I can see is that Burrow specifies that loose material collapses behind you after 1 round, whereas Earth Glide makes no such mention, simply stating that there is no apparent tunnel or hole. Given that there isn't too much information about burrow mechanics for Pathfinder, I don't know how to approach that one. 

Bearing all that in mind, is there literally **any** practical reason, sans going through lava, that one would want Earth Glide over Burrow, as far as the spell versions? As far as I can tell, Burrow gives you the same movement speed through stone, better movement speed through everything softer, and lasts for 1 minute/level instead of 1 round/level, **and** it's a lower level spell. Is this just a flaw of the spells' designs, or am I seriously missing something?

A friend more knowledgeable on tabletops than I suggested that it might be that Earth Glide lets you go through worked stone while Burrow does not, but neither spell makes any mention of this, and there are other spells (Soften Earth and Stone, Transmute Rock to Mud) that explicitly refer to worked stone if it's relevant. Plus I can't find anything in the (admittedly sparse) burrowing rules about it either.

I am currently building the encounter for the final boss of a one shot I'm doing. Unless the players run in and straight attack there is an opportunity to talk with the boss, an adult blue dragon.

The dragon is mostly just playing villainous conversation with the PCs while slowly moving around as he talks (kind of like Smaug when he was talking to Bilbo in The Hobbit). Really he's just biding time and lining himself up to get a breath attack in that can hit all of the PCs.

I'm thinking of doing either a perception or sense motive check to discern the dragons true intention to abruptly fire a breath attack mid conversation.

On the chance that the PCs don't realize this, for whatever reason, does the dragon firing his breath weapon mid conversation qualify a surprise round? Logically I feel it does since the PCs don't realize he is about to attack suddenly but I'm not so sure RAW.

If not, I'm guessing I just roll initiative normally whenever the dragon decides to make his attack and not worry about doing sense motive or perception check to discern.

Edit: for clarity I would like to say that I'm not trying to upstage the PCs or anything with this move, honestly I'm wanting them to see it coming and have them react. I was just unsure how a situation like this would play out mechanically since most of the time it's ""oh shit a dragon, I attack it.""

Given the replies, it does make more sense to not have the surprise round and instead give a bonus to initiative for the dragon. If the PCs sense motive before the attack and figure out he's trying to line up a shot I'll give them the initiative bonus instead if they declare an attack.

Edit 2: hot damn I did not expect this to gain as much traction as it did. Entire subthreads about what classifies surprise and alternative ways for the dragon to talk while positioning and a debate on if Han shot first. Gotta say, the comments are extremely helpful and majority of you do agree that it's not best to do a surprise round which is perfectly fine for me. I don't want the encounter to be unfair rather I want it to be thematic of a tense standoff where the PCs can either quickly rush the dragon down or hear him out only for him to try to position and attack, I just wasn't sure the best way to go about it, thus this post. All in all, I'm really happy with the quick and steady stream of replies giving new information and better ways to work this encounter. Everything you guys have said has been helpful.

0,0,29,2,"TL;DR: Your martial homebrew or houserule buff can't be game breaking, because the spellcasters did that already.

So I've been playing Pathfinder on and off for about two years, but I didn't start getting serious about it (researching builds and whatnot) until this past November. It seems there is a dissonance between how to balance martial classes against magic users, especially during the lower levels, and it ends shutting down any attempts to fix what makes many martials so underpowered in the first place. Sure, there are alternate rules that give martials more comabt utility, like the Spheres of Power, but what if you just want to make a few minor tweaks instead of learning an entirely new system? I'd like to suggest a clause as an attempt to smooth out as much of these disagreements as possible:

""As long as a martial class build does not completely render spellcasting obsolete, or does not possess a feature that the majority of spell casters cannot replicate, it is not broken.""

What this means is that any suggested buffs or revisions to a martial class should be fine, as long as they still allow spellcasters to participate meaningfully in combat. For example, an optimized UC Rogue can deal massive amounts of damage to a single target, with the option of sacrificing damage for combat maneuver debuffs, but your standard wizard can perform party buffs, enemy debuffs, create terrain, summon creatures, deal unqiue types of damage, and temporarily stop combat altogether; an optimized wizard can perform several of these actions via proxies like familiars and constructs. So in spite of the UC Rogue's infamous sneak attack, it still pales in comparison to what the poster child of spellcasters can do. 

That's not to say that the UC Rogue is in need of another upgrade, but let's look at one of the most controversial of the revised classes: the chained monk. Heavily dependent on at least 3 ability scores, it has a revision history marred by an uncertainty of what it's purpose is supposed to be in such a class oriented game, and a inelegant inclusion of an Asian archetype in a European fantasy world. Paizo gave the UC monk a LOT of buffs, but also tried to balance some of these buffs with some questionable design choices, like nerfing the UC monk's base Will save. Let's say someone's homebrewed UC monk kept the chained monk's Will progression. Is increasing its base Will save at level 1 from +0 to +2 gamebreaking? Sure, it gives them the best baseline saves in the game, but it hardly makes them broken; there are over 10 spellcaster classes that can get Resistance as a level 0 spell, and there are plenty of level 1 spells that combat saving conditions. Even when taking into account the UC monk's Flurry of Blows and wide selection of ki powers &amp; style strikes, there is very little that a UC monk can do in combat that a savy and well-equipped martial class can do about as well, let alone complete surpass the spellcasters.

This clause also prevents buffs to martials from entering the same game-breaking tiers as the spellcasters; there's only so much that swinging a sword or shooting a bow should do, after all. For example, let's say someone's homebrewed barbarian had a rage power that refreshed their action economy, effectively giving them two turns worth of actions in one. As powerful as the spellcasters are, they have very little in their collective arsenal that can come close to duplicating this kind of power (namely Time Stop), and even then there are heavy conditions. Thus, this clause strikes down this rage power as broken, with the explanation being that no spellcaster can perform a similar feat.

I'll admit, a lot of my motivation to write this does stem from my frustration with how the monk has been designed, but I didn't write this to rag against spellcasters. I just think there are martial classes that are in need of some new features that could stand to be a little out of the box, and maybe even flat-out powerful mechanically speaking (*cough cough* ranger). I'd love to hear any of your suggestions for how to improve the martial classes, either individually or as a group.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something relatively unusual—an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own.

Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni mask—this does not require a Craft check or any additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here.

While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them.

When a spirit oni’s master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choices—but the spirit oni’s innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more befitting their egos and desires.

So my players did the whole Chasing the Skinsaw part a little differently than I think the modules planned for. They went to Magnimar, immediately busted into the Townhouse and found the paper discussing the Seven's Sawmill every Oathday. They all have some sort of disguise magic, so they waited until Oathday to infiltrate the Sawmill. There, they witnessed Justice Ironbriar sacrifice a gambler. Not risking their lives with 12 cultists and Ironbriar, the players decided to follow the two cultists that were disposing of the body. They ambushed them and took them captive, effectively making them their inside men.

0,0,22,116,"**Preface to the Preface**

I recently took a 200hr Yoga Teacher Training Course. Our final project could be anything. People in the past have done essays, interpretive dances, murals, sculptures... so yeah, anything. I decided I would create a character based on some of the philosophy of a yoga practice. Specifically, the *Yoga Sutras* by Patanjali, with a little bit of extra material from other important figures in yoga history, as well as the teachers of the studio from which I got my certification. I don't know how much overlap there is in the venn diagram of yoga practitioners and Pathfinder players, but I figured some of you might enjoy it. My first ever tabletop campaign (a Pathfinder one) is coming to an end this Friday, so we're rolling new characters soon and this manifesto (of sorts) is what I'll use as a character bible when I make my character sheet and while I'm roleplaying him. I welcome any feedback or suggestions, as 40 sessions does not make me a Pathfinder expert by any means. Also, forgive me for having to explain what Ability Scores, Alignment, etc are-- this is written for those who are familiar with neither yoga nor Tabletop RPGs. Without further introduction, allow me to introduce you to **Vrittag Longspine**.

**Preface**

In approaching this exercise, some concessions must be made. Like all aspects of yoga, there is much left up to interpretation. If one were to take everything as dogma, there could be no effective character in a Pathfinder game. *Ahimsa* is the concept non-violence toward others, and as the very first *Yama*, one might argue that there’s point in continuing. However, there’s simply no fun in that. As a wise man once said, “It depends.” For example, non-violence is only one understanding of *ahimsa*. Another is that it refers to striving towards the least amount of harm. In that sense, some violence is condoned, as long as it is intended to reduce the overall amount of violence.

Is this a matter of mental gymnastics or an exploration into subjectivity? It depends.

**Overall Vision**

Before getting into the nitty gritty of abilities, powers, and race, a basic goal should be determined. As the title suggests, this is an effort to create a Pathfinder character that generally adheres to the philosophy presented in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. While that provides a wealth of options in terms of resource allocation and general characterization, an effort will be made to balance what most honors the Sutras with what most honors the Pathfinder rules and creating an effective character, not just a character. Of course, that necessitates more subjectivity, and that’s where I come in.

Characters in tabletop roleplaying games are not created or played in a vacuum, even when using such an inspiration as the Yoga Sutras. I will do my best to translate the sutras to the character in an honest fashion, but if I thumb the scale every now and then, that’s what makes this character my character, and not just a dry interpretation of source material. The best role-playing characters have humanity and life in them, and that shouldn’t be sacrificed for the sake of objectivity.

As such, my vision for this character is someone who doesn’t want to fight, but must. The character will be male, because while it’s already a challenge enough to translate a host of *Yamas*, *Niyamas*, and *Kleshas* into character traits, I am a male, and respectfully navigating gender politics is not something that will make this easier. He will be succinct with his words, but not gruff, and he will not lie often or well. He will be aloof-- very much in harmony with himself, but lacking many of the social skills needed to have particularly meaningful relationships with others. 

**Class**

This designation describes the archetype that one might generally find in a fantasy setting-- Wizard, Barbarian, Bard, etc.-- and is arguably the most important decision in building a character. The classes each specialize in certain things and have different physical and magical abilities. The one that appears most appropriate for this character is Monk. The first description of this in the Core Rulebook is “For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield-- it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind.” Similarly, yoga may be an approach to fitness for some people, but it is much more than that for some practitioners. It can be the action towards selfless service, the offering of love to the collective world and the divine, and the striving of wisdom towards absolute truth. 

**Ability Scores**

There are six basic attributes that correspond to every character’s raw talent and prowess, and they also branch out to affect individual Skills, such as Diplomacy (Charisma) and Acrobatics (Dexterity). They are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. An argument could be made to prioritize any one of these, but I think the most important one here is Wisdom. While Intelligence is defined by the game as logic and reason, Wisdom governs willpower, awareness, and intuition. Certain classes ‘rely’ on certain abilities more than others-- Fighters need Strength, Bards need Charisma, etc.-- and, fittingly, Monks value Wisdom the most. In the practice of yoga, Wisdom is tied to a litany of ideas from *santosha* (contentment with what one has) to *tapaha* (self-discipline amidst obstacles), but Wisdom also grants a practitioner the ways in which yoga can be more than just a way to sweat and get bendy.

In the hierarchy of how to value these abilities for this character, Strength comes next. Hand to hand fighting is the primary method in which a Monk deals damage, and Strength is tied to that the most. For a yogi, especially one in a vinyasa class, Strength is crucial. Putting one’s body in a series of physically demanding poses requires the muscle to not only develop good form, but the energy leftover to ensure that one’s physical posture is not the only focus.

Constitution measures one’s health and stamina. So many yogic ideas can be associated with this when interpreted as either mental health or taking care of one’s body. *Ahimsa*, for example, means least overall harm, so harm to one’s self certainly falls under that category. Monks, who fight at close range, are on the front lines and thus in the most danger, so durability is obviously important. Additionally, a character’s ability to breath (be it holding breath underwater or suffocating in a room without oxygen) is directly tied to Constitution, which makes its relevance to yoga (via *pranayama*, the control of one’s breath) even more pronounced. 

Notice here how the three most important abilities directly correspond to the three purposes of a yoga practice, as developed by the “father of modern yoga”, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. *Cikitsa* is treatment and therapy. Consider that Constitution is tied to health and well-being, and that it determines how effective your healing attempts are. *Siksha* is fitness, and thus clearly Strength. *Upasana* is personal transformation and spirituality. We’ve gone over how Wisdom relates to several heady concepts that can fall under the umbrella of philosophy and spirituality, but in Pathfinder, Wisdom also translates to a Monk’s ki pool, which is a resource that grants him supernatural energy and the literal ability for personal transformation

The next abilities aren’t unimportant, they simply aren’t valued quite as much as the ones I’ve already covered. Dexterity is agility and speed, neither of which are a big part of yoga practice. A frequent adage in yoga is that, “speed masks weakness”. Flowing through a sequence of poses in a quick manner allows one’s body to conceal the fact that they might not be able to fully express some or all of those poses over an extended timeframe. Intelligence (logic and reason) can sometimes lead to rigid ways of thinking about things, and in realms where philosophy, magic, and flexibility (both bodily and mental), such constrictions can be less than ideal. Charisma, which is the stat that determines personality and personal magnetism. Again, yoga doesn’t eschew Charisma by any means, but the idea of a yoga practitioner who is aloof or stoic (as opposed to a social butterfly) is not exactly a brand new stereotype.

**Race**

The Rulebook states, “... the races of [Pathfinder] are a diverse mix of cultures, sizes, attitudes, and appearances.” From a perspective of game mechanics, this means that different races are granted inherent traits and bonuses/penalties. Half-orcs are prone to losing their temper in bouts of rage, and Humans are particularly multi-talented and can specialize in any number of things. Dwarves are known for being wise, tough, and stoic, which translates to a bonus in Wisdom and Constitution, and a penalty in Charisma, all of which is right in line with our yogi.

**Skills**

While Abilities are basic attributes, Skills refer to specific actions your character can take in and out of combat. They include things like Intimidate, Disguise, and Swim. A player can allocate resources to make these actions more successful. The two that stand out to me are Acrobatics and Perception. Acrobatics refers to the physical grace and balance with which one controls one’s body, which, in terms of yoga, are crucial. (There is also a game mechanic called “Wisdom in the Flesh” where I can use my Wisdom score to improve a Skill, which would be Acrobatics, which might be the most synergistic idea in this entire outline.) Perception allows one to notice fine details through the five senses. Three things commonly worked on in a yoga class are proprioception (sense of where you are in space), interoception (sense of where you are internally, meaning digestion, breath, etc.), and neuroception (sense of what is safe/dangerous/life-threatening). Beyond a etymological connection, these ideas are very closely linked and thus should be prioritized. Other skills that seem appropriate are Stealth (very rarely in yoga do we make noise unintentionally) and Knowledge of Religion, which I’d define as knowledge of spirituality.

**Alignment**

One of the last major decisions regards a character’s position on the two spectrums of morality and rules. Morality is the sliding scale of Good vs. Evil. Good people protect innocent life, whereas Evil people kill indiscriminately, whether for money or fun. Clearly, our character, a follower of *ahimsa*, would fall under Good. The other spectrum is that of Lawful vs. Chaotic. Lawful people honor traditions and respect authority, whereas Chaotic people are nebulous and generally spurn tradition and authority. Someone abiding by principles and ideas that have been around for thousands of years would, without question, be considered Lawful. 

**Character Bio**

Born into a family of warriors, Vrittag grew up learning how to fight. His years of training developed his martial prowess, but he eventually became disillusioned with violence and decided to live his life as a peaceful monk. This decision caused a schism with his family and he moved away to make his life easier. He eventually found a home with a frontier community where he farms produce. He keeps his mind sharp and his body fit by meditating frequently and is more comfortable with animals and nature than with other people.

0,0,26,23,"Hi all,

I'm really hoping I get a definitive answer to this one; I've been driving myself mad trying to find a hard line in any of the rules to confirm or deny the following;

Our DM is under the impression that you can't make melee touch attacks without provoking an attack of opportunity, **unless** you have Improved Unarmed Strike. I disagree.

I have already clarified with him that the act of delivering a touch spell ie Shocking Grasp, does not provoke as the delivering creature is considered to be proficient with melee touch attacks. It was hampering our casters a fair old bit and caused a couple of near-deaths (of which my pasty Wizard was one). But the instance from which this latest grudge arose from our Bard's fun new spell, *Sonic Form,* which states that while she's under its effects, *""You can make a melee touch attack once per round that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage + 1 point per caster level.""*

Now, from my point of view - a self-confessed rules lawyer, and not a very good one either (I get VERY excited) - I know that the Unarmed Strike rules specifically call out the need for Improved Unarmed Strike to avoid provocation.

The only information I can find regarding non-spell melee touch attacks, however, are the rules for things like a Shadow's Incorporeal Touch ability, which do not provoke attacks, have no access to Improved Unarmed Strike, aren't using a natural weapon to deliver it (there is no ""claw"" or ""bite"", just ""incorporeal touch""), and reads as essentially the same basic mechanic; Roll to hit touch AC, deliver d6 + whatever damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a concrete rule I can refer to? Our Bard loves her new spell and she doesn't like getting smacked in the face for playing according to the rules.

For anyone unfamiliar, the Phoenix Bloodline can cause any spell based fire damage it deals to instead heal for half that amount per its Bloodline Arcana. The Unicorn Bloodline on the other hand, just gets ""cure"" spells as well as some restoration and other similar spells as Bloodline Spells, as well as a Bloodline Arcana that heals a single target in sight whenever it casts one of those spells.

What I'm getting at though, is that these Bloodlines have the above dope healing potential while also having unrestricted access to the uncontested dopest spell list in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

However brawler itself says that: 

""At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) levels and [monk](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk) levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) and a [monk](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk) for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as [Stunning Fist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/stunning-fist-combat) and a [*monk’s robe*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-monk-s)).

If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-Level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like the monk’s AC bonus.""

Hey guys! I am fan of necromancers, but in pathfinder no class really makes feel like you are a master of the undead. So in this class you have some solid features that already exist from other classes with a sprinkle of features that i made myself.

Have a look and tell me what you guys think!!!


Ultimate Necromancer


Prerequisits: 
Knowledge Arcana, Religion, Spellcraft, Use Magic Device 5

Class Features
The following are class features of the lord of the dead prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ultimate Necromancers gain no new proficiencies with any armor or weapons.

Spells per Day
When a Ultimate Necromancer gains a level, he gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of Ultimate Necromancer to the level of whatever other spellcasting class he has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a Ultimate Necromancer, he must choose which class he adds each Ultimate Necromancer level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Aligned Class Feature (Ex)
At 1st level, the Ultimate Necromacer must choose a class he belonged to before adding the prestige class, then select a feature he already possessed to be his aligned class feature. He gains all the benefits of having this feature through the entirety of the prestige class. Eg. If a Magus 5/Ultimate Necomancer 1 were to pick his Spell Combat feature, as he progresses through being a Ultimate Necromancer if Spell Were to improve at all if he were to stay a magus, then it still will improve.

Inspired Necromancy (Ex)
When determining the maximum number of Hit Dice of undead he can control with spells like animate dead, a character counts his Ultimate Necromancer levels twice. This ability does not factor into how many undead he can create with a single casting of a spell. Thus, a cleric 7/Ultimate Necromancer 3 would be able to control 52 Hit Dice worth of undead with Animate Dead, lesser or Animate Dead.

Secrets of Death (Ex)
At 2rd level and 2nd level thereafer, an Ultimate Necromancer gains new insights into the dark arts of necromancy. At the time he gains this ability, the character may add a necromancy spell that is not normally a part of his class’s spell list to his spell list. For example, an Ultimate Necromancer with levels of wizard might choose to add spells like death watch, inflict critical wounds, and slay living to his spell list, while an Ultimate Necromancer with levels of cleric might choose to add spells such as enervation, magic jar, and vampiric touch. An Ultimate Necromancer may choose to add spells he cannot yet cast—this does not allow the Ultimate Necromancer to cast spells of a higher level than he normally could, but rather merely grants him access to those spells when he reaches the level required to cast them.

Necropolitan (Ex)
An Ultimate Necromancer gains a bonus equal to his Ultimate Necromancer level (minimum +1) on Diplomacy and Knowledge checks regarding undead creatures. Because of his obsessive focus on the undead, he takes a –2 penalty when attempting such checks regarding living creatures.

Undead Mastery:
All undead creatures created by a Ultimate Necromancer of at least 3rd level gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 1 additional hit point per Hit Die. In addition, the Ultimate Necromancer's limit for controlling creatures created by the Animate dead,lesser or Animate Dead spells increases by an amount equal to half of the spellcasting ability modifier possessed by the class before becoming an Ultimate Necromancer. (Eg. Charisma for Bards, Sorcerer, and Oracles Intelligence for Wizards, Arcanists, and Magi, and Wisdom for Clerics and Warpriests.) Enhancing undead in this manner can not stack with the effects of the Descecrate Spell, except of doubling the HD limit for a single casting of Animate Dead, lesser and Animate Dead.

At 5th level this bonus increases to +4 Strength and Dexterity, +2 hitpoints per hit die and the Ultimate Necromancer adds his entire spellcasting ability modifier to each caster level of her control limit instead of half.

At 7th level this bonus increases to +6 Strength and Dexterity, +3 hit points per HD and the Ultimate Necromancer adds 1.5 times her spellcasting ability modifier to the number of HD of undead per caster level that she can control. 

At 9th level this bonus increases to +8 Strength and Dexterity, +4 hit points per HD and the Ultimate Necromancer adds twice her spellcasting modifier to the number of HD of undead per caster level that she can control. 

Spawn Mastery (Su)
At 4th level, whenever a lord of the dead would create a free-willed undead, that undead is instead under the lord of the dead’s control. A lord of the dead can control up to 4 HD of undead per lord of the dead level in this manner. Excess undead are free-willed unless previously controlled undead are released.

Undead Manipulator (Ex)
At 6th level, the Ultimate Necromancer gains great insight into the minds and necromantic forces controlling undead creatures. An Ultimate Necromancer’s spells and spell-like abilities with mind-affecting effects treat undead creatures as their original type. Thus, an Ultimate Necromancer can use charm person against a humanoid zombie or confusion against a horde of skeletal champions.

Death’s Shroud (Su)
At 8th level, he learns how to cloak his true intentions, gaining the ability to use nondetection or undetectable alignment once per day. The caster level for this ability is equal to the Ultimate Necromancer’s highest caster level.

Undeath Initiate (Ex)
At 10th level, an Ultimate Necromancer has prepared his body and mind for the transition into undeath. He gains a +5 bonus on any ability check, skill check, or saving throw related to the process of transforming into an undead creature. This bonus can be used on any check related to becoming a creature like a lich (the process of which is largely left up to the GM’s discretion). Additionally, if slain by an undead creature with the create spawn ability, the agent of death retains his Intelligence (regardless of the type of undead he is transformed into) and free will (he is never under the control of the creature that killed him). Unless otherwise noted by the undead creature’s create spawn ability, the newly created undead Ultimate Necromancer loses all of his class levels. This makes transformation into a lich and vampire among the most appealing options for an Ultimate Necromancer seeking undeath.

I'm interested in trying to form a group for 2E in August and have people interested.

Obviously sometimes someone may miss because they're out of town or whatever, but I just want it to be known it's a static time period or it won't be worth it for me to prep for it.

For pluses to Craft Alchemy,

This brings things to a +25 to Craft Alchemy. Add in 5 ranks, int mod +4, and +3 for class skill, we're rocking a cool +37 to Craft Alchemy.

For how much one can craft in a day, the base amount is \[DC\]\*\[Roll Result\]/\[7 days a week\] in silver.

But! Swift Alchemy kicks that up a notch to 402.9 sp per day \[not rounding until the final result\] from doubling crafting speed

And! The Valet tumor familiar's cooperative crafting doubles that up to 805.7 sp per day

Then! Master Alchemist turns that progress from SP to GP, giving you 805.7 gp per day

Finally! Since Hydroflouric Acid is a poison, Master Alchemist will give you 4 \[Int Mod\] doses when you finish making one dose \[though you must pay the full cost of the four doses\]

Since the crafting cost is 833.34 gp \[1/3\*2500\] for Hydroflouric Acid, in two full crafting days you would make 4 doses of Hydroflouric Acid for 3333.36 gp

####Appearance  

This humanoid is covered in shaggy fur and carries a heavy axe in one of his clawed hands.

####CR   4
#####Alignment:  LG
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Change Shape (Su) All lycanthropes have three forms—a humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and animal form. A natural lycanthrope can shift to any of its three alternate forms as a move-equivalent action. An afflicted lycanthrope can assume animal or hybrid form as a full-round action by making a DC 15 Constitution check, or humanoid form as a full-round action by making a DC 20 Constitution check. On nights when the full moon is visible, an afflicted lycanthrope gains a +5 morale bonus to Constitution checks made to assume animal or hybrid form, but a –5 penalty to Constitution checks made to assume humanoid form. An afflicted lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise, or after 8 hours of rest, whichever comes first. A slain lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. 

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A natural lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope, this ability has no effect.

Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) In any form, natural lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with animals related to their animal form. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. Afflicted lycanthropes only gain this ability in animal or hybrid form. 


#####  
*****
####Ecology  

A creature that catches lycanthropy becomes an afflicted lycanthrope, but shows no symptoms (and does not gain any of the template's adjustments or abilities) until the night of the next full moon, when the victim involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity. The character remains in animal form until the next dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he makes a DC 20 Will save, in which case he becomes aware of his condition. 

A remove disease or heal spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting lycanthrope's attack. Alternatively, consuming a dose of wolfsbane (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560) gives an afflicted lycanthrope a new Fortitude save to recover from lycanthropy.

0,0,2,1,"So I'm planning on creating a goblin cavalier, and obviously there's some issues with them compared to say a human.  Their low str compared to other larger races makes them less than ideal for doing heavy damage to enemies with a lance.  And though I could go with one of the ranged variations, I specifically want to focus on something that does melee damage.

&amp;#x200B;

So my thoughts were either:

1: Forgo the whole lance approach, given the huge +4 bonus to dex you get as a goblin, go with lighter weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

2:It looks to be possible to get lances to use dex for all their stats, but it does require an enchantment and some heavy feat investment.

[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spear-dancing-spiral-combat/](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spear-dancing-spiral-combat/)

&amp;#x200B;

Will get you lances with weapon finesse.  Spear dancing style (one of the pre-reqs) lets you choose your polearm (lance in this case) and gives it an off-hand attack of a light mace.

&amp;#x200B;

With the polearm chosen as the spear dancing style you get the weapon finesse feat for it as well as part of Spear dancing spiral, letting you use Dex instead of STR for your attack rolls.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, with  [http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/agile/](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/agile/) 

on a lance, you can use your Dex for the damage as well.  Although it normally doesn't apply to two-handed weapons.  The lance specifically states that while mounted you can wield it in one hand.

[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance/](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance/)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall a heavy feat investment (5 feats), but I would buff up my lance quite a bit in the process and could use it with an off-hand attack while dismounted making it effectively the only weapon you'd need to carry.

&amp;#x200B;

I could take two-weapon fighting first (which would be useful generally)

Then dip one level into fighter for the extra combat feat at level 2, letting me take weapon finesse on whatever one-handed weapon I'm planning on using

Level 3 one more fighter level for the extra feat, plus the feat I get for being level 3, letting me take weapon focus for the lance and spear dancing style for the last of the pre-req's.

Level 4-5 in cavalier for, and at 5th level I get my last needed feat which I used to take spear dancing spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

By that time I should be able to get stuff enchanted and agile only costs what a +1 enchant should be, so it should be affordable.

Anyways I don't have any particular goals for this obedience (don't want to munchkin the thing). I just want it to be as flavorful as possible. So to protect against me cherry picking things that just help my character, I want to ask the community what they think this ancient Osirian deity would ask and give for the deific obedience feat?

Feel free to skip the following unless you want to know why I'm attached to such an obscure deity.

Character reasons my guy worships Osiris: he's a samsaran, so his memories of being an Osiriani cleric of osiris are surprisingly powerful this life. Moreover he kinda got screwed over on this life and just wants to move on, but he's caught in his cycle of rebirth. Since Osiris is the god of death, rebirth, and the afterlife, my character is hoping by pleasing Osiris specifically in his pursuit of harmony that he'll stop the whole rebirth thing and let him move on to the afterlife. 

Also he has the plant domain which means my theurge could qualify for the spontaneous nature's ally feat, which I just think is cool. I see my samsaran as being so jumbled up with his magical past lives that different aspects of his past affect his current abilites. I like thinking he was a druid sometime in the past and so that feat would make for great flavor. Plus the whole plant thing goes with his attitude of ""there is a season for everything"", being willing to let things die and grow for both have a purpose, etc. He'll probably be spouting a bunch of harvest related metaphors.

0,0,7,15,"#[Jiang-shi](https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Jiang-Shi)  
####Appearance  

Its flesh pallid and a parchment burial prayer hanging from its brow, this risen corpse lurches forward in a series of short hops.


####CR   6
#####Alignment:  LE
#####Size:   Medium
####Special Abilities  

Brutal Claws (Ex): A jiang-shi’s nails are brutally sharp and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19–20 and grant the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks.

Drain Chi (Su): Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains “chi,” or life energy, from a victim’s breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim’s breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. 

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Jiang-shis (often known as “hopping vampires”) are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the exhaled life energy of the living. A jiang-shi’s appearance is based on the state of the creature’s corpse at the time of its reanimation. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally, each has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches; originally intended to protect the body from restless spirits, this scroll grants a jiang-shi immunity to magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and wands.

A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not leave its corpse at the time of death, and is instead allowed to fester and putrefy within. At some point during the body’s decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque form and seeks living creatures to feed upon.

0,0,2,7,"She's playing a druid, and we're going through the 1-on-1 Adventures, put out by Expeditious Retreat Press.  She did the adventure that has the druid shrine in it, and she befriended Baggle.  They are now a druidic pair, and they are going through the area adding druid shrines.

She wanted a magical effect similar to the magical shrine in the module.  I told her she couldn't get a force field at her low level (level 6).  However, what she wanted was a small spring with clean water and what we are affectionately calling, *Goodberry Bush.*

So here is how I did it.  I told her the magic item creation rules will allow her to have the 0-level Create Water as a continuous effect for 1000 GP.  This works like the lowest setting on Decanter of Endless Water.  We have a nearby stream, so the water can runoff into that stream.

Next I told her that she could create a custom spell called *Goodberry Bush* at 3rd level.  This spell will imbue a bush with goodberry growth as per the spell (a few berries/day) but I said the magic would expire after days/level or weeks/level (I couldn't figure out a reasonable ramping up of the 1st level *Goodberry* spell).  What we end up doing was the Permanency spell, kinda.  We found a cost that matched the other spells of 1st level (2500), and said she could get a bush to work Goodberry if she was willing to pay.  We also made up a compromise where she would pay only 1000 GP and have the effect on the bush for 1 year, or multiples of 1000 for multiple years.

Finally, we also agreed that for the same price (2500 GP, as per a 1st level spell made permanent) she could get an Endure Elements effect on her shrine that would keep it nice year-round.

Together this is a bit pricey, but she's asking if it's possible to make around 20 of these shrines by level 12, and I'm thinking she'll easily afford it if she stays on wealth by level.

0,0,6,6,"Hello all,

My friends and their respective partners and I recently decided to play Pathfinder 1E together. We are running Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition, with me as the GM.

Right now, we are planning to play live sessions and we even had session 0 this previous night and the results of which have left me concerned for what will happen in live sessions in the future, mainly chatter and tangents and the like. I realize the advice will be ""be stricter, make them cut the chatter"", but I also have some concerns regarding player anxiety and dead spots in the live scenario. We're all friends here wanting to have a good time, so I would rather not foist any unnecessary complication on the matter.

Player anxiety aside, I also get anxious and lost in the information sometimes when live sessions are happening and I am not confident in my ability to work with it live as opposed to being able to type and create and tell a story that way-- a method I am much more competent in. There are also scheduling concerns.

So I want to ask: does anybody have any advice running the game as a play-by-post (PBP)? I would like for people to be able to post throughout the day.

Apply your full Str modifier to damage without multiplying, like a one-handed weapon.

* If you're also wielding a manufactured weapon, all natural attacks are secondary, so they take a -5 penalty. In a full attack, you get all of your iterative attacks with your manufactured weapon, in addition to using each natural attack. Natural attacks are always light weapons, so you take an additional -2 penalty with the TWF feat, or an additional -8 penalty without. (And -2/-4 with the manufactured weapons)

My two questions:

* What happens if you have multiple natural attacks, but only one mode? Like if I have 4 tentacles, but no other natural attacks, do I get 1.5\*Str with all of them?

For the general breakdown, its listed as a Universal Item under the Psionic Items. It states that anyone can use a universal psionic item.

**Skin of the proteus** Continually affects the wearers as the metamorphosis power. While in a form other then his natural form, the wearer does not appear to be wearing the skin. 

**Metamorphosis** 

Manifesting time 1 standard action.

Power Points 5

**Enhancement B**


Increase str, dex, or con by 4

Increase size by two categories

Decrease size by two categories

Pick 3 choices from enhancement A

Increase land speed by 20 feet.

**Abilities menu B** 

Gain 2 natural attacks

Gain +3 to your natural armor bonus

Gain 20 temp hit points

Gain Imp. Crit with natural weapons

Gain damage reduction 5/magic

Gain a fly speed of 20 ft (poor)

Gain a poison attack

Spit poison as an RTA

Gain a swim speed of 40 ft

Climb speed of 40 ft

Burrow speed of 30 ft

Gain 3 choices from abilities Menu A.

**Augment** You can augment this power in the following ways.

1. For every 4 power points you spend, you gain one choice from Enhancement menu B and once choice from abilities B, you may not choose the same option twice.

2. For every 2 power points you spend you gain one choice from Enhancement Menu A and once choice from Abilities Menu A from minor metamorphosis. You may not choose the same option twice.  



So for a player that's a non-psionic using this item, is there a pool of power points they are given for this? Is the power points listed burned every time they change their skin from different enhancements? IE they need 5 points to equip it and then spend another 4 points to get the basic powers? If they switch forms at any point does that use up another 4 points? How do they get those points back?

I’m looking for drawbacks or limiting factors. It seems like this could be used as a ""cheap"" and universal wild shape for mobility purposes. No rope? Fly or climb. Fence to tall? Burrow. Its in the water guarded by anti-aircraft mage towers? Swim around it. So whats the catch with this item?

I have (almost) no problems with mechanical part, but the lore part - for creating a background for my character - troubles me. I don't know anything about Golarion - except the part about Pathfinder Society itself, Absalom, factions and such.

1) I want to get an overview of the world, without tiny precise details (I will drown quickly), but with enough content for background hooks. In which books (sites, etc.) can I find it?

2) Speaking about my character concept, my hero will be a half-elf skald, born from beautiful elf bardess and a brave human barbarian.

He adores elven lore, ballads and epic, but he is drawn to more direct and straightforward approach to delivery, like in the bawdy songs his father sometimes sang while drunk =-)

But does this concept fit in the Golarian lore? Is there an ""elven culture"" per se? Are there places in the world with, on the one hand, predominantly elven population, and, on the other hand, where it would be not very unusual and not a social stigma for an elven women to have a human lover?

0,0,6,2,"Recently, my GM has green-lighted simulacrum as a spell that I could use and I want to use it to begin spawning an island in the center of the ocean in our very long term plan to create our own little country. As such, I am allowed to exploit the simulacrum spell-like abilities to get near-limitless spellcasting. She has stated that I am only allowed to use spells and spell-likes of level 6 and below however, so unfortunately we can't just wish an island in. I've explored certain avenues of creating our islands but I've been running into a lot of obstacles.

I've explored several avenues so far. The first of which is stone shape and move earth. Neither really work however.

* At caster level 10, move earth can shift 12000 cubic feet of stone an hour
* Move earth can shift  225000 cubic feet of stone an hour

From cursory calculations taking 2.7 miles as the average depth of an ocean (taken from the real world) we can build a chunk of land 60\*60 ft wide at water level. To build an island of any size whatsoever, this will require literally years which, due to the race of about half the party, we probably can't afford.The second avenue I tried to explore was using earth and magma elemental to burrow into the oceanic basalt and artificially create a volcanic event to forcefully form an island. This may well take years as well, but the resulting island will be far larger and rich in nutritious soil and not basically a giant pillar. The elemental doesn't need to breathe, doesn't need to sleep, and will be immune to any heat from the resulting volcanic event. The problem with this however is that the magma elemental has earth glide rather than standard tunneling which may become an issue.

The third avenue I tried to explore was that I could try to do is to buy a gate scroll and send in things to dig out the entirety of the elemental plane of earth onto the material plane. This will, of course, probably upset the denizens of the elemental plane of earth and take a fair amount of time and resources as well. It may end up being the best option if no other options presents itself however.So then here's my question to everyone.

I figured that in addition to the phantom assisting the player, at the same time the player is trying to help the phantom ""move on"" into the spirit realm.  As such, at first level, the phantom that is attached to the spiritualist is chosen at random.  Then, throughout the adventure, anytime either the phantom or the spiritualist (while housing the phantom in his consciousness) rolls a natural 20 on one of the phantom's associated skills, that skill is considered ""fulfilled"".  Once both skills have been fulfilled, the spiritualist has the option to release the phantom from his service; it can now ""move on"" to the afterlife.  The next day, when the spiritualist performs ""morning maintenance"" it gains a new phantom at random.

To me this is in line with how a phantom is kept on the material plane by their powerful emotional foci, and performing or helping someone else perform the associated skills allows them closure.  This system would also allow the player to try out different phantoms and use skills they normally wouldn't.  If they don't like the particular phantom they have, they can work towards releasing it, or keep one around if they find one they gel with.

Potential cons: The player would have a hard time forming a bond with the phantom or investing in giving them a unique personality as other companion classes like druids and summoners might do.  The constant cycling of phantoms could also keep the player from deciding on a solid direction for the character as it grows, maybe wanting to remain a jack-of-all-trades to accommodate different potential phantoms.

What do you think of this idea?  Any downsides that I haven't thought of yet?  For what it's worth, I have discussed this idea with the player and they seem fine with it.",pathfinder_test,"Idea I had to expand on Spiritualist phantoms, looking for feedback."

0,0,4,10,"So, something that's been nagging at my brain is how well the Supernatural (The TV series about two brothers fighting various creatures in order to save human lives) lore can slot in with RPGs like D&amp;D and PF. I've been drafting a few concentric campaign ideas revolving around this them, though I'm never too happy with the feel of it.

If you were tasked with creating a Supernatural using the following plot summary, how would you go about it?

&gt;The story revolves around two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester as they follow their father's footsteps, hunting down evil supernatural creatures such as monsters, demons, and even fallen gods while trying to save innocent people along the way. Continuing the ""family business"" after their father's death, the brothers soon discovered that the ""hunt"" doesn't just involve slashing and hacking monsters and demons but also dealing with more powerful creatures such as angels, reapers, and even Death.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- [IMDB Plot Summary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460681/plotsummary)

What races/classes would you allow?

What part of the series would you insert the campaign into? (As the series goes on, more and more lore is brought into light and certain things become the norm, whereas as, in the first few seasons, things are a lot rarer).

How would you handle spellcasting and the like?

I'm curious as to how other homebrewers and DMs would approach this. I eventually want to start a campaign around this idea, but I want to at least try to keep the spirit of the lore intact, such as how humans interact with various creatures that are of a race outside of humans.

My first thought is to set it in a time that precedes the show, possibly in the Middle Ages, but at the same time, I'd also be intrigued in possibly a modern day approach, but doing so would be difficult to balance.

I'd love to hear everyone's insights!

I have tiles, props, PCs, NPCs, Monsters, and some other odd bits and bobbles I had to display visually for the players during our campaign. I will be updating the file as I add more art as our campaign evolves.

I used Piskel and have medium creatures at 16x16 (128x128P), large at 32x32 (256x256P), etc. Some creatures that are natively medium such as the Barbazu have been drawn bigger for theatric effect but can be resized to a single tile. You can easily import these files into Piskel and edit or build off of existing sprites to create something new, I do this for all of my humanoid creatures.

23rd level

3 different classes, and 1 prestige class on top of that

2,300,000 gp, but you must spend all of it.

No duplicate items

10 point-buy

And lastly, we couldn't share any classes between the 3 of us

I thought that actually making these characters would be extremely annoying, but it was rather fun to puzzle out what would work best. The 3 characters I made were:

For those that don't know, World of Warcraft has very few true deities, which is odd from a High Fantasy setting.  From a Pathfinder standpoint, most WoW deities would be strong demigods with some mythic characters throne in.  A big exception to this is Elune, the moon goddess of the Night Elves and maybe the 2nd/3rd most popular religion on Azeroth.  Recent events have led to confusion on what Elune actually is, but the relationship between Elune and her priestesses is very close to PF gods.

0,0,4,6,"Short version: Started a Pathfinder group for some people on an unrelated Discord channel. Two players agreed to join and proceed set a date and time for session 0, then never bother joining. And this GM could have been out doing something fun instead.

After today, I think I'm going to have to go to my other table and personally thank everyone there for being mature adults who are able to effectively communicate if they simply can't play over a specific weekend. Because after today, my other table has been a massive disappointment.

On a non-TTRPG Discord server, people were talking about having TTRPG games. I thought, sure, I'll sign up as a GM. I get squared away, set up, have conversations with the other potential GMs on how we want to handle things, and eventually get pointed to some potential players. Of the GMs, turns out only one other wanted to do Pathfinder and couldn't take in every player so I was given a list of players to contact. Of those players, two of them said yes while the third said probably not due to real life situations. (A fourth player contacted me to join, but ended up dropping later for reasons that I think eventually leads to bull crap but that's something else.)

So I introduce the players to Pathfinder and get a good idea of their schedule for the weekend. I also said that if they have and questions or want to run an idea by me to just shoot me a message. Only responses I get are when they are available. Now, the only time it was possible was Sunday, which is important. I post on Friday that we'll have a session 0 on Sunday a bit after noon, minding the time zones of the players. I also ask if it was alright with everyone. No response. Maybe I was foolish to assume that no reply meant they were good, but well, here I am.

Saturday rolls around, I create the game room on Roll20 and drop the invite link into the chatroom for just the players. I actually saw one of the players in the lobby at some point so I knew it was working. Sunday rolls around and about 20 minutes before the start time, I got ahead and start the server, listening for anyone to drop in as well as having Discord up for any messages. While waiting, I play around on the tutorial. 10 minutes to go, only player. 5 minutes to go, only player. At the start, still the only player. 5 minutes after, only player. I decide to wait for a whole 30 minutes, and no one shows up. No message, nothing. One player was online the entire time in Discord before going idle, another one showed up briefly on Discord then went online (also the one player who I had to make it Sunday for.) As I'm writing this, it has been almost an hour and a half and still no one has contacted me or tried to join.

And here is the thing, yes, I'm extremely salty. I stressed over this for a week which ended up being a bit of an issue as work is being stressful. I've been trying to think of strategies for dealing with two players, running some ideas by with some friends, and all to try and give two players the best experience I could give them. And this is just to go through session 0 of ""hey, what do you want to play and what do you not want to deal with?""

But here is my biggest problem with it and why having the session on Sunday just makes it worse: I had to give up racing for this session to be done this weekend. This very day, there is a race that I actually wanted to enter, but I decided to skip so that we could at least get this group going. The first race of the year, given up for players who can't even be bother to message me. You want to know when the next race is? June. Not next month, not the month after, June is the soonest I get to race.

The Escape Artist skill allows you to wriggle your way out of grabs or bindings. The Escapologist rogue archetype lets you use it to:

[Dislocate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dislocate/) (feat): Hurt yourself to lower time requirement on some EA checks. Eventually, you stop hurting yourself (good boi).

Signature Skill (feat): Just gives you a couple decent plusses to your EA skill like lowering time requirements and avoiding some effects before they happen.

Vagabond Child (Regional Trait): +1 to EA. Minor, but ~~who doesn't love a good~~ we like minor bonuses sometimes too. 

Start with a Dex of 17, get +2 from Ratfolk racial, pump that up with each level up because why not, so at level 20 you're looking at +7 there.



At this point, we're seeing a +13 to EA rolls at level 1, and a +61 to EA rolls at level 20. By level 3 we can already take 20 to get out of masterwork manacles (level one if you immediately go for Skill Focus). In 3.5, epic skill usage of EA allowed one to squeeze through a space smaller than one's own head at DC 80, and somehow friggin pass through a Wall Of Force at DC 120 (see [here](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm) for more of THAT kind of nonsense). Bear in mind, we haven't touched magic items yet. We should, but we won't in this OC. 

Other ideas of merit: 

Possessed Hand / Hand's Autonomy feats: The latter feat lets your hand act for you when you can't, sometimes. Here, it lets your hand roll any EA check for you at -4 if you couldn't already do it due to being unconscious, paralyzed, asleep, or stunned. This is now letting your demon hand force your body into contortions of both physical and mental (see Unfettered Mind) natures when you're otherwise preoccupied.

Sharptooth / Sharpclaw / Tunnel Rat / Burrowing Teeth feats: Leaning on the concept of Harry Houdini, you could go full disappearing act by learning how to tunnel on your own, too. Having a set of 3 natural weapons is already looking better than your Rogue-y BAB, just slap on a Weapon Finesse (via Finesse Rogue?) and now you've got a scrap-rat (heh). Getting out of jail is much easier when you don't need to Sleight Of Hand your weapons in! Just don't let them saw off your nat weps, mmkay? 

Skill Focus (Stealth) / Eldritch Heritage 1&amp;2 feats: Bit of a pricey feat dip here, but you have some good Stealth already so why not double dip when it comes to skills? The Shadow bloodline lets you get basically Hide In Shadow^TM with their 9th level ability, plus get 1-3/day shadowswappy Dimension Door shenanigans. Another step on the path to Houdinihood.

Think about it, an army of effectively ninjas (the sheer amount of rolls makes it more likely you'll be on the high end). But issues such as cover come up, how would one supply the necessary things (equipment, buffs, conditions, etc...) To reliable walk into a town, slaughter the populace, and walk away leaving nothing but tales of blades in the mist (i'm thinking really big fog clouds might work to let the stealth checks start rolling)

How can you get that bonus up thats going to applied to all rolls? It seems unreasonable that the +20 from invis. would work here as well (single target and all)

What other teamwork feats might go well with charnel soldiers?

I use skeletons as a default for undead, but would work as better targets for animation (probably using the skeleton template since stealth is key-ed off dex)

I've got a super invested pushy player who wants to redeem Nualia and have a fairy tale ending. She's threatened, cried, suggested losing spell slots (she's a paladin) and using up hero points (we use hero points in our game) to make that happen.

Her suggestions have been that Nualia's long lost parents of a hidden kingdom have come back to find her. At which, Nualia will magically repent and walk off to the sunset with them. Nevermind the party knows she set fire to the cathedral and killed her adoptive father.. -_____-lll

I've been hounded for months and it's getting tiring and it's killing the fun. As the party will be meeting Nualia next session in a month's time, I would like to ask the GMs here on how to pull off a ""fairytale"" ending.

Should I just give her, her ending? Anyone have something better? 

I've read other parties chopping off her corrupted arm to save her. Another has been that her ritual to remove her celestial taint causes her to birth a baby version of herself that is absolutely pure and she has to kill it. Giving the party a chance to both kill Nualia and save baby Nualia at the same time.

Both of which aren't ""very"" fairytale. Help? Anyone has any suggestions?

0,0,3,2,"So, for today's character I'm trying to make one related to the black blood, the Land of Black Blood or even viable for the Second Darkness adventure path, although other than that liquid there isn't much else to do in that vault. 

But what does it do? According to the black blooded oracle text: 

&gt; casts all necromantic spells at +1 caster level for the next 10 minutes, but takes 3d6 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage

Other than drinking it, just being in contact already affects you:

&gt; certain creatures like aberrations, undead, and black-blooded oracles possess an uncanny immunity to its effects. Any other creature that comes into contact with black blood takes 1d6 points of cold damage—10d6 points of cold damage per round if fully immersed. 

That said, the little there is about it are the bloodrager bloodline and oracle archetype, which are immune to both good and bad effects of the liquid, and get a couple of slightly bad abilities related to shooting it via injuries; and a little trait that makes you immune only to the bad effects of drinking it, which is great if you ask me. But, since I already made a very nice necromancer for another game happening in Geb (bones oracle + 2 lvls of antipaladin + agent of the grave), I'm trying to come up with something else than yet necromancer, then what does that leave us with for this occasion?

First things first, what could a character be doing there? How did it arrive? What's his goal? How did he get the black blood running through its body to begin with? So far what i got is:

* A bloodrager with the said bloodline, who also has the aberrant one (crossblooded) for extra weirdness, but i still don't know what he's doing there. 
   * An experiment from a random Drow at the Bloodforge? Perhaps it was someone from Leng or a Neothelid instead? But then, how'd he get out of there to the ""starting town"" which may or may not be in orv or even the darklands? And why would he go back down there?
* Another bloodrager with the said bloodline, but this one has Eldritch Heritage with the Ghoul bloodline. 
   * This could be related to Geb, Nemret Noktoria or even Leng itself. A character can be made a ghoul (or ghast) from many reasons, of which some could be exposure to lazurite, getting done in by a marrowstone golem or more commonly dying from ghoul fever so there are many opportunities to also obtain the Ghoul Template (which sort of makes the sorcerer ghoul bloodline redundant there). So... what's next? What does he do with that? Usurp the leadership of ghouls and become ghoul king of sorts and conquer sekamina or a vault afterwards?
* A black blooded oracle... this one is a bit of a mystery, no pun intended, and disappointment. 
   * Oracles aren't very tanky HP-wise so they shouldn't be getting the injuries they need to shoot the black blood; other than that, more than half the stuff you can find down there are aberrations and undead, who are immune to it so what's the point? Also, oracle again... guess not.
* A Hallowed Necromancer wizard with the black blood heritage trait. For this i'd need to share this bit of information also from black blooded oracle:

&gt; Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source, losing all mystical properties. [*Gentle repose*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gentle-repose) can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood’s magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. 

* This guy is a diametrically opposite to most, if not all, things related to the darklands. Who wouldn't want a substance that increases necromancy-based cure spells to kill undead? There's the Cube of Writhing Glyphs too and wizards are supposed to be scholars, right? But would he go as far as going deep into orv for that? Is it worth it? Bearing in mind that I also already made an enervation build for a PC totally unrelated to this, what other necromancy spell could I even use? Are bad touch builds still a thing? 

And there ends my little list of things *directly* related to the black blood. What else can i do in that vault that's not directly related to it? 

* Fungi: It's a very common and popular thing on all the levels of the darklands, in this vault there's the Black Mire and the Hanging Forest. Possible characters: Fungal Pilgrim Druid and Blightseeker Alchemist.
* Demons: This vault is the particular location of the demonic cults to Abraxas and Camazotz (I'm not sure if there's anyone remaining of the latter though). Possible characters: Anyone who hates demons badly enough to go Jules Verne full throttle to kill them?
* ~~Cthulhu~~ Elder Mythos: A sea of unknown depth made of a mysterious substance and that seeps from the walls? Aquatic monsters, giant worms and other sort of aberrations lurking in the dark? Cult to Orgesh and faceless statues made by some unknown being? It is pretty self-explanatory, right? Although a bit broad and stretchy imho. Possible characters: Elder Mythos Scholar... and that's pretty much it since most other things cross the line into a ~~Jojo's~~ bizarre realm of insanity and paranoia ~~right next to uncle Sheogorath's islands,~~ which is sorta hard (but strangely fun) to RP and not easy to manage in a way that won't make you machinate the death of your party members for the glory of our lord and savior ~~Cthulhu~~ Orgesh.

Fortunately, the item in question is already on d20pfsrd, but it is still so ridiculous

[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodlines-from-paizo/phoenix-sorcerer-bloodline/](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodlines-from-paizo/phoenix-sorcerer-bloodline/)

While the unicorn bloodline is also healing themed (CLW/CMW/CSW as spells known, arcana to heal allies a bit while casting any spell) at least it is not so broken as phoenix one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Bloodline Arcana**: When casting **any spell that deals fire damage**, you can instead heal your targets. The spell deals no damage, and living creatures affected by the spell **instead regain a number of** **hit points** **equal to half the fire damage** the spell would normally deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

That means that any fire spell can be a heal. While fun for blasters (half of uber optimized burning hands/scorching ray/fireball as healing), there is no clause that would protect the world from ""the healing cantrip"".

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes of thinking I see at least two ways to do it:

* Crossblooded into Elemental(fire) or Efreet to convert any damaging spell into fire
* Elemental spell metamagic + an appropriate trait

&amp;#x200B;

The spell used can be either disrupt undead (if you decide it is applicable as ""energy spell"") or a normal ray of frost/acid splash. The second option is better with blood havoc mutation (the 1lvl blood line power sucks so its no pain) + spell focus - to avoid healing 1/2 of 1 hit point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the whole thing will work as part of the blasting build - 1lvl of sorcerer / x lvls of admixture wizard etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So the result is either d6/2 (disrupt undead) or (d3+1)/2 (ray/splash + boost) of close range touch ray of healing. All at 1st level.

0,0,4,3,"Trying to form a gaming group from scratch. Today I ran a Pathfinder session for three people I met in person once before today and I wasn't really happy with it. The players skipped over lore, I was overwhelmed by all the GM's responsibilities, and I was woefully underprepared. I do recognize I have a harder time motivated myself to meet up people, let alone do the work of GMing for them if I don't already know them. I want to play Pathfinder with friends rather than strangers, but friends always start out as strangers. And that piece of meeting new people has been really difficult and stressful for me.

Do I invite people to my campaign because they're friends who happen to like Pathfinder, or do I invite people to my Pathfinder table hoping they'll eventually become my friend? Do I invite too many people and then uninvite the people who aren't my favorites or something? I mean that feels kinda wrong but part of me wants to do that just to keep my options open. How many hours should I spend with someone until I know whether or not they're someone I'd want at my table? What if I feel confident that I should know by now whether or not I want to keep someone at my table, but I just feel overall neutral or only slightly annoyed?

I understand that a creature who has SR and tries to possess or charm a protected creature, the spell resistance it has does not apply. And the warded creature keeps protected.

&gt; **Third**, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. [Spell Resistance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance) can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

I started by looking at the ability to simply increase healing done, and the one ability that does this well is the [Lesser Celestial Totem](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/celestial-totem-lesser-su/). This requires being a character with Rage Powers, and the Skald is really, really good at providing this Rage Power to all your allies.

Now, unless I'm reading something incorrectly, if you are a Phoenix Bloodline Sorcerer 1/Skald X and you cast Boiling Blood, you can grant 1 ally for every 3 Skald Levels you have the ability to heal for your Skald's Caster Level each round by spending a Standard Action to Concentrate on the spell, or simply cast it to let it run for a number of rounds equal to your Skald's Caster Level.

I feel like this is a really, really effective combination.

0,0,2,1,"We get it, a tiger druid deals more damage and is a better antimage, a summoner isn't limited only to dinosaurs and a shifter probably does better at becoming a war dinosaur.
But for this time, i really wanted to use a class based on my ever-obsession and love for dinosaurs.
Sadly, this is my first time ever building a Druid and i'm having more than just some random doubts, as Way of the Wicked gets merciless, i get to desire a more... optimized druid if i want to be more than just a magical dinosaur that screams at the ground to grow crops.

1. [what role?]

So, with the saurian shaman i get free sacred summoning (standard action instead of full round completion when summoning) on dinosaurs and reptiles.
As any druid, i get some good spells for either control, _downtime_ and somehow damage.
I have an animal companion (see you on point 2 and 3) and lastly, i get to be considered 2 levels higher for the wild shape, which at my level (7) is considered 9 if i turn into a dinosaur which gives me huge (both technically and effectively speaking) combat advantages, expecially with Grab and Rake on a pouncing juggernaut with a +6 strenght... scary!

So... what is my role? What should i fill my 5 feat slots with aside Wild Spells? Summoning 1 extra summon with 2 str and con by using 3 feats sounds a little underwhelming until i get to summon big bad creatures like ankylos or rexes (around Lv14? That's my level x2)... Should i focus more on my ability to buff and grab with feats like Dirty Fighter, Improved Grab and Greater Grab (even if, given the campaign theme i might be forced to fancy myself a player's familiar for sneaking)? Should i still pick those 3 feats to not be disturbed on higher levels? (Spell focus conjuration as a lv11 or 9th feat can sound _SO_ frustrating!)

2. [which pet to choose?]
Since i am forced by class to pick any kind of Dinosaur and the entire campaign is from 3rd party materials , (therefore out of official restrictions and bans) i was going to pick the infamous spinosaur, with his outstanding 15-19 CON and imposing 28  STR (at lv7!)
Is it wise to base my choice on the stats of the creature or should i pick something i like more such as a Giganotosaurus or a Tylosaurus? both have Grab, could try making it work as a tandem grab with my (potential) Grapple build (depending on question 1 ofc)

3. [what companion archetype?]
Looks like normal archetype is the best so far, but are there any archetypes doing better jobs with my companions? For example, the wrecker gets great anti-construct permanent buffs for a feat that i might get them later (or not, if the creature doesn't have many attacks!), a bodyguard might protect our blaster (considering they lose evasion makes me cringe knowing we have a BLASTER)  and healer (still, we have a blaster... and nothing really unallows me to just give it the feats once he reaches INT 3, a Bully might just have greater maneuvering options for potential tandem-grappling (i think i have to count as an orc for that or is there another feat helping?)
What's the general optimizing opinion on it?
Sorry, this is mostly tied to point 2 of ""what companion should i pick?""


4. [items]
This is a little bit more Mathfinder, but skipping the obvious mighty fists, mammoth helm, lesser Extend Rod, wis +X str +X or con +X We have the wild shape and armor issue: the armor either costs too much (+4 bonus is a crime!), i can't wear it (no heavy armor proficiency) or it becomes useless as i switch between Huge to Tiny (luckily enough, we have places where to store it if i don't wear it)
So, the question is Stone Plate Barding (low cost... somehow?) or waiting for Wild Stone Plate? (Unfairly expensive with the +3 from wild, that requires a blood tribute of +1 armor so, complexively +4 armor... but once i wear it, i use it even when going at the toilet! Hell, i'm getting a wand of Iron Bed just for it!)
Right now, a stone plate with my Huge form looks just the best i could ask for since the enemy hits hard (because of the strong composition, all enemies have the Advanced template), and money are valuable for a Druid that is still in need of hos bag of seeds!!!

5. [Traits]
Druids have the best tricks: wild shape for double the amount of time if i disguise myself into a familiar (compsognathus, tuatara or rhamphoryncus and so on...) to sneak into civilized places? Calling animals CR8 to train and use to fight the forces of oppressive good? (We're an evil campaign!) but what if Call Animal didn't just really work? Like, right now we have an entire wood without a single animal because it's a desecrated land... and our DM is... kinda well known to dislike cheesing via silly buggy tricks such as gifted adept (call animal)
Considering Question 1 (role) and question 4 (items), are these good traits? Taking the form of a tiny familiar kills both the whole allosaurus-line of feats and the stoneplate non-wild-armor barding... anything else besides Reactionary?

Please, forgive my wall of text full of interruptions, i really just want to not be disappointed by this class that, in many years just seemed like the ultimate dinosaur-based class (with the pets restrictions or class restrictions, many nice martial classes just really feel wasted as Dinosaur-flavouring... not as much as Druid, i mean!), thanks for the patience of reading... and please go easy on me &gt; ^ &lt;);",pathfinder_test,Please help - Dinosaur Based Druid first time!

My husband is a really good DM and is currently running a game in roll 20 using 5e that is going very well (we’ve been playing for a year now). My husband has expressed a desire to play as a PC in a long-term game and I want to learn to DM. 2+2 = I run a game for him right?! Right. Here’s the twist: my husband loves Pathfinder, wants to run one of the Paizo APs, but I only know 5e. He really talked up Pathfinder, so I was like “Sure! I’ll learn this system so we can do this thing. Sounds fun!” We settle on Rise of the Runelords, get all the necessary book (yay humble bundle), and I’m researching away. I even ran We Be Goblins for a group of friends to try to get a feel for the system. 

After my research and the one shot I have a lot of misgivings about Pathfinder as a system. I know my husband and thousands upon thousands of people love it though, so I have to wonder if there is something that I am missing. I’ve decided to share some of my concerns here in the hopes that you fine people can help me see how these things are addressed in game mechanics or how DMs handle them in a good way. 

Stat damage/Losing a level – These two things seem like a very feel bad mechanic to me. 

I understand that in some situations these penalties are temporary, but not all of them. My main concern is that these types of mechanics seem like they would lead to a ‘death spiral.’ You fail a save, take stat or level reduction, which makes it harder for you to pass saves to either remove the damage or prevent further damage of this type. Rinse, repeat a couple times and you have gimped/useless or dead PCs.   

Move Actions – I have not been able to wrap my head around some of these. Most of them make sense, but on the whole move actions seem very restrictive. My brain just rejects the idea that a character can’t draw a weapon while walking towards an enemy. My wizard can’t fire an orison, grab a piece of paper off a desk he’s next to, then move a few feet on his turn? Grabbing a piece of paper makes it so the PC can’t move? Is this game mechanic designed this way for balance of action economy? If that is the case it seems narritively terrible ☹ 

Overall Deadly – so I’m reading through RotRL and really liking the story. Then, I come to the part 4 of book 2: Misgivings. This place seems designed to straight up kill PCs. Haunts dealing wisdom, strength, charisma damage- or that can straight up kill a PC for failed saves, multiple chances to contract Vorel’s Phage or Ghoul Fever. I'm not sure how the players are supposed to actually survive all this.

During my We Be Goblins game, I am certain if I had stuck strictly to the move action rules that the game would have been a tpk during the Vorka fight, despite good tactics on the part of the players.

Is Pathfinder simply a deadlier system than I am used to? Are PC deaths a common/expected thing?

Please understand, I’m not trying to pooh-pooh Pathfinder as a system. These are real concerns I have about these mechanics leading to playing a game that is just not fun. As such I am looking for insight into the system and how these things are handled. Thank you all for your time.",pathfinder_test,Please help me like Pathfinder

0,0,33,277,"I'm running a campaign with four paladin PCs called **SMITE EVIL**. They started at 3rd level - all riding up to the same crossroads at the same time - and currently the party is 18th level, adventuring inside Rovagug's cage. This past Sunday, I experienced one of those moments where things are so absurd they become awesome.

Apologies for purists about PF canon.

Let me begin with the setting.

For the sake of my game, I decided that **Rovagug**'s greatest power is that he consumes divinity. Any god in his presence is rendered mortal. If he strikes a mortal, he temporarily severs them from the ability to use or receive divine magic. It was basically impossible for the gods to kill him, because every god he killed just made him stronger. Instead of slaying him, they sealed him away in the cage in the center of Golarion. There he sleeps, and his dreams of destruction manifest as a landscape of long-dead worlds constantly being torn apart.

Though Rovagug is trapped in slumber, every once in a while a god dies on the surface of Golarion, and Rovagug draws some of that god's essence into the cage with him. If he gets enough strength, he might awaken and break free of his cage, which is why the gods generally aren't reckless enough to meddle in mortal affairs.

Another thing I added is that Asmodeus locked a legion of loyal devils inside the cage to keep tabs on the Rough Beast. They are commanded by an archdevil who had once been a duke of hell - **Egal the Shimmering**, whose purview is greed, mercenaries, and creators of magnificent treasure.

https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/738/581/large/eleni-tsami-medea.jpg?1431942393

The party had a long road getting here, and the whole tale is more complicated than is necessary to explain for this story. Suffice it to say, they're trying to rescue some innocents and stop some villains, and this next session, the world might end. 

But first, they kitted up with tons of magic items to deal with whatever they might find, and entered the cage. During a few days of exploring, they encounter remnants of long-dead gods, whose essence was pulled into the cage. They have a harrowing experience talking down **Dou-Bral** as he's trapped in a cycle slowly going mad and turning into **Zon-Kuthon** every few days. They find a shattered metal angel with a halo like an angry red eye (our play group previously played through the **Iron Gods** adventure path). They find a hollow mummy of **Ptah**, one of the Osirioni gods who never made it over from the Egyptian pantheon.

In Ptah's tomb, they found a lich named **Sorvab** who pitifully asked to die. Our Shelynite paladin, **Thaddeus**, took mercy on the thing and learned that Sorvab had once been a mortal man on a truly ancient world that Rovagug destroyed before he ever came to Golarion. Sorvab had created a minor artifact that was both a *mirror of life trapping* and a *mirror of opposition*. Made of polished gold, it would consume the soul of anyone who touched it and replace their soul with one of a diametrically opposed alignment. It could only hold one soul at a time.

He had offered it as a gift to Egal the Shimmering, hoping to get Hell's assistance in saving his world. Instead, Egal tested the mirror on Sorvab, creating a loyal minion, whom he commanded to become a lich so he could serve forever. When Rovagug threatened Golarion and Asmodeus set Egal to the task of controlling the inside of the cage, Sorvab came too. He lacked the mindless discipline of the devils, so he started to go mad and deserted, fleeing into a distant spot in the nightmarish landscape within the cage. Now he simply wanted to die, to have his phylactery destroyed, because he was convinced he would never escape.

Thaddeus offered instead to recover the mirror and restore Sorvab's soul, and perhaps make him alive again. 

To reach the people they wanted to rescue, the paladins would have to make it past the Golden Legion anyway, and so Tad hoped he would find the mirror in their fortress. When they approached the fortress, they were met by a messenger carrying a big cauldron of gold coins. He poured them out, and they levitated, forming Egal the Shimmering's face. To the party's surprise, Egal said he didn't care if they went any further, as long as they didn't interfere with Asmodeus's plans: namely, don't free Rovagug.

Since apparently a fight wasn't going to happen, Tad asked if maybe they could buy something from him. A bit of bartering later, and the party trades a few hundred thousand GP worth of stuff for the mirror. With surprisingly little fanfare, they let Sorvab touch the mirror, which obliterates his lich body and replaces it with his mortal body and his original, not-evil soul. 

Riding high on their victory (and high on their horses), the paladins travel past the fortress of the golden legion to their ultimate destination, a palace that holds a prisoner they intend to rescue. Here's where I make a silly error.

They find a sword on the ground with a green crystal blade, and beside it a cracked statue of an imposing man with Azlanti features. They realize this is a fragment of Aroden. Whatever may have killed him, a piece of him ended up here.

I'm just thinking, hey, this will be a fun bit of mystery, because they'll know Aroden is dead, but still won't know why. It's a big part of the setting, and even now, the answer is hidden from them.

The paladin of Ra, **Akhenra**, pipes up that he has a *scroll of true resurrection*, which works as long as the person died in the past 170 years. Aroden died 111 years ago.

Someone points out that he's not just dead; he's petrified.

Don't worry, says Akhenra. My *lay hands* can cure petrification through a mercy.

I decide at that point that one of the things Asmodeus definitely doesn't want is Aroden coming back, even as a mortal, to make trouble. So the Golden Legion starts lopping trebuchet buckets of lava at the party, which arc for a few miles and start landing around them. They are not deterred, however, and restore Aroden from petrification, then abscond with his body to a safe distance, at which point they revive him. He has lost his divine powers, but he's still, like, canonically a very high level spellcaster, and I figure he's wished himself to have super high stats.

Of course they ask him how he died. So I kinda broke a cardinal rule of the PF setting by answering that. Oops?

He's disturbingly *not* selfless, but he's certainly got a grudge against Hell. So they make a plan to storm the Golden Legion's fortress.

The crux of that plan is this. Aroden disguises everyone with *invisibility* and *mind blank* from a distance, they fly into Egal's throne room with flight magic on their steeds and such, and then they kick ass. A group of 20th level paladins do a *number* on a throne room filled with high-level devils -- Akhenra solos a pit fiend over the span of two turns, Thaddeus and his horse both with Combat Reflexes tear apart a phalanx of bearded devils, our archer **Marthel** kills some invisible horned devils, and so on. 

And then there's Egal the Shimmering, with basically the statblock of CR 25 Amon, Duke of Hell (3rd party - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-amon-duke-of-hell-tohc), plus I added some special powers like conjuring a treasure hoard avalanche, and greedily copying any spells other casters use around him. The fiend is exceptionally powerful. But even exceptionally powerful dukes of hell can fail saving throws.

So when the rest of the party is distracting him, Egal doesn't notice Aroden run up beside him, take the golden mirror like a two handed bludgeon, and bonk the archdevil in the face. One shitty saving throw later, and the party has a freshly minted Chaotic Good empyreal lord on their side.

&amp;#x200B;

The boss had some custom mechanics (similar to legendary/lair actions in 5E or boss mechanics in video games) and while I try to telegraph stuff, I don't think that's going to work 100% of the time.  Either I won't make it as clear in-game as it needs to be or the players will misread the situation or both.  The question then is how to handle the resulting TPK (or at least near TPK).

&amp;#x200B;

I think we need to decide on some general principles going forward.  Without risk of death/loss, I feel the game has less meaning.  On the flip side, if there's, say, four boss fights per level and you succeed 95% of the time, that's likely several more TPKs by the end of the campaign (this is assuming you never die to lesser encounters which technically could also happen).  There's at least three main options: 

&amp;#x200B;

1, ""IT WAS ALL A DREAM!"" I don't really like this option, I think it cheapens death and makes failing meaningless.

&amp;#x200B;

2, reset but with consequences.  people have mentioned the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor.  In this case it would probably be something like the encounter you just wiped to getting a small boost across the board while you get a second chance.  If you die again, it gets boosted more.  if this happens a few times it's going to become impossible and it becomes a TPK.  So you get a few chances but that's it -- and it's a bit harder each time.

Part of the concern here is also disruption of plotlines.  If one person dies (falls into lava and there's nothing left to rez, let alone raise dead) then that can already disrupt stuff and that's ""good"" because death should be meaningful...but it's a far cry short of jettisoning every NPC connection/character arc and resetting with a new party.

TL/DR: My players insist on being diplomats instead of dungeon divers and have begun bribing a grindylow to help them bribe other grindylow with alcohol. And bluff their leader into thinking the grindylow have an army.

The set-up is that my players are about halfways through the first book still. They have finished checking out the town, found the choker caves while investigating Levin Farm and cleared that out right then and there, took their boat back to meet up with the rest of the colonists instead of hiking there, which caused them to skip the incutilis and finding the jack warden trail. They defused the boat situation expertly, and instead of immediately dealing with the grindylows they sailed back to the colony and rested up before heading back to the cave, which is where we started the session. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because we are short a PC I started them at level 2, and they were still level 2 going into the grindylow cave. In the entrance to the cave they take out 2 grindylows in under 1 round, stabilize them both, and the Paladin decides she wants to parley with the clan instead of committing genocide. Luckily the Gillman Archaeologist speaks aquan and can communicate, so he gets things rolling. They come to an agreement with one of the grindy's (which we named Groose after the zelda character) that he would go with them if they gave him grog and supported his claim for chieftain if/when Brinetooth dies. They spend the next 2 hours of real time talking to Groose and Ramona arranging the best way to ally themselves with the grindylow tribe and trying to put together a suitable gift for the grindylow chieftain. And due to a very good bluff roll (on the Paladin's part of all characters!) Ramona now thinks that hundreds of grindylow surround the island/colony. I had to end the session there because I have no solid idea how to proceed with this.

Bestiary 1 PG 248 states:
&gt;*Shock (Su) Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock
to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8
points of nonlethal electricity damage to living
opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). This save DC
is Constitution-based. Additionally, if
two or more shocker lizards are within
20 feet of each other, they can work
together to create a lethal shock once
every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a
radius of 20 feet, centered on any
one contributing lizard. All creatures

a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save

So by my understanding, when the lizards do a group shock the players will have to roll a DC of 22 or take 12d8 damage. 

Here's my question. How does this attack happen? Say I roll that the lizards can shock every 2 rounds. On the first Lizard's first turn does he activate this attack and then all the Lizards turns are skipped because he used this attack? Or would it be more like all the lizards aid the last lizard and he activates it? 
Or do all the lizards get separate attacks? Or do I for that one round have them attack as though they were a swarm? I am unsure how this works.

####Appearance

Ornate armor covers this hulking creature, rocky protrusions jutting from its hide and fierce horns crowning its broad head.
  

####CR   20
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Gargantuan
####Special Abilities  

Armor Training (Ex) An akvan is created wearing armor, and is naturally experienced in its use. An akvan possesses the armor training ability of a 15th-level fighter.

Aura of Hopelessness (Su) All creatures except divs within 30 feet of an akvan must make a successful DC 30 Will save or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Create Ghul (Su) Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Shake Faith (Su) Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Torturous Gullet (Su) As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan’s stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well.

Akvans seek out wonders to destroy—monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan’s evil does not end with its victim’s death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield—or are belched up from an akvan’s gullet—as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves.

Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile.

Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds.
Akvan Princes
As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes.

Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4–8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22­–24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts.

Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish.

Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains resist fire 30, an efreeti’s heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like abilities: at will—quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day—wish.

Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will—invisibility; 3/day—gaseous form, wish.

Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid’s water’s fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like abilities: constant—water breathing, water walk; at will—quickened control water; 3/day—horrid wilting, wish.

Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity 20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will—ethereal jaunt, invisibility; 3/day—insanity, mage’s disjunction, wish.

0,0,4,3,"When making an app to a game you may be really excited about this character idea you had, maybe you found some REALLY COOL art and your super excited to make that particular character and go in and have a good time.  And there's nothing wrong with that, the point of this post isn't to tell you not to do that because you should.

&amp;#x200B;

But what you should do is take a look at what the token art the other PCs are using is and use that to temper your expectations or even determine if that game is right for you before you even post an Player App in the LFG.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you found this art of a grizzled barbarian warrior drawn in a hyper realistic style and it's cool and you love it....but maybe it's not the right thing for the game of Magical Girl Princess Power. The inverse also being true, I've had dozens and dozens of people post 12 year old anime girls to the LFG pages of my dark gothic horror games. And maybe those apps are REALLY GREAT CHARACTERS that I want in my game very much and maybe the players are the best around, but seeing this Loli nestled in with dour steampunk oil stained hardarses just....well it draws me out and makes me warry of that character. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it doesn't even have to be a tonal thing. You maybe love drawing your own tokens but your art skills are.....not quite there yet. It can unintentionally give a bad impression when you post this stick figure in with the group of guys who spent a couple hundred dollars each to have their tokens custom made by professional artists. 

&amp;#x200B;

and then there's sexual content, Maybe you think that loin clothed, pasties on her boobs, elf wench is really awesome, but maybe the group just isn't really going for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make isn't "" Your wrong to post that "" my point isn't "" Lol Anime sucks get it out of here "" rather the point I want to make is that pictures speak a thousand words and when I see your token, more so than alot of your backstory is going to color my impression of your character and you as a player and when I'm sifting through a dozen applications that can make a very big difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this goes both ways also! Maybe you want that anime ninja character or that guy who's got a flaming sword and armor and glowing eyes and lightning bolt cape at level 1. Looking at the token art other people post can give you a good impression if it's worth posting in that LFG, See a bunch of other Anime portraits? Your gonna feel right at home! Nobody likes being the odd man out afteral.

If you are currently in the Rise of the Runelords campaign with Nicolas, Etrigan, John Wood, and Dr. Keel, kindly read no further.

My players are on chapter 5 of Rise of the Runelords, and have recently entered &gt;!the Runeforge demiplane!&lt;. As described in the book, 

&gt;!""Runeforge follows many of the “rules” of the Material Plane as if the complex were still a part of it. Gravity works the same,

0,0,13,4,"New to Pathfinder! My group of friends is trying it out to see how we like it, and I've decided to make a character inspired by Dante (from the Devil May Cry series.png) using the Synthesist Summoner. As you can imagine with all of the required reading and lack of experience, I'm having a hard time deciding on the fine details of my build and would like some guidance. I'm not looking to make the most optimized character or a 1:1 rendition of Dante, just something conceptually close: a fun loving melee combatant with a huge sword, a devil trigger, and a handful of tricks up his sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've decided on Demon Spawn Tiefling for my race. My GM is allowing me to trade in some stuff to get that trait that lets Tieflings wield larger weapons. With 20 point buy my stats pre-racials are 14 12 12 7 14 16 in that order. Also of note, since I have no interest in actually summoning anything aside from my refluffed Eidilon, my GM has allowed me to trade out access to summoning spells as well as the Summon Monster SLA for extra feats when I would otherwise upgrade Summon Monster. Not sure how (un)balanced that is, but it seemed the simplest solution.

&amp;#x200B;

The two areas I'm most uncertain of is how high of an emphasis I need to place on my charisma score, and also the main form of attack for my fused state. I don't plan to cast much outside of utility and buff spells, so I imagine I don't need my charisma score all that high; however, I'm unfamiliar with the system as a whole so I don't know if there's a reason I shouldn't leave my charisma sitting around 18. As for modes of attack, I'm definitely going biped with manufactured weapons and at least one big sword. My initial conception was having four arms to two hand a greatsword while also having two free hands for casting, but I'm also considering wielding x number of greatswords. I can't picture my devil trigger state having a ton of arms, and I'm not even sure how effective that is in the first place, so insight is appreciated.

My GM is pretty good and we can talk with him about a lot of things. Except fumble rules. Got him to at least have a confirmation roll for attack fumbles because otherwise my ranger would be dead by level 7 by killing himself with an arrow through his throat or, as already happened, by cutting into my own leg with my axe. I'm ok with that, still hurts builds needing weapons or attack rolls more but I can live with that.  


What I just don't like is that he wants to have fumbles for skill checks, without confirmation, because otherwise there ""wouldn't be so many fumbles"". That lead to my ranger lvl 3, sneak bonus of +9, to yell for my bow in the midst of the night (Nat 1, instead of just getting it ready with stealthiness of 10) while 4 goblins were under our tent ""city"" in the trees. Since the skill check fumble rate will always be a flat 5 %, regardless of being a commoner or a lvl 20 master hunter,  I'm looking for builds that either aren't subject to these rules that let me feel like a dumbass trying to do heroic things as often or something else to mitigate these effects in any way.  


I will definitely bring it up next time at the full table that it bothers me, including me deciding for my character that he was ordered home for orc-reasons (dwarf) if this rule will stay. I would like to play a character that I can get invested to, that's why I'm looking for builds/guides/tips/tricks/whatever to not fail miserably 5 % of the times.

0,0,1,1," With Pathfinder 2.0 coming up as the the main focus, I thought I'd take a shot at getting some questions answered over the blade adept, especially after playing it for a while.

There is a lot of argument on how the blade adept works.

So here goes (Please note that this is not in terms of PFS but home games):

1) The blade adept's black blade cannot be enhanced, like the magus's black blade, correct? This is despite this being a bonded object? This is to avoid an enhancement issues for game mechanics, correct?

2) Does the black blade maintain any enhancement prior to becoming a black blade?

3) The arcanist's arcane reservoir replaces the magus's arcane pool. How is the arcane reservoir points calculated? 3 + arcanist level or 1/3 arcanist level + intelligence (because of the black blade feature)?

4) The magus feature is described as the arcane pool. If the arcanist's reservoir replaces the arcane pool, can the arcanist use the reservoir to enhance the black blade like how the magus can enhance the black blade?  The black blade has it's own arcane pool.  Can you use it to enhance the black blade?

5) Why pick blade adept over vmc magus? They appear to have roughly the same amount of tradeoffs and benefits. For every increase to the black blade, vmc magus can also enhance the weapon, but do it better and with any weapon. The lost feats were likely to be spent on metamagic or item creation, which can be acquired through the arcanist exploits you saved.

Basically, from what I've seen:

Blade adept:   
\- 3 exploits   
\- Eldritch Blade   
\- Spell Strike

VMC Magus:   
\- 3 exploits (metamagic)   
\- Broad Study   
\- Trade in for Spell Strike   
\- No sentient weapon bonuses - Trade for familiar?

Both of these allow me to get Arcane Accuracy which was the biggest appeal to me.

Accurate strike from VMC is also pretty appealing.

I am looking for a good one night module that is isn't too hard for newer players to handle, but that will still be fun! My thoughts are 3rd level, gives players a bit more to play with compared to 1st level, but still simple enough. Ill most likely have them use pre-generated characters.

Have any good ones in mind?

If it helps I have been a GM before for a 2 night adventure, but that was a few years ago. I am a green GM overall.

**Situation:**

Our group is continuing a game we had intended to be a single, one day campaign (5th Level Characters, celtic theme, nothing crazy class wise). We had no healer so I decided to jump on that grenade and was going to play an Oradin build (Paladin/Oracle). DM thought it didn't fit his world so I went strait [Divine Herbalist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/archetypes/paizo-oracle-archetypes/divine-herbalist/) Life Oracle with the deaf curse.

**Revelations:** Healers Way, Life Link, [Healing Hands,](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/mysteries/paizo-oracle-mysteries/life/)

**Equipment:** [Healer's Satchel](https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Healer%27s%20SatchelNormal), [Boline](https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Boline)

**Skill checks:** Heal = 14 (5 ranks, +2 Wisdom modifier, +3 skill bonus, +4 Healing Hands revelation), Knowledge (Planes) = 5 ranks

[Healer's Hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/conduit-feats/healers-hands-conduit/) allows you to make a treat deadly wound check as a full-round action (with other bonuses on success), [Incredible Healer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/incredible-healer/) allows you to heal target equal to Heal check when attempting to treat deadly wounds, [Healing Hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/mysteries/paizo-oracle-mysteries/life/) gives you a +4 bonus on healing checks, [Healer's Satchel](https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Healer%27s%20SatchelNormal) in a healer's kit that gives +2 circumstance bonus to Heal checks (with other bonuses on success), and [Bolines](https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Boline) allows you to expend only one usage of your Healer's Satchel instead of two to treat deadly wounds.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue/argument arose when I attempted my first Heal check to treat deadly wounds in combat on our fighter. Against a DC20 check, my resulting Heal check was 43  \[18 (roll) + 14 (Heal skill) + 2 (Satchel) + 4 (Satchel wisdom bonus) + 5 (Knowledge Planes ranks)\]. DM first thought I counted wrong (I double checked), then accused me of using 3rd party material (I didn't), and then accused me of Power gaming to the point of breaking the game with the help of online forums (. . .I did utilize the help of the interwebs).

While I'm not playing, I devise plans to save my party's butt from different situations, and today's disaster is ""everyone is down, i'm the only person up"".

 My first instinct as an Arcanist is to nope the hell out of there with my companions, so Dimensional Slide, Swift Action Bloodline Development Vestige Bloodline to use a bound item to cast Teleportation to get me and my friends to a safe place.

While this is the main plan, I doubt everyone in going to be in range of my teleportation spell (the paladin and the warrior might be 20 fts apart from each other), and so I asked myself, if I use a Reach Metamagic Rod (or the feat), does it increase the range of people I can teleport from Touch to Close? Or is the Teleportation range that gets increased? By RAW I would say the first since the ""range"" is ""personal and touch"", but later the spells specify that there is need of contact between the targets.

Edit: I'll add that the Reach Spell feats specify that you can't apply it to spells that lack the range of Touch, Close or Medium, and since the Teleport ""travel range"" is none of these, I suspect that you can't increase it with said feat, leaving the ""personal and touch"" the only increasable part, but the need of contact still confuses me.

So to start I threw them all into jail together as an obligatory sticking them together to avoid the tavern of awkward. There were a few things to do in the jail as I burned down the village they were in around them to establish some immediate tension. 

 Immediately two of them start putting out fires and the wizard decides to go look for a shop cause he loves fucking with rich assholes. But everything is on fire so yeah stuff happens and some raiders are robbing a store and he stops them. Then steals the stuff they're stealing. 

So we go back to the two putting fires out and they go on and save a bunch of people from burning buildings rather than fight the pillagers with the guards. They're not a very combat orientated group. 

Eventually things calm down and all the saved people vouch for the party so the guards pardon them and let them go. At this point the party introduces themselves to each other and go get drink in a tavern for shenanigans. 

The wizard checks his items he stole and discovers a bag of gold, a bag of uncut gems, and a bag of magic dust for an unknown use. But he also notices that there is also ordinary sand in the bag. So he goes off to the shop he stole it from and blackmails the shopkeep into buying his silence for conning people. 

We take a short break around this time because I expected the prison break to take longer and have to plan some on the fly shit now. 

We come back from the break and one of them suggests talking to the captain of the guard about the raid. They discover through some rp that this is a common occurrence and the raiders are in fact slavers who kidnapped the blacksmith's daughter. 

After talking to the blacksmith and another guard they get the girl's description and a possible location for the slavers. 

Next they decide to gather supplies for the trip so they go and visit that shopkeeper that the wizard stole from earlier. After a bit of rp and haggling they get some legitimate supplies and head off to the cave. 

They get to the cave and there are two slavers keeping watch. They develope a plan and it almost works. But then everything went wrong. The rogue missed the sneak attack, the illusionists spell failed, and the excleric couldn't get in fast enough with their heavy armor.

0,0,14,29,"So we just finished the first adventure of RotRL and things have been going swimmingly. However, on player just announced she will be dropping from the game as she is getting busy with her kiddos (perfectly understandable). 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that she has been Aldern's obsession. He started out being a bit too clingy to her and inappropriately giving her all the credit for saving him. They chose not to go on the boar hunt as they had a feeling he was creepy and it was a trap. After that though he left a gift of a masterwork composite longbow for her when he left and has not returned. I have played up small items of hers having gone missing as well... but no one really seemed to notice for too long as other events just kept occuring. During the downtime between adventures she even talked about maybe looking him up... she had definitely come to think of him more fondly when nothing bad had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

With her leaving I am really disappointed both that all of that foreshadowing and setup went in to setting her up as the perfect target of his obsession as well as now having lost the opportunity to make it be whomever I am going to have to target next... just bummed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... other suggestions? I hate killing off a character after their player leaves the game, but it seems that Aldern letting his obsession get to him might be the perfect thing. She just goes missing and no one knows where she is. When they get to the mansion they see painting that look almost just like her (she described her character very similar to what Iesha looks like in the art)... then they find her body when they get down stairs to finally confront Aldern along with the table holding all of the little curious of hers he had acquired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another possibility that occurred to me was actually replacing Iesha with her. She had a whirlwind romance after the last adventure, got married and things played out very similarly. Not sure I like this though as it messes with the timeline and opens a lot of questions... like why the PCs weren't invited to any wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I need to pick a new obsession. I have never liked the non-lust options as much and especially with no time to prep any foreshadowing... I am more at a loss of how to proceed. I suppose it could be fun to try and frame one of the characters for the murders as time goes on... maybe the low RP halfling cavalier. Not sure if that would really help pull the player in more or be something he just doesn't care about.

I've been extensively researching my spell choices online and as the game has progressed I find myself drifting away more and more from some universally praised choices like Fireball, Stinking Cloud, and Stone Call. Black tentacles is in reach now but I just don't see myself taking it, despite how great it sounds. It just feels like a waste of a slot when I'm unlikely to have a good opportunity to cast it without hitting my allies.

My party (monk, ranger, rogue, bard) has pretty high initiative, and while mine is up among the highest, more often than not at least one ally is in the way of AoE when my turn comes. Worse still, the Spire in general seems like a pretty cramped place. Usually when combat starts, we're already too close to the enemy for a fireball or a cloud, even if I asked whoever is ahead of me to delay.

That's not to say I never use AoEs. Early on I got a few good color sprays off. And there was one boss encounter I managed to launch a fireball from a scroll to good effect. But nine times out of ten, it just ain't happening. Because of this, I find myself taking more targeted spells like Burning Arc, Slow, and Icy Spears and not picking up Fireball, Stinking Cloud, or Black Tentacles. I've had Web for a few sessions but still haven't had a good chance to use it.

Now, I'm not complaining per say. I don't have any regrets (other than not realizing how many more spells I would know if my PC were human). I'm pretty happy with my spell choices and our party has been doing well. **I'm just curious why my experience seems so different than most I've read.**

0,0,20,14,"Hey guys! My group is currently wrapping up our first campaign that's lasted about two and a half years and gearing up for campaign two. In the first campaign I played a gnome sorcerer who was the lone moral compass in a group of morally grey characters with some murder hobo-y tendencies. I wanted to flip that in the next campaign and play a more morally neutral battle-cleric (life and death are both natural states, honor is paramount, basic lawful neutral stuff).

Without going too deep into my character's backstory, he doesn't know which god gave him his powers and, since our DM created the world we're playing in as well as his own pantheon, I let him pick the deity that was most in line with my character. I didn't find out until later that she is a lawful evil deity.

I wasn't expecting that but I think it could be really cool plot-wise and I'm really looking forward to playing him but I'm not sure how to get the most out of the character mechanically. He's got pretty low charisma so I dont think I'll be using channel energy too often aside from channel smite to get a little extra damage on melee attacks. I'm toying with the idea of focusing on necromancy so that ""those who were dishonorable in life can have a chance to redeem themselves in death"" but I'm not too sure yet.

I have decided to run a one-shot one (or two) nights while we're staying in our cabin with nothing much better to do.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is that I'm not sure about how to approach the game with them. I have written two brief intro adventures that will give me the option of doing either:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Giving the players a choice of pre-gen characters, including background story, character traits, objectives etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Giving them blank slate characters that are basically 'fresh souls' in story terms and have no experiential memories (although their bodies retain some 'muscle memory' that explains their skills/knowledges/abilities etc - there is then future RP potential for discovering who their body was via physical characteristics (tattoos, being recognised, etc) that becomes part of the story). This lets me, as GM, guide them in situations in a more seamless, narrative way (ie, something tells you that you could probably balance across this narrow ledge etc).  


&amp;#x200B;

The question is: what are people's experiences with total new players, how do they respond to RP elements, what are some challenges people have found in this space and how do you overcome them?

0,0,24,11,"I am just wondering if there is some esoteric rule I am forgetting that makes this super cheesy build NOT work..  


The basic concept is that you take a half-orc or orc archer(doesn't seem to matter a huge deal what the base class is) and through use of other character buffs or item buffs you make something truly disgusting.   


First step is to give our monstrosity a Orc Hornbow(2d6). Step 2 is to cast enlarge person on him, he becomes large sized, and so with his new size his bow would go up to a Large sized Orc Hornbow(3d6). Through further magic, we apply the Gravity bow spell and now the Large Orc Hornbow counts as one size larger for damage(4d6). I am pretty certain at this point we are still RAW, however we can go further and I am wondering if this crosses the line.  


If our Orc siege weapon here were to get an enchantment of Growing Weapon on his bow, then we are looking at a Large Orc Hornbow, that for 10 minutes a day he can make a Huge Orc Hornbow(6d6) and use without penalty. If we want to get even more wonky the Orc Archer could use a Large Hornbow from the get go, sure he takes a -2 but think of the pay off when we apply all our buffs and the final result is a Large Orc wielding a Huge Growing Orc Hornbow with gravity bow on top of it for 8d6 per arrow.

####Appearance  

A contemplative humanoid face framed by a cobra-like hood adorns the body of this long, brightly colored serpent.

####CR   10
#####Alignment:  LG
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Poison (Ex) Bite—injury or spit—contact; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spells A guardian naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a guardian naga.

Spit (Ex) A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobra-like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds.

While many guardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder—towering waterfalls, natural spires, mountaintop temples—minding them out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder’s charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.

I'm drawing inspiration from the movie [Eagle Eye](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059786/): the system organizes a massive coup d'etat that would kill a lot of the heads of state, until the calculated ""best candidate for the government"" is the next in line of succession.

0,0,158,150,"[Vital strike](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat/) isn't exactly bad so much as it is a victim of its own coolness.

&amp;#x200B;

The feat theoretically has a niche fulfilling a specific fantasy, that of the powerful warrior who finishes off foes [in a single blow](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F20KSmo8aJ7HYu5L0rf%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;f=1). You don't need a second hit--one is enough. It's pretty badass if you can pull it off.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend Bob sees the feat and he thinks ""wow, I'd love to make a character centered around that!"" Bob proceeds to use the feat chain as a build-around. He goes out of his way to find the largest possible weapons, invests in the whole feat chain, picks up other feats to support the strategy, and then spends every possible round of combat vital-striking.

&amp;#x200B;

This build is bad bad bad. A vital strike is not as good as a full-attack action in most cases. Bob gets screwed over by effects like *blur* or *mirror* image. There will be turns when Bob naturally rolls low on the d20, effectively loses all his attacks for the turn, and feels bad. And even if Bob hits, the payoff isn't really there; it probably doesn't deal more damage per round than a full attack even in the best case scenario. The feat simply isn't good enough to support an entire character concept.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's secretly a great utility feat. Rather than making it a build-around, you can slap it onto martial characters for circumstantial value.

&amp;#x200B;

The first use for the feat is mobility. Combat in Pathfinder typically rewards martial characters for planting their feet and full-attacking. And one of the advantages that casters have over warriors is the ability to cast their spell for the round and then move, getting the most out of their action economy without compromising their effectiveness. Vital strike stretches out your action economy, allowing you to move without missing out on the entire value of a full attack. If moving and then attacking is two actions, think of moving and then using a vital strike as 2.5 actions.

&amp;#x200B;

How to benefit from the mobility? Finish off an injured enemy and then start moving on to the next one. Use it instead of a charge action, to deal more damage when the enemy has low AC, or when the terrain doesn't allow charging. Walk around the enemy's cover and then shoot them with a vital strike musket ball. Or hit a powerful enemy and then walk away to bait out its AoO for the turn.

&amp;#x200B;

The second use is damage reduction. Ideally you'd get around DR by using the correct weapons. But sometimes you won't have a silver holy bullet when you entered the dungeon prepared to fight fairies, and found devils instead. That's ok--vital strike is naturally good against DR.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, vital strike can be great for the surprise round. The goal of a good ambush is to end the battle before it begins, but this is often difficult in Pathfinder. Sometimes there are low-HP, high-value targets who need to die in a single round. Sentries will survive the first hit and raise an alarm, or wizards will survive and teleport away. Vital strike isn't a silver bullet to this problem, but it helps. You can't take a full attack action in the surprise round anyway, so vital strike can be another way to turn your one standard action into 1.5 standard actions. Some characters like rangers or slayers may be able to creep all the way up into melee before combat begins. Archers and gunslingers may get off a vital strike shot from concealment before combat begins. If you have a stealthy martial character, consider taking this feat.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

&amp;#x200B;

**The best thing about vital strike** is that it can be made to do a lot of work for a small investment. Picking up a single feat (or maybe two, if you're a fighter with feats to spare) is enough to generate value in a wide variety of circumstances. Just be sure you use it judiciously, and not as your main mode of attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**The worst thing about vital strike** is that it doesn't do a very good job of supporting the fantasy that it represents. Bob will probably never chop a pit fiend in half with one blow, and he'll sacrifice a lot of power in the futile quest to do so. He may land OHKOs on weak enemies, but it won't support an entire character concept the way that he wants it to, unless he plays at a really-power table.",pathfinder_test,Vital strike discussion (inspired by trap option thread)

At Rimeskull were our heroes

A mystery to crack!

When they woke up fearsome Arkryst

Who thought “I could use a snack”

And the dragon breathed his wrath on them

A mighty, icy sneeze!

Never thinking that that was the day

That’d he be killed with bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

The heroes reeled and scattered

Any lesser folk would crumble

As the dragon eyed their haunches

With his belly all a’rumble

And as he drifted out of reach

Of bear and orc with ease

He thought “There’s no way this is the day

That I’ll be killed with bees”

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

They might have died right then and there

But Prinella got to healin’

And Hamphrey conjured figments

Of some folk doin’ some stealin’

And Kieran conjured up a wall

Of unseen energies

Still the dragon, hale and hearty,

Feared no blades or spells or bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

&amp;#x200B;

The bear and orc got in some licks

The beast was not impressed

And he looked upon his quarries

To see which would taste the best

He snatched up Kieran in his jaws

Thinking “Tastes a bit like cheese,”

And breathed a final icy blast

Before he died from bees

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

Then Pow’ll and Hamphrey linked their hands

And with great courageous flare

Did teleport athwart its back

As it sped on through the air

“I will not die from stabbings by

Such nasty mites as these!”

He cried, when Pow’ll struck – correct!

For he would die from bees.

Ohhhhh bees bees bees bees! They killed the beast with bees!

Kieran took the final key,

By Prinella’s grace, alive

And Arkryst tried to crush his foes

In a final fatal dive

He with his breath could freeze

The halfling nocked his swarmbow:

They killed the beast with bees.

I'm going to be running it in a few weeks but I'm a bit concerned it's going to be hard to wrap up well. We'll only have a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

The plot is that a wizard shows up at your village looking for adventurers to test 300 ""glitchy"" wands of magic missile and is willing to pay you 1000 gold each to do so. To tidy up the use-magic-item plothole, I'm going to be saying they're prototypes designed to be used by the magically unskilled knights of the kings army, which also explains why they're glitchy. Each of the batch has been made with slightly different techniques and they want to find the method that works best. They came out here to find patriotic citizens away from potential spies who'll do this job for the good of the realm (expendable peasants far away from anything valuable who'll ask no questions when confronted with piles of gold).

&amp;#x200B;

There's a mineshaft full of gnolls to get them started with some ready test subjects and a rough map of the region.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to add brackets to the contract so they can cash-out for a partial payment every 25 wands, but that doesn't really help with wrapping up if they don't wish to. I'm thinking maybe having the wizard find them and pay them out anyway as their boss has realised what a terrible idea testing them this way was. But I'm not 100% sold on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also thinking about dialling down the number of missiles the wands make to force them to use more wands. Or at least making it so you can only hit a single target per use. The 3-session game documented above has only used about 75 of the 300 wands in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

For prep I'm going to have a bunch of character sheets partially filled out with the commoner stats ( core rules, page 449 ) so it'll just be naming &amp; quick dice rolling. I'll have some fully made out too in case.

I'm going to have a tonne of stickynotes ready to keep track of all the status effects they're likely to accumulate (with and without realising). And I'm going to have my one-minute egg-timer ready to break out in case metagaming delays the turns. I'll also have the secret copy of the wands effects so far, not just what the players interpret the effects to be.

A soul contract in this case being that the hags grant some special request to the player who's doing the bargain, and he signs his soul as surety to perform a certain unnamed task for the hags. For cinematic effect I even had the initial signing player's soul broadcast a powerful light emanating out of his chest, forcing all onlookers to shield their eyes, and it traveled down the course of the players arm and into the open wound on his thumb where he blood-inked the soul contract, then binding the soul into the scroll. (However, the player is still allowed to run around the world to perform the task, sort of like a lich with his phylactery - if the PC reneges on the deal or cannot complete the task to the hags' satisfaction, then his soul is forfeit).

   But here's the problem:

   After the game, I went to look up what spells I could have used to justify in how to bind a soul to a contract and I'm not finding anything that's very suitable. Geas is too limited.

####Appearance  

This lanky dragon’s dappled grayish scales and sprawling wings shift and fade in color, blending in with the mist.

####CR   5
#####Alignment:  NE
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  

Fogburst (Su) As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 × 5 feet from the center of the fogburst’s area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as obscuring mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Fogvision (Ex) A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation.

Misty Camouflage (Ex) A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed.

Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.

#####  
*****
####Ecology  

Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim’s allies can regroup and come to its rescue.

Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years.

A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

I am currently a level 5 almost level 6 human unchained zen archer in a rise of the runelords campaign. Everymans unchained zen archer seems to round off at level 13 with ki focus bow, giving me at least 7 levels to play with. I am interested in a possible dip into the arcane archer prestige class. I’m thinking of doing zen archer 13/Empyreal Sorcerer 1/ Arcane archer 3/ 3 either zen archer or sorcerer. Which level would be the most appropriate time to start the arcane archer multiclassing and what order should it be done in or would it be better to just stay full zen archer? 

For Ki powers, my DM is not allowing me to take the Qinggong power (so no barkskin), so what would be the best ki powers to invests in?

Also does a Ki focus property allow my monks unarmed strike damage to apply to my bow attacks or just the abilities used with an unarmed strike (ki strike, stunning fist, etc)?

Thanks in advance for the help and advice.

Everyman Unchained provides the following changes:

· Flurry of bows: follows unchained monks’ flurry of blows, but only with bows

· Perfect strike at level 1 &amp; allows to roll 3x at level 10; replaces stunning fist

· Way of the bow: Weapon focus at level 2, weapon specialization at level 6; replaces evasion

· Ki pool at level 3: spend 1 ki point, increase bow range by 50 ft for 1 round

· Zen Archery at level 4: Wis instead of Dex on bow ranged attacks; replaces 4th level ki power

· Point blank master at level 4; replaces still mind

· Ki arrows at level 5: spend 1 ki point to get unarmed damage to arrows for 1 round; replaces still mind

· Maneuver Shot at 5th level: designate 1 attack in a flurry of blows and if the attack hits, make a free combat maneuver; replaces style strikes

o At level 9 and every 4 levels after, learn another maneuver shot. At level 15 can designate 2 attacks in a flurry of blows as maneuver shots. 

o Maneuvers that can be learned: bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, reposition, sunder, trip

· Reflexive shot at level 9: make AoO with bow; replaces improved evasion

· Trick shot at level 12: spend 1 ki point to ignore concealment, spend 2 to ignore total concealment or cover, spend 3 to ignore total cover even firing arrows around corners; replaces 12th level ki power

0,0,16,2,"So one of my players threw a fit last session, told me he wants his character to do something right for a change, and that he was ""distinctly unsatisfied with the quality"" of the last several sessions.

Two problems, inter-related, one of which is my fault:

I'm a new GM and this is my first campaign, and I have a problem with pacing and with social rolls. There were a couple of incidents where my players rolled high for something but didn't make an argument the NPC would find convincing, so I didn't let the argument succeed, which I probably should have done anyway. My player got mad about this after I did it twice, once to him and once to another character, since I wasn't rewarding high rolls. (I talked it out with my players and we decided that I should set the DCs according to the quality of their arguments. I did warn that I would set crappy arguments very high, though, since this is a talky game and they're putting all their points in Diplomacy now. I'm thinking of putting a cap on how many points you can have in it just so it's not roll-to-win for them.) This player was just trying to brute force his way through every social interaction by banging his staff on the ground and yelling what he wanted loudly, and then rolling Intimidate, which he put a ton of ranks in. When he did that again I wanted to make it more difficult/fun for him. He tried it and rolled really well. I don't think I handled it very well, but I said the DC was very high because the player didn't understand the NPC's native language and looked poorly on outsiders. He got upset, told me he was uncomfortable with me not rewarding a high roll, and had his character quit the main quest, go to the local university, and refuse to get back to the rest of the party until his character had learned the language.

(Later he said that he thinks playing a mentally unstable character was messing him up and causing him to act out like this, so we came up with a cool way to retire the character.)

In the last session, he rolled to understand some papers a scholar NPC wrote, and I told him they make no sense at all, which is useful information and not a reflection on his character's ability to understand something, which seemed to be understood. Unfortunately, I didn't really let him react to it or try to stop the scholar's mad plans before moving on with the scene, since again I'm a new GM and I sort of have pacing problems. We're running over Discord (text-based) and I try to avoid having two minutes of everyone sitting there in silence while my players decide whether or not they want to type something. It's a delicate balance. So understand that I did make a mistake and he was already upset that session, and that I've made some bad calls on how to reward high rolls before.

But later in the session, during the final scene: he and his character expressed a repeated desire to help an NPC who was Balefully Polymorphed. The session before last I gave him a cursebreaker. The NPC insisted several times that he didn't want to be helped and to only reverse the curse if there's an emergency. I put the NPC in the game so that my players had a nuke they could set off if it looks like they were heading towards a TPK or other disaster, and the players know that. The NPC didn't want them to know that if they reversed the curse he'd likely die in a few minutes, just long enough to help them, because he thought they'd never use the cursebreaker if he did. (Probably true, he's a well-loved NPC.) Despite having a lot of warning both IC and OOC that using the cursebreaker would have unknown consequences, and that the NPC was terrified of its use, and that the party debated IC that he shouldn't do it, my player set the cursebreaker off at the end of the session anyway. (By the way, there were some hints in the game as to what would happen to the NPC if they referred back to certain events, but those happened so long ago I don't really count them.)

So after the session was over my player got angry and told me that he's not satisfied with the quality of the game the past few sessions, he wants his character to accomplish something right, and he's uncomfortable. (He did say he doesn't understand why he's uncomfortable, so he's as confused as I am right now.) 

I can see his point of view, and I should have given him an opportunity to stop the scholar, but I feel like what he did to the NPC merits the consequences. I'm not sure if he feels like I was setting him up to fail because I gave him a cursebreaker after him telling me he wanted to break the curse, and also didn't tell him what would happen if he used it, or if he should just accept the consequences of his actions since he was given ample warning both IC and OOC that the NPC would suffer if he did it.

Some more history: 

- the last character he played got tons of attention. He got to romance an NPC, solve the quest of the last arc (and arguably the arc before that too), and the death of that character after he wanted to retire him was designed to be very cool and introduce the campaign's villain. He gets more attention than any other PC and is usually the one suggesting a course of action. So it's not for a lack of participating in the plot, and he's had several incredible victories. Sometimes I sort of have to arrange things so that other characters get the spotlight, for instance, a character he says his PC has a crush on is interested in a different PC, so he won't be having a romance this arc. I don't know if his problem with the game comes from not getting to be the hero all the time.

- he does have a habit of getting uncomfortable and leaving the table, as I illustrated in the language example. A few sessions ago the group did a pretty standard ""somebody at the ball is an assassin, covertly find out who it is and stop them"" and he tried to solve it by shouting that a murder was about to take place, and an NPC quietly told him that he could ruin the target's reputation if he did that. (I was willing to let it play out his way so I wasn't railroading him, but I did want it known that this was a factor in why they asked the party to do it discreetly and there would have been consequences for the NPC.) But then he said he was uncomfortable playing out something so confrontational (he really likes using the word uncomfortable) and left the table again, I just had the guards take his character off for questioning and proceeded as usual.

All of my other players are comfortable and fine with everything I've done, and we've had open and fruitful negotiations about how to handle stuff like PvP when it comes up, or my issue with social rolls. None of them have exhibited anything close to this player's behavior, so I can't figure out where it's coming from or how to fix it. Aside from rewarding good rolls (and there've been dozens of them I've successfully rewarded and only these two or three I've really fucked up on) which we agree I need to work on.

Aside from all this I can't think of anything I've done wrong. Sorry if the post is long, I wanted to be exhaustive about it. 

Mostly, I'm concerned about the next session. The NPC is going to seriously suffer next session and possibly die. They'll have a good chance to save him and his life might otherwise be spared, but it's probably going to be legitimately uncomfortable knowing that your PC did that to a character you loved when you didn't mean to do it. I want to know what to do to keep him calm and prevent him from leaving the table in the middle of the session, especially if he rolls badly and something he tries doesn't work.

Does anybody have any idea why this player is getting repeatedly upset, what I'm doing wrong, and how to get him to relax? I can't figure out if I'm being too harsh or if he's just upset that not everything goes well for him. ",pathfinder_test,I keep making one of my players upset and I'm not sure why

0,0,6,2,"NOTE: If any of my own players see this: GET OUT!

&amp;#x200B;

I want some other GM's opinions on what you would do in this scenario.

Overview: I am running my first live campaign (ie not on Roll20) of the Giantslayer AP. Currently in Book 1. My 4 players are all pretty green to tabletop RPG's generally, and is the first campaign ever for 3 of them. I'm still at the stage where my players are still developing agency in looking up rules/always putting me on the spot to know what can be done when they do something unexpected. It's not bad, but I get overwhelmed by stuff like the following:

The party made the very foolish decision of splitting the party during the most significant combat portion of the book. Being the kind of GM that I am, I don't want to pull punches, so 2 members (the ranger and the cleric) of the party get backed into a burning building by 3 orcs, an encounter which they are overmatched (because the book is written that assumes the party won't split in a war zone).

The cleric, feeling she doesn't have alternative, runs out past the lead orc to get out the burning building and corner they have gotten themselves backed into. The lead orc crits on his AoO with his falchion – which mathematically should have killed the cleric (damage in excess of their CON) and, because the players agreed to subscribe to my rather lethal critical hit/fumble charts, removed her shield arm at the wrist.

It was at this point, that our session last week ended, as one player had to go catch a bus.

Now, the cleric will expend Hero Points (following RAW in their use), at the start of next session to not die/keep their hand. At this point, Paizo says it is at my discretion how I enable the cleric to cheat death.

&amp;#x200B;

There some factors that I am having difficulty weighting:

1) The players are new, including the cleric. They are still learning the rules, and have no concept of Pathfinder's metagame (ie splitting the party at such a critical time is always going to be a poor choice).

2) I made the ruling because of the split, that it will take another 2 rounds before the rest of the party catches up (the bard and fighter were dealing with a different conflict, which they actually succeeded brilliantly at).

3) I am concerned that if I let the cleric go unconscious here (with all the party's heals), as suggested by the Hero Points rules, that it will lead to a death spiral, as the players are not great at tactics and managing action economy, and are basically going to end up coming up to the orcs one at a time.

4) At the same time as all this, I want to be fair and honest, and teach them that their decisions have consequences.

5) my inclination immediately following the end of last session was to let the cleric avoid death and dismemberment, but drop them to dangerously low hitpoints, effectively using their Hero Points to make the orc fail to confirm the crit. Then say something at the time, or after the fight, about how the campaign is designed around them staying together to avoid situations like this in the future (they haven't done anything this foolhardy so far), and then be unforgiving about such errors in the future.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Elemental Projectile(Ex)**

As a standard action, a scorching capuchin can instantly ignite a small object in its hands and throw it at a target within 30ft. as a ranged touch attack. Upon impact, it deals 1d6 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has and can ignite flammable objects. This ability can be used once every 1d4 rounds.

**Burning Bond (Ex)**

As a move action, a scorching capuchin can enter the skin of a willing creature that has no resistance or immunity to fire. He then transforms into a burn on the skin of that creature. When doing so, he deals 1d4 fire damage to the host creature upon entering his body. In this form, the scorching capuchin can not be targeted or attacked directly and only takes half damage when the host is damaged by an area of effect spell.  Also, he cannot take any action except to exit the host creature as a move action.

The scorching capuchin can also use this ability offensively. In this case, it takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the scorching capuchin must also succeed at a melee touch attack to enter an unwilling creature with no resistance or immunity to fire. If the scorching capuchin succeeds, he may enter the skin of the creature and deal 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has to the creature. Each round the scorching capuchin stays in the skin of the creature, the creature must make a DC 14 fortitude save. If it succeeds the scorching capuchin is expelled from it’s skin. If it does not succeed, it take 1d4 fire damage for every three hit dice the scorching capuchin has. The scorching capuchin may also exit the creature as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Fire-like Fur(Ex)**

The scorching capuchin’s body is covered in a special fur that has many fire-like properties. First, the fur glows as if the scorching capuchin were affected by the light spell. This effect does not work if the scorching capuchin is using his Burning Bond ability. Second, the scorching capuchin can produce heat with its fur. Anyone striking the scorching capuchin with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of fire damage.

I wanted your opinion on the rules I've drafted for the alchemist's. He's playing a Dr Jekyll / Mr Hyde situation. To make the handicap, I want to encourage 'Hyde' to come up consistently, not just when it's convient for combat. So what I've got is below. 

-----

After the mutegen wears off, a countdown begins. After 12 hours 'Hyde' fights to come out again, and it takes constant willpower from the alchemist to suppress him.

Each hour the PC must take a Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level) or become fatigued from the effort to hold 'Hyde' back. 
In addition, every hour the alchemist takes 1 point of non lethal damage. This does not heal normally, and can only be removed by Cure spells, or transforming in Hyde, which removes all the damage dealt from holding back.

####Appearance  

This large, brown, horse-like creature has a hawk’s wings, talons, and hooked beak.

####CR   2
#####Alignment:  N
#####Size:   Large
####Special Abilities  



#####  
*****
####Ecology  

The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.

A hippogriff’s feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff’s torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.

Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.

Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature’s wings—these saddles are always exotic saddles.

Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young—as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff’s egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load.

I’ve recently become interested in playing a dark tapestry mystery oracle and have been having some difficulty choosing the right curse.

These are all class features of the two weapon warrior archetype: I was considering adding them as feats considering that the archetype is generally considered trash.  


  

Double Strike

Prerequisites improved Two weapon fighting, Bab +6

As a standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.  


Improved Balance

Improved Two weapon Fighting, bab +8

The attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by –1 for a two-weapon warrior. Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties.

  
Equal Opportunity

Improved Two Weapon fighting, Double Strike, Bab +11

when You make an attack of opportunity, you may attack once with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.

I'd appreciate any feedback and thanks for looking.  


Questions to consider:  
Does adding these as feats add to or take away from the game in general?  


What are fair prerequisites? I put in placeholders that I think are fair on the surface but I didn't put in too much thought
